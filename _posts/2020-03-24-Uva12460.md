title: Uva 12460  Careful Teacher
---


## Input

```
Once upon a time there was a teacher that wanted to teach his students all the words in the dictionary.
To do so, he started selecting by memory two words of the dictionary, and wanted their students to
be changing the leters of the words, one by one, so that the original word eventually got converted
into the final word, but with the restriction that every step only a letter could be changed, and, very
importantly, each intermediate word must also be part of the dictionary.

You have to help the teacher to know beforehand if a word can be changed into another word, one
letter at a time, and each intermediate word belonging to a given dictionary, so that the teacher can
select interesting examples to his students.
```

## Output

```
Your program receives a list of (different) words, one each line, forming the dictionary, a line to end the
dictionary, with the characters --, and several lines, each containing two words separated by a space
(starting word and ending word, respectively). For each pair, you have to tell if the first word can be
converted into the second using the given dictionary. The dictionary will have fewer than 20000 words.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input word pair, your program must print Yes if the first word can be converted into the
second, or No if it cannot be done.

```

## Sample Output

```
abc
abd
acc
bbb
aba
--
abc acc
abc bbb
acc abd
bbb abc
abd abc
aba abc

```
