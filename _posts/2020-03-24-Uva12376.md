## Input

```text
What makes problem solving so interesting? What makes it challenging? Why we put so much effort
on it but never get bored? For us (problem-setters), its like As long as I learn, I live! We learn so
many beautiful things, we find great ideas and techniques and there is no end to it.

In this problem, you are given a persons life stages in graph form. There are n nodes in the graph.
Nodes represent stages, numbered from 0 to n  1, and edges represents that he can move from one
stage to another. 0th node is the node where he starts his journey. You may have guessed; there will
be no cycles in the graph (no one can back to past!).

In each node, a value x is attached, it means he will learn x units, if he comes into this node.
For example, the graph in the picture represents a persons life stages. The circles present nodes, the
value in a circle represents that it will be gained if the person comes into this node. The numbers in
rectangular boxes represents the node ids. If the person reaches the 1st node he will learn 8 added
units, if he reaches 4th node, he will learn 7 added units.

As in real life, no one knows the future, but can predict some common things in near future. If the
person is in node u, he only knows the nodes that have an edge from u. The person wants to learn
more, thats why, he always takes the stage that looks better, i.e. has maximum value. So, if he is in
node 0, he only knows the learning units in node 1 and 2, but doesnt know about nodes 3, 4, or 5. He
will prefer node 2 over node 1 (because node 2 will give him 9 learning units). He continues journey in
this method. He can finish at any stage, but will try to learn more. You can assume that the graph
is given such that from any node, the next node can be picked deterministically i.e. from any node u,
there will be exactly one node v which has the maximum value and there is an edge from u to v.

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a blank line. Next line contains two integers n (2  n  100) and m
(n  1  m  n  (n  1)/2), n denotes the number of nodes in the graph and m denotes the number
of edges in the graph. The next line contains n space separated integers denoting the learning units in
the nodes respectively. The values will be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) except the 0th node will have
a value 0. Each of the next m lines contains two integers u v (0  u, v < n, u = v) meaning that there
is a directed edge from u to v. You can safely assume that the given graph will follow the restrictions

described above. And from 0th node, it can be possible to go to any node. There will be at most one
edge between any pair of nodes.

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number and the maximum total learning units the person can gain
(following the strategy mentioned above) and the node id where the person ends journey.
