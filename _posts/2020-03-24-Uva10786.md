title: Uva 10786  Qualify for the Champions League

## Input

```text
UEFA Champions League is considered as the worlds
greatest football club competition. The top teams
from the best leagues of Europe win the right to par-
ticipate in this contest. The number of teams that
will participate in the Champions League is decided
by the UEFA coefficient ranking system. This sys-
tem takes individual club performances in Europe and
performance of all the clubs of a country into account.
So the number of clubs participating in the Champi-
ons league is not necessarily proportional to the num-
ber of teams competing in the domestic league.

The table to the left shows the standings of the
group stages of Champions League after 4 games have
been played. As we can see, there are 4 teams from
the English Premier League (Liverpool, Manchester
United, Arsenal and Chelsea), 4 teams from Span-
ish Primera Liga (Deportivo, Real Madrid, Barcelona
and Valencia), 4 teams from Italian Serie A (Roma,
Juventus, Inter and Milan) but only 3 teams from
German Bundes Liga (Leverkusen, Bayern, Bremen).
Now the numbers of teams that play in those domes-
tic leagues are not equal (20 in Premier League, 18
in Serie A), nor do they have a uniform ranking rule.
For example in Primera Liga if two teams are tied in
points then the goal difference comes as a deciding
factor. But for the Champions League itself, a tie in
points is broken by the number of goals scored. What
has remained to be uniform in the league rules is that

a win would earn 3 points for a team, a draw would earn 1 and a loss would earn nothing. It is also a
tradition to have the teams play each other twice on a home and away basis. But at times it may be
required to have the league played in half a season, when theyd play with each other only once.

Now keeping all these anomalies in mind, we are interested to find the minimum point that a team
can score and be lucky enough to qualify. You would be given the number of teams  T , the number
of times they would play each other  V , and the number of teams that can qualify  Q. To avoid
the differences in the tie-breaking rules we would like to see our qualifying teams get at least one point
more than the ones that are left out. For example, in a league that has only 4 teams who play each
other twice if we are to choose 2 qualifiers, we would say that the 2nd team would require at least 5
points to qualify. This 5-point difference is the minimum bar that a team should reach if they are to
have any hope of moving on.

## Output

```text
There can be multiple test cases. The first line of input gives you the number of test cases, T (1  T 
100). Each of the next T lines would give you the input for each of the test cases. N (1 < N  20), V
(1  V  4) and Q (1  Q  N) are the three integers comprising one test case.
