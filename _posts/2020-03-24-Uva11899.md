title: Uva 11899  Writing the Whole
---


## Input

```
Unless you are living under the rock you may have heard the
name of Nawab SiRaj-ud-doula (we call him NSR for simplic-
ity). If you indeed live under the rock then let me say something
about him. He was smart and very good at programming and
mathematics. One of his favorite hobbies is to write the  to its
whole, 3.14159. As you might be wondering 3.14159 is not the
whole of  and his friends say so.

His friends tried to convince him that he cant write irrational
numbers to their whole. As an example they say that even 3.14159
is not the best approximation of  using 7 symbols. It is 355/113.
This made NSR interested. So he decided to ask his friends for
good approximation of different irrational numbers.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input will contain T ( 10000) denoting the number of cases.

Each case contains three integers m (1 < m  10), n (1 < n  10000) and p (1 < p  10). Now
NSR wants you to find the best approximation of m-th root of n using at most p symbols. You may
assume that it will always be an irrational number. You may also assume that n < 10pm. For this
problem, digits, . and / are treated as symbols. To make the problem easier, at most one non-digit
symbol can be used to approximate the number.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and the approximation as described in problem statement. If
there are multiple solutions, output the one with least number of symbols. If there is still a tie, output
the lexicographically earlier one.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
4 2 8
4 2 9

```
