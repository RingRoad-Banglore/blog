title: Uva 10651  Pebble Solitaire

## Input

```
Pebble solitaire is an interesting game. This is a game where you are given a board with an arrangement
of small cavities, initially all but one occupied by a pebble each. The aim of the game is to remove
as many pebbles as possible from the board. Pebbles disappear from the board as a result of a move.
A move is possible if there is a straight line of three adjacent cavities, let us call them A, B, and C,
with B in the middle, where A is vacant, but B and C each contain a pebble. The move constitutes of
moving the pebble from C to A, and removing the pebble in B from the board. You may continue to
make moves until no more moves are possible.

In this problem, we look at a simple variant of this game, namely a board with twelve cavities
located along a line. In the beginning of each game, some of the cavities are occupied by pebbles. Your
mission is to find a sequence of moves such that as few pebbles as possible are left on the board.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a positive integer n on a line of its own. Thereafter n different games follow.
Each game consists of one line of input with exactly twelve characters, describing the twelve cavities of
the board in order. Each character is either - or o (The fifteenth character of English alphabet in
lowercase). A - (minus) character denotes an empty cavity, whereas a o character denotes a cavity
with a pebble in it. As you will find in the sample that there may be inputs where no moves is possible.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each of the n games in the input, output the minimum number of pebbles left on the board possible
to obtain as a result of moves, on a row of its own.
