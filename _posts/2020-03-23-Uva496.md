496 Simply Subsets
After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, you obtained a job at Top Shelf Software, Inc., as
an entry-level computer engineer. On the first day, your manager sits down with you and tasks you with
the following job: “We want to see how well you understand computer programming and the abstract
science behind it. As an evaluation for all of our new hires, we require them to write a program to
determine the relationship between pairs of sets. I’m quite sure that you’ll do well; my confidence is
high. Here’s a list of requirements for what the program should do. Good luck.”

## Input
Your program should accept an even number of lines of text. Each pair of lines will represent two sets;
the first line represents set A, the second line represents set B. Each line of text (set) will be a list of
distinct integers.

## Output
After each pair of lines has been read in, the sets should be compared and one of the following responses
should be output:

• A is a proper subset of B

• B is a proper subset of A

• A equals B

• A and B are disjoint

• I'm confused!

## Sample Input
<p>55 27</p><p>55 27</p><p>9 24 1995</p><p>9 24</p><p>1 2 3</p><p>1 2 3 4</p><p>1 2 3</p><p>4 5 6</p><p>1 2</p><p>2 3</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>A equals B</p><p>B is a proper subset of A</p><p>A is a proper subset of B</p><p>A and B are disjoint</p><p>I'm confused!</p>
