title: Uva 10601  Cubes
---


## Input

```text
You are given 12 rods of equal length. Each of them is colored in certain color. Your task is to
determine in how many different ways one can construct a cube using these rods as edges. Two cubes
are considered equal if one of them could be rotated and put next to the other, so that the corresponding
edges of the two cubes are equally colored.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains T (1  T  60), the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each
test case consists of one line containing 12 integers. Each of them denotes the color of the corresponding
rod. The colors are numbers between 1 and 6.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output for one test consists of one integer on a line  the number of ways one can construct a
cube with the described properties.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6
