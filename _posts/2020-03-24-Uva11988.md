title: Uva 11988  Broken Keyboard (a.k.a. Beiju Text)
---


## Input

```text
Youre typing a long text with a broken keyboard. Well its not so badly broken. The only problem with
the keyboard is that sometimes the home key or the end key gets automatically pressed (internally).

Youre not aware of this issue, since youre focusing on the text and did not even turn on the
monitor! After you finished typing, you can see a text on the screen (if you turn on the monitor).

In Chinese, we can call it Beiju. Your task is to find the Beiju text.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases. Each test case is a single line containing at least one and at most 100,000
letters, underscores and two special characters [ and ]. [ means the Home key is pressed internally,
and ] means the End key is pressed internally. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the Beiju text on the screen.

```

## Sample Output

```text
This_is_a_[Beiju]_text
[[]][][]Happy_Birthday_to_Tsinghua_University

```
