```
The Stirling number of the second kind S(n,m) represents the number of ways to partition a set of n
things into m nonempty subsets. For example, there are seven ways to split a four-element set into two
parts:

{1, 2, 3}  {4}, {1, 2, 4}  {3}, {1, 3, 4}  {2}, {2, 3, 4}  {1},

{1, 2}  {3, 4}, {1, 3}  {2, 4}, {1, 4}  {2, 3}.

We can compute S(n,m) using the recurrence,

S(n,m) = mS(n 1,m) + S(n 1,m 1), for integers 1 < m < n.

but your task is slightly different: given integers n and m, compute the parity of S(n,m), i.e. S(n,m)
mod 2.

Example
S(4, 2) mod 2 = 1.

Write a program that reads two positive integers n and m, computes S(n,m) mod 2, and writes the
result.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The input consists two integers n and m separated by a space, with 1  m  n  1000000000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

The output should be the integer S(n,m) mod 2.
