```

You have been hired by Addictive Coin Machines to help design the next hit in their line of eye-catching,
coin-guzzling, just-one-more-try Pachinko machines for casinos around the world.

Playing a Pachinko machine involves launching balls into a rectangular grid filled with pegs, ob-
stacles, and targets. The ball bounces around the grid until it eventually hits one of the targets. The
player earns a certain number of points depending on which target is hit.

The grid pattern for the next Pachinko machine has already been designed, but point values for
the targets have not been assigned. These must be set so that like all casino machines, the machine is
profitable but not too profitable. Thus it is important to figure out the probability of a ball hitting any
particular target. Thats your job!

For simplicity, the grid is modeled as a tall rectangle filled with mostly-open spaces (each represented
by .), impassable obstacles (each represented by X), and targets (each represented by T).

A ball is launched randomly with uniform probability into one of the mostly-open spaces on the top
row of the grid. From that point on, collisions with pegs cause the ball to randomly bounce up, down,
left, or right, with various given probabilities. For simplicity, assume these probabilities are the same
for every space in the grid. If the ball bounces into an obstacle or attempts to move off the grid, it
wont actually move from its current space. When the ball moves into a target it is removed from play.

You can safely assume that the average number of spaces visited by a ball before hitting a target
will not exceed 109. It would not make for a very enjoyable game if the ball just bounces forever!

For each target, calculate the probability that it is the one hit by a launched ball.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line contains integers w and h, which are the width and height of the Pachinko grid
(1  w  20 and 2  h  10000). The next line contains four non-negative integers u, d, l, and r,
which sum to 100 and are the percentage probabilities of the ball bouncing up, down, left, or right from
any open space.

Each of the next h lines contains w characters, each of which is ., X, or T. These lines describe
the Pachinko grid. The first line, which describes the top row of the grid, contains at least one . and
no Ts.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below, on a line by itself.

Display one line for each T in the grid, in order from top to bottom, breaking ties left to right. For
each target, display the probability that a launched ball will hit it. Give the answer with an absolute
error of at most 106 .

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
