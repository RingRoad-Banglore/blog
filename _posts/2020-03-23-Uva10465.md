Homer Simpson, a very smart guy, likes eating Krusty-burgers. It takes
Homer m minutes to eat a Krusty-burger. However, there’s a new type of
burger in Apu’s Kwik-e-Mart. Homer likes those too. It takes him n min-
utes to eat one of these burgers. Given t minutes, you have to find out the
maximum number of burgers Homer can eat without wasting any time. If he
must waste time, he can have beer.

## Input

m,n, t (0 < m,n, t < 10000). Input is terminated by EOF.

Homer can eat without having beer. If homer must have beer, then also print the time he gets for
