```

Oh no! Bill just realized that the sudoku puzzle he had spent
the last ten minutes trying to solve essentially was last weeks
puzzle, only rotated counterclockwise. How cheap! Couldnt
the magazine afford to make a new one every week? Of course,
he had no way of knowing about this before he started to solve
it, as the holes to fill with digits were other than last week.
Nevertheless, realizing that this weeks puzzle was a simple
derivative of last weeks certainly took the fun out of solving
the rest of it.

The sudoku board consists of 9  9 cells. These can be
grouped into 33 regions of 33 cells each. Some of the cells
are filled with a digit 1 through 9 while the rest of them are
left empty. The aim of the game is to fill each empty cell with a digit 1 . . . 9 so that every row, every
column and every region contains each of the numbers 1 . . . 9 exactly once. A proper sudoku puzzle
always has exactly one solution.

Help Bill avoid unpleasant surprises by creating a program that checks whether an unsolved sudoku
puzzle is in fact derived from an earlier puzzle by simple operations.

The allowed operations are:

1. Rotating the entire puzzle clockwise or counterclockwise.

2. Swapping two columns within a 3 9 column segment.

3. Swapping two rows within a 9 3 row segment.

4. Swapping entire row or column segments.

5. Applying a permutation f of the digits 1 . . . 9 to every cell (i.e. replace x by f(x) in every cell).

An operation is considered being performed on the sudoku solution (rather than on the unsolved
puzzle) and always guarantees that if the board before the transformation was a solution to a sudoku
puzzle, it still is afterwards.

## Input

```
The input starts with the number of test cases 0  N  50 on a single line.
Then for every test case follow nine lines describing last weeks puzzle solution, from top to bottom.

Each line corresponds to a row in the puzzle and consists of nine digits (1 . . . 9), describing the contents
of the cell from left to right.

Last weeks solution is followed by nine lines describing this weeks unsolved puzzle. Here, also, every
line corresponds to a puzzle row and every digit (0 . . . 9) describes the contents of a cell. 0 indicates
that the cell is empty. The rows are presented ordered from top to bottom, and within each row, the
cells are ordered from left to right.

After every test case except the last one follows a blank line. Every unsolved puzzle is guaranteed
to be uniquely solvable and last weeks solution is always a proper sudoku solution.
