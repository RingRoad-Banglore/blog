title: Uva 11422  Escaping from Fractal Bacterium
---


```
A fractal bacterium is growing very fast and you have to calculate whether you are safe from its attack
or not.

The growth of our bacteria is like a very well known fractal Koch Snowflake or Koch Island.
The growth of it is shown below:

Figure: Growth of fractal bacteria

As you can see that at day one the bacteria has the shape of an equilateral triangle. In day two the
all sides are extended outwards with the shape of another equilateral triangle whose sides are 1/3 rd of
the triangle of day 1. This process is repeated again in day 3 and onwards.

The scientists have started working on a medicine and they are confident about finding means of
killing the bacteria within 2 weeks. So if this bacterium cannot reach you within 2 weeks (Day 14)
then you are safe. Given your location and the initial position of the bacterium, you will have to find
whether you are safe or not.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 6001) which denotes the number of input
sets. Each of the next N lines makes the input for one set. Each line contains eight floating-point
numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x and y (|x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2|, |x3|, |y3|, |x|, |y|  400000). Here (x1, y1),
(x2, y2), (x3, y3) are the coordinates of three vertexes of an equilateral triangle. This equilateral triangle
denotes the position of the virus on the very first day and (x, y) is your location in Cartesian coordinate
system. From the very next day (Day 2) this bacteria will start to grow following the rule mentioned in
the problem statement. All the floating point number in the input file has 10 digits after the decimal

point. The inputs will be such that precision error will not be a problem if you use double-precision
floating point numbers.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. If the bacteria can reach you within Day 14 then
you should produce a line The bacterium destroys you within day d. ESCAPE!!, where d is
the number of days the bacteria takes to reach you. If the bacteria cannot reach you within day 14
(inclusive) then produce the line You are safe :) instead (If you are still confused  your program
should never print a number greater than 14 but can print 14 sometimes :).

Note for the Sample: Although it appears from the sample input that input for each set is scattered
in two lines, actually those two lines is a single line as shown below:
