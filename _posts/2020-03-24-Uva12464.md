```
Professors are very motivated when they have to travel abroad for a conference (of course, if fees are
paid by the university), but they dont have the same attitude when the moment to grade exams arrives.

Professor Lazy, Ph.D., has a particular way to grade exams (and very unfair, by the way). He puts
all his exams in a box and then starts getting them out one by one in a totally random fashion. He
assigns grade  to the first exam that he gets out of the box, and grade  to the second exam that he
gets out of the box. From that point on, he assigns a grade to each of the exams based on the grades
of the previous two exams. What he does is that he takes the grade of the immediately previous exam,
adds 1 and divides by the grade of the exam before the previous one.

For example, lets imagine that  = 2 and  = 3. This is what happens:

 The first exam gets  = 2.

 The second exam gets  = 3.

 The previous two grades are  and , so the third exam gets
(1 + )


=

(1 + 3)

2
= 2.

 The previous two grades are  and
(1 + )


, so the fourth exam gets

1 +
(1+)




=

1 + 2

3
= 2.

 The procedure continues until hes done with all exams.

More formally, we can define the grade Qn of the n-th exam with a recurrence like this:

Qn =




 if n = 0
 if n = 1
1+Qn1
Qn2

if n  2

Even this simple procedure is a lot of work for Professor Lazy, Ph.D., so he asks you to write a
program to do it for him. He wants to spend all day long drinking coffee in the cafeteria with other
professors. Given ,  and n find the value of Qn.

Note that the grades do not necessarily lie inside a fixed range. They are just arbitrary integers.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases (at most 1000). Each test case is described by three integer
numbers ,  and n on a single line (1  ,   109 and 0  n  1015).

The last line of the input contains three zeros and should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write the value of Qn in a single line. The input will be such that the value of Qn
is always an integer. Furthermore, Qi will never be zero for 0  i  n (in other words, division by zero
will never arise when evaluating the recurrence).
