## Input

```

Association of Collision Management (ACM) is planning to perform the controlled collision of two
asteroids. The asteroids will be slowly brought together and collided at negligible speed. ACM expects
asteroids to get attached to each other and form a stable object.

Each asteroid has the form of a convex polyhedron. To increase the chances of success of the
experiment ACM wants to bring asteroids together in such manner that their centers of mass are as
close as possible. To achieve this, ACM operators can rotate the asteroids and move them independently
before bringing them together.

Help ACM to find out what minimal distance between centers of mass can be achieved.

For the purpose of calculating center of mass both asteroids are considered to have constant density.

## Output

```
Input file contains several datasets, separated by a blank line. Each dataset contains two descriptions
of convex polyhedra.

The first line of each description contains integer number n  the number of vertices of the polyhe-
dron (4  n  60). The following n lines contain three integer numbers xi, yi, zi each  the coordinates
of the polyhedron vertices (104  xi, yi, zi  104). It is guaranteed that the given points are vertices of
a convex polyhedron, in particular no point belongs to the convex hull of other points. Each polyhedron
is non-degenerate.

The two given polyhedra have no common points.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset, output one floating point number  the minimal distance between centers of mass
of the asteroids that can be achieved. Your answer must be accurate up to 105.
