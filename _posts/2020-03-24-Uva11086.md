title: Uva 11086  Composite Prime
---


## Input

```
A prime number is a number that cannot be factored. More precisely, a number p is a prime if it has
only the trivial divisors i.e. 1 and p. The set of prime numbers is a subset of the set of natural numbers
(the set of natural numbers is normally denoted by N).

Let us consider another subset of N . Let us call this set M . A number m is a member of M if
m = x  y where x > 1 and y > 1. Both x and y are natural numbers.

Now you have to find the prime numbers for this new set of number. Let us call these numbers
composite prime. A composite prime is a number in M that does not have any divisor (except
itself) in the set M .

Note: 1 is the first positive natural number and this is not a prime but in new number set first number
is 4 and you have to keep in mind that this is the first composite prime.

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. First line of each test case contains one integer N . Following
N integers are positive-natural numbers. Input will be terminated by end-of-file.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print one line containing a single integer which indicates the number of composite
primes in the input.

Constraints

 N  220
