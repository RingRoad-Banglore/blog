title: Uva 10626  Buying Coke
---


## Input

```text
I often buy Coca-Cola from the vending machine at work. Usually I buy several cokes at once, since my
working mates also likes coke. A coke in the vending machine costs 8 Swedish crowns, and the machine
accept crowns with the values 1, 5 and 10. As soon as I press the coke button (after having inserted
sufficient amount of money), I receive a coke followed by the exchange (if any). The exchange is always
given in as few coins as possible (this is uniquely determined by the coin set used). This procedure
is repeated until Ive bought all the cokes I want. Note that I can pick up the coin exchange and use
those coins when buying further cokes.

Now, what is the least number of coins I must insert, given the number of cokes I want to buy and
the number of coins I have of each value? Please help me solve this problem while I create some harder
problems for you. You may assume that the machine wont run out of coins and that I always have
enough coins to buy all the cokes I want.
```

## Output

```text
The first line in the input contains the number of test cases (at most 50). Each case is then given
on a line by itself. A test case consists of four integers: C (the number of cokes I want to buy), n1,
n5, n10 (the number of coins of value 1, 5 and 10, respectively). The input limits are 1  C  150,
0  n1  500, 0  n5  100 and 0  n10  50.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing a single integer: the minimum number of coins needed to
insert into the vending machine.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
2 2 1 1
2 1 4 1
20 200 3 0

```
