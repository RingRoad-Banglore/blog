## Input

```text
Its a bird! Its a plane! Its coming right at us!

Although it sometimes seems like it, Superman cant fly (without a plane). Instead, he makes
super-human leaps, especially over tall buildings. Since he never knows when he will need to catch a
criminal, he cant register flight paths. To avoid hitting planes, he tries to keep his jumps as low to the
ground as he can. Given a city-scape as input, find the angle and velocity of Supermans jump that
minimizes his maximum altitude.

Recall that gravity provides an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 downwards and the formula for Supermans
vertical distance from his starting location is d(t) = vt+ 0.5 at2 where v is his initial velocity, a is his
acceleration and t is time in seconds since the start of the leap.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of a sequence of city-scapes, each of the form

n
0 d1
h2 d2
...
hn1 dn1
0 dn

Superman starts at ground level and leaps d1+ . . .+dn metres, landing at ground level and clearing
all of the buildings at heights h2 to hn1, each with the given widths. n will be at most 100.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output is the angle and initial velocity that minimizes the height that Superman attains, both appearing
on the same line. The values should be given to two decimal places and be accurate within 0.01 degrees
or m/s, as appropriate.
