title: Uva 01430  Binary Integer
---


## Input

```

An antique machine with
(
N
3

)
switches capable of processing integers in the range 0..2N  1

has just been discovered. Each switch is associated to a distinct integer in 0..2N  1 with
exactly three ones in its binary representation. By setting switches associated with number
X0, X1, . . . , XM1 to on, any integer Y passing through the machine will render a result of
Y X0 X1  . . .XM1 (here  stands for bitwise-XOR).

We are interested in the number of configurations capable of transforming integer S into T with
exactly K switches set to on. Could you write a program to help us?
```

## Output

```
There are multiple test cases in the input file.
Each test case starts with two integers, N and K (1  N  40, 0  K  min{20,

(
N
3

)
}) followed by

two binary integers, S and T , each containing exactly N bits.
Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with N = 0 and K = 0 indicates

the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, please print a single integer, the total number of ways to transform the first integer
into the second one. Since the answer could be quite large, you are only required to find the result
module 10007.

```
