title: Uva 10889  The Lost Gift
---


## Input

```text
Stan is in deep shock as he has lost some part of the precious gift given by Olie. The precious gift was
actually two boxes full of crystal balls. The crystal balls of one box were all red and that of the other
box were all black. While handing over the gift Olie told him with a wicked smile, Stan! If you mix
the balls of the two boxes well and randomly pick two balls from the mixture, the probability of them
being the same color is 1/2. Stan was returning home merrily with the two boxes, but suddenly the
box containing black balls fell from his hand and the black balls scattered all around the place. Stan
looked all around the place and was able to collect at least 70% of the black balls. Given the total
number of red balls and the number of black balls found your job is to find out the number of lost black
balls.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 1001 lines of input. Each line contains two positive integers R and B.
Here R is the total number of red balls and B is the number of black balls found by Stan. Input is
terminated by a line containing two zeroes, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. If the number of red balls R is invalid according to
the above story then print No. of red balls invalid. If the number of red balls is valid but the
number of black balls found seems invalid then print the line No. of black balls invalid instead.
If the total number of red balls and black balls found seems valid then print in a single line one or more
integers. All these integers denote the possible number of lost black balls. These numbers should be
separated by a single space and sorted in ascending order.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 5
11 1
