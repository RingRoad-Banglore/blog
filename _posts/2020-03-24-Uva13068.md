title: Uva 13068  The Weakest Link
---


## Input

```text
It is clearly a literal fact that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The conversion of that notion
into a figurative phrase was established in the language in the 18th century. Thomas Reids Essays on
the Intellectual Powers of Man (1786), included this line:

In every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that
of the weakest link of the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.

In this problem a chain of length n is a string C = c1c2 . . . cn of n lowercase characters where
cn is considered to be followed by c1 in a cyclical fashion. Character i is said to be weaker than
character j in a chain C if the string cici+1 . . . cnc1 . . . ci1 comes before the string cjcj+1 . . . cnc1 . . . cj1
in lexicographical order.

Given a chain C, your task is to find the weakest character in C.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains a non-negative integer N indicating the number of test cases. Each
test case comprises a single line with a nonempty string C of at most 60 000 lowercase characters of the
English alphabet a-z. You may assume that a < b <    < z as usual.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing an integer w such that cw is the weakest character in the
chain C. If there is more than one such value, then output the smallest one.
