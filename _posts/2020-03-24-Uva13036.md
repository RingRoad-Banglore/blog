title: Uva 13036  Birthday Gift to SJ  2
---


## Input

```
Today is your best friend SJs birthday. You want to buy a birthday present for her. You want to buy
such a present that she likes the most. You are very superstitious. You think that, SJ will love your
gift, if the price of the present you buy is an interesting number (pretty weird isnt it :P ).

An interesting number is such a number that can be expressed as a product of Fibonacci
numbers (not necessarily distinct). For example, 16 (2*2*2*2), 40 (8*5) are interesting numbers but
7 is not.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input is an integer t (t  1000) denoting the number of test cases. Then t line
follows. Each line has two integers a and b (1  a  b  1018).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case you have to print an integer in a line denoting the maximum interesting number
between a and b (inclusive). Print -1 in case there is no solution.

```
