title: Uva 01228  Integer Transmission
---


## Input

```

Youre transmitting an n-bits unsigned integer k through a simulated network. The i-th bit counting
from left is transmitted at time i (e.g. 4-bit unsigned integer 5 is transmitted in this order: 0-1-0-1).
The network delay is modeled as follows: if a bit is transmitted at time i, it may arrive at as early as
i+1 and as late is i+d+1, where d represents the maximal network delay. If more than one bit arrived
at the same time, they could be received in any order.

For example, if youre transmitting a 3-bit unsigned integer 2 (010) for d = 1, you may receive 010,
100 (first bit is delayed) or 001 (second bit is delayed).

Write a program to find the number of different integers that could be received, and the small-
est/largest ones among them.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. Each case consists of three integers n, d, k (1  n  64,
0  d  n, 0  k < 2n), the number of bits transmitted, the maximal network delay, and the integer
transmitted. The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the number of different integers that could be received,
followed by the minimal and maximal one among them.

```

## Sample Output

```
3 0 2

3 1 2

10 2 888

7 3 107

0
