```
A group of terrorists have taken hostages on the former prison island Alcatraz (now a tourist attraction)
outside San Francisco, and is demanding a big ransom from the US government. If they are not paid
within 40 hours, they will launch 15 rockets of V.X. poison gas at San Francisco, each rocket capable
of killing 70,000 people.

The Pentagon is planning on sending a SEAL team to Alcatraz to destroy the rockets. They intend
to penetrate the island through the tunnels under the prison building, but because the prison has been
rebuilt so many times, all the maps of the tunnels are useless. The only man who can help them is
John Mason, a former inmate who once successfully escaped from Alcatraz through the tunnels.

However, Mason is getting old so he doesnt remember all the details of the tunnels. More precisely,
he knows that there is exactly one wall whose location he doesnt remember. Since theyre running out
of time, they want to make sure that they take a path which will guarantee the shortest possible time
to reach the exit of the tunnels no matter where this extra wall is. Since youre the top program writer
at the Pentagon, its your job to write the program to find this shortest path!

For simplicity, we can assume that the tunnels below Alcatraz can be described as a rectangular grid,
where each grid square is either wall or open space, and walking is permitted only between adjacent
non-wall squares. Two squares are adjacent if they have one side in common. The additional, unknown,
wall occupies exactly one square, and the team will not notice this wall until theyve reached an adjacent
square to it.

Example:

..X.....

........
##.##...
........
##.##...
##.##...
........
..E.....

If the team walks straight ahead from the entrance (E), they may face a wall at row 4 column 3, in
which case they have to turn around and the length of the path will be 17. Its better to walk to the
right immediately, as this will ensure a path of length at most 15.
```

## Input

```
The first line in the input will contain one integer n (n  10) which is the number of maps to process.
Then follows the n map descriptions.

Each map description starts with a blank line, followed by a line with two integers, describing the
number of rows and columns in the map, respectively. The map then follows one row on each line. #
is used for walls, . for open space, E is the entrance and X is the exit. The number of rows and
columns in the map is at least 3 and at most 40.

You may assume that the map is valid and that there will be exactly one entrance and one exit
square. You may also assume that there exist at least two disjoint paths (sharing no squares except
the entrance and exit) from the entrance to the exit and that the additional wall will neither be on the
entrance nor exit square.
