title: Uva 10085  The Most Distant State
---


## Input

```text
The 8-puzzle is a square tray in which eight square tiles are placed. The remaining ninth square is
uncovered. Each tile has a number on it. A tile that is adjacent to the blank space can be slid into
that space. A game consists of a starting state and a specified goal state. The starting state can be
transformed into the goal state by sliding (moving) the tiles around. The 8-puzzle problem asks you to
do the transformation in minimum number of moves.

2 8 3 1 2 3
1 6 4 => 8 4
7 5 7 6 5

Start Goal

However, our current problem is a bit different. In this problem, given an initial state of the puzzle
your are asked to discover a goal state which is the most distant (in terms of number of moves) of all
the states reachable from the given state.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains an integer representing the number of test cases to follow. A
blank line follows this line.

Each test case consists of 3 lines of 3 integers each representing the initial state of the puzzle. The
blank space is represented by a 0 (zero). A blank line follows each test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case first output the puzzle number. The next 3 lines will contain 3 integers each repre-
senting one of the most distant states reachable from the given state. The next line will contain the
shortest sequence of moves that will transform the given state to that state. The move is actually the
movement of the blank space represented by four directions: U (Up), L (Left), D (Down) and R
(Right).

After each test case output an empty line.
