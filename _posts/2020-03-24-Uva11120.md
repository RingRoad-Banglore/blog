## Input

```text
The digital expansion of the irrational number  has since long attracted all kinds of people who try to
find regularities, oddities and curiosa in it. There even are people who try to memorise as many digits
as possible, and competitions on various levels are held. If you look at the first thousand or so digits of
, you might notice the six consecutive nines, starting at place 762 ([1]):

3.

To -memorisers and other curiosa seekers, this repeat of nines is known as the Feynman point.
Wikipedia ([2]):

The name refers to a remark made by the physicist Richard Feynman, expressing a wish
to memorise the digits of  as far as that point so that when reciting them, he would be
able to end with . . . nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, and so on.

To appreciate the oddity of this repeat of six digits so early in the sequence, you may like to know
that the first repeats of six for the digits 0 to 8 occur at positions 1699927, 255945, 963024, 710100,
828499, 244453, 252499, 399579 and 222299 respectively ([3]).

The Problem
In this problem we will seek repeats in an other class of irrational numbers: the square roots of

primes upto one million. More specific, we will try to find the first occurence of a repeat of three (or
more) digits in the decimal expansion of the square root.

The number of digits that occur before the first repeat of three is called the prefix length. Among
the square roots of primes, there are quite a few that start off with three the same digits and thus have
a prefix length of zero;


79 = 8.8881944 . . .,


1109 = 33.3016516 . . . and


1973 = 44.4184646 . . . being

the first. We ignore the decimal dot, so

723407 = 850.533362 . . . has a prefix length of 4 before the

digit 3 repeats three times. Within the range specified,

581149 has the longest prefix: 1387 digits

precede the first repeat of three.

## Output

```text
A number of cases each on a line by itself. Each case consists of one number: a prime number smaller
than 1000000. The number 0 terminates the input and should not be processed.
