title: Uva 00548  Tree
---


## Input

```text
You are to determine the value of the leaf node in a given binary tree that is the terminal node of a
path of least value from the root of the binary tree to any leaf. The value of a path is the sum of values
of nodes along that path.
```

## Output

```text
The input file will contain a description of the binary tree given as the inorder and postorder traversal
sequences of that tree. Your program will read two line (until end of file) from the input file. The first
line will contain the sequence of values associated with an inorder traversal of the tree and the second
line will contain the sequence of values associated with a postorder traversal of the tree. All values will
be different, greater than zero and less than 10000. You may assume that no binary tree will have more
than 10000 nodes or less than 1 node.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each tree description you should output the value of the leaf node of a path of least value. In the
case of multiple paths of least value you should pick the one with the least value on the terminal node.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3 2 1 4 5 7 6
3 1 2 5 6 7 4
7 8 11 3 5 16 12 18
8 3 11 7 16 18 12 5
