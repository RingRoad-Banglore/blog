title: Uva 11299  Separating Rods
---


```
An experienced Nanny knows that mischievous children can never stay quiet. To keep the children
busy, Eva has decided to let the children play a game:

Given consecutive pairs of rods, A0 with A1, A1 with A2, An2 with An1, the children must
separate the pairs into two disjoint sets of these rods.

Eva allows the children to make a maximum of K separations. The objective of the game is to try
to separate the rods, such that the longest rod in one of the sets is as short as possible.

During the games, children have given various different optimal solutions. Please help her! She
wants you to help her to calculate the length of the longest rod, as well as the number of ways of
obtaining this length mod 10007.
```

## Input

```
There is a number of inputs. The first line is n, the number of rods, and k, the number of separations
allowed. (0  n  50000, 0  k  1000). The lenght of the n rods follows on the next line. (0  Ai 
20000).

```

## Output

```
On a single line output the length of the longest rod that is as short as possible, followed by the number
of ways of obtaining it.

```

## Sample Input

```
10 5
3 2 1 3 5 8 3 2 1 2
3 2
1 1 10

```

## Sample Output
