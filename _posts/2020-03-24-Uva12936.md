title: Uva 12936  Hehe
---


## Input

```
There is a Chinese joke: Chat ends with hehe. Given a chat log, count how many conversations end
with a sentence containing the word hehe (or variations, see below).

To check whether the sentence contains hehe, first replace any non-alphabetic characters with
spaces, convert the characters to lower-case and extract a list of words. For example, Hi! Are you
OK? becomes a list of 4 words: hi, are, you, ok. Note that the list of words could be empty.

Note that some people prefer to use hehehe or hehehehe instead of hehe, so a word formed
by n (n > 1) copies of he should be regarded as a variation of hehe. However, there are some other
words which contain hehe as a consecutive substring. Dont consider them!
```

## Output

```
There is only one test case. Each line is a record formatted as

Name1->Name2: sentence

Each line will have at most 1000 characters, and there will be at most 100 lines.

```

## Sample Input

```
Print the percentage (rounded to the nearest integer) of conversations ended with hehe or its variants.
The test data will be carefully chosen so that the answer will not be equally near to two integers.

Explanation
Converstation between A and B ends with Hehe.
Converstation between A and C ends with Are you there?.
Converstation between B and D ends with What does hehehei mean?.
Converstation between E and F ends with I want to hehehehehe yah.
Only the first one and the last one ends with hehe (and variants), so the answer is 50%.

```

## Sample Output

```
A->B: Hello!
A->C: Hi!
B->A: Hehe
B->D: Hei!
D->B: How are you?
A->C: Hi???
A->C: Are you there?
B->D: Hehehei!
D->B: What does hehehei mean?
F->E: I want to hehehehehe yah.

```
