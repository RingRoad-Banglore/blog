title: Uva 12730  Skyrks Bar
---


## Input

```

Skyrk has opened a bar which sells a new kind of beer. Its color is blue, and unlikely most beers, the
more you drink, you dont get drunk, you get smarter! Of course Skyrks bar was a widespread success
and people all over the world came to taste the vintage.

Too much beer makes people go to the bathroom very often, and the bathroom quickly became too
crowded. This was especially true for the mens bathroom, since men have a widely known custom of
only using an urinal if it has K empty urinals between him and any other man. This became a problem
to Skyrk because despite having several urinals, they couldnt be all used at the same time.

When a man goes to the bathroom, he chooses at random an urinal that is available given mens
picky custom. If there is no spot for him, he gets frustrated and leaves the bar. Skyrk thinks that if
the bathroom had N urinals, that would solve the problem.

But to be certain, Skyrk devised an experiment: The bathroom starts empty, and men will pick
available spots at random until there is no available spot. No man will leave the bathroom in the
meantime. What is the expected number of men that can be using the bathroom at the same time
when it becomes full?
```

urinals and the number of needed free urinals between any pair of men, correspondingly.

```

## Sample Input

```
