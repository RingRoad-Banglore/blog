title: Uva 10393  The One-Handed Typist
---


## Input

```text
Jimmy has a job of typing documents for
ACM or he rather had a job until his un-
fortunate skiing accident. With some of
his fingers in a cast, he is finding it dif-
ficult to type as he cannot press all the
keys of a keyboard and hence his job is in
danger.

Jimmy has come to you for help. He
needs to prove to his boss that he can still
type long words (his boss likes long words
because it makes him look smart). Given a list of fingers (fingers are identified by integers) that cannot
be used (due to his accident), and a list of words Jimmy can add to his bosss documents to make him
look smart, find all the longest words that Jimmy can type.

Jimmy uses standard fingering, meaning he can type each of these letters with a finger. The list
below shows a finger number and the characters it can press.

1. qaz Means finger 1 is used to type q, a, z
2. wsx Others have same meaning
3. edc
4. rfvtgb
5. space
6. space
7. yhnujm
8. ik,
9. ol.
10. p;/
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of a number of descriptions of Jimmys handicap. Each description begins with two
numbers: F , the number of fingers that Jimmy cannot use, and N  1000, the number of big words to
consider.

Following are F numbers listing the fingers Jimmy cannot use. On a standard (qwerty) keyboard
with standard finger positioning, the fingers are numbered 1 through 10 from left to right (that is, left
pinky is 1, left ring is 2, , left index is 4, left thumb is 5, right thumb is 6, , right pinky is 10).

Next are N lines, each containing one word of at most 50 characters. A word consists of small
letters only. Input terminates with end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output for each case consists of a number M indicating the number of longest words found in the list
which Jimmy can type. Following are M lines containing the list of longest words Jimmy can type.
