```
Presumably everybody knows how a knight can move on a chessboard. One may agree that its move-
ments are quite monotonous, so to make them more entertaining lets define a so called dynamic
knight. A dynamic knight can perform many different movements that may belong to three types:

 type K: two fields forward (in any direction) and one sidewise  like regular knight;

 type B: two fields diagonally  more like a bishop;

 type T: sort of teleportation to a field which is a mirror reflection with respect to any of two axes
of symmetry of the chessboard (we take into consideration only axes of symmetry parallel to sides
of the chessboard);

The picture on the right shows all possible movements of a
knight divided into three types K, B and T. Obviously our knight,
like the regular one cannot move outside the chessboard.

For a dynamic knight it is not relevant whether the fields
between the starting field and ending one are occupied or not
(again like for the regular knight). It only matters whether
the ending field is empty. Then the movement can be performed.
There has to be a restriction among so many capabilities of a
dynamic knight. It cannot perform the same sort of movements
consecutively (just not to fall into routine).

Having redefined a chess knight, why not to redefine a chess-
board? Our chessboard will be a square of size 2N  2N . N
can be any integer number from the range of 3..20. There can be several obstacles of any shape on a
chessboard so a knight cannot stop on these defected fields.

Your task is to write a program which can calculate the minimal number of movements to get the
knight from one given field to another one. It may be assumed that the first movement can be of any
type.
```

## Input

```
First line contains the number N , being the size of a chessboard. The second one contains field
coordinates separated by space character, which is a knight current standpoint. Upper left-hand size
corner has coordinates (1, 1). Third line contains destination field for the knight. Consecutive lines
contain obstacle coordinates and the line with coordinates (0, 0) ends the obstacle description. Input
can contain several sets of data.

Inputs end is shown as a line defining chessboards size as 0.

```

## Output

```
It is supposed to be fairly simple  one line with a single number being the calculated minimal number
of movements.
