title: Uva 10042  Smith Numbers
---


```
While skimming his phone directory in 1982, Albert Wilansky, a mathematician of Lehigh University,
noticed that the telephone number of his brother-in-law H. Smith had the following peculiar property:
The sum of the digits of that number was equal to the sum of the digits of the prime factors of that
number. Got it? Smiths telephone number was 493-7775. This number can be written as the product
of its prime factors in the following way:

4937775 = 3  5  5  65837

The sum of all digits of the telephone number is 4 + 9 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 42, and the sum of the
digits of its prime factors is equally 3 + 5+ 5+ 6+ 5+ 8+ 3+ 7 = 42. Wilansky was so amazed by his
discovery that he named this type of numbers after his brother-in-law: Smith numbers.

As this observation is also true for every prime number, Wilansky decided later that a (simple and
unsophisticated) prime number is not worth being a Smith number and he excluded them from the
definition.

Wilansky published an article about Smith numbers in the Two Year College Mathematics Journal
and was able to present a whole collection of different Smith numbers: For example, 9985 is a Smith
number and so is 6036. However, Wilansky was not able to give a Smith number which was larger than
the telephone number of his brother-in-law. It is your task to find Smith numbers which are larger than
4937775.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases, the number of which you are given in the first line of the input.

Each test case consists of one line containing a single positive integer smaller than 109.

```

## Output

```
For every input value n, you are to compute the smallest Smith number which is larger than n and
print each number on a single line. You can assume that such a number exists.
