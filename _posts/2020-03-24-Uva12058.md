title: Uva 12058  Highway Monitor
---


## Input

```text
The population of Mars has increased rapidly and so has the traffic on its highways. This not only
increased traffic jams but also made it difficult to locate outlaws in rush hours. So, the traffic authority
has decided to establish a monitoring system on the highway. The idea is like this they will setup some
traffic cameras at some strategic points. These cameras will constantly monitor the traffic passing by
(in both directions) and record the video footage for future analysis. The scientists working at Mars are
pretty smart. They have a large number of cities and they designed the highways as segments between
these cities (and nothing else). What this means is that each highway segment starts and finishes at
exactly two different city junctions. No two highways meet anywhere other than at a city junction.
Also note that all highway segments allow two-way traffic. In order to avoid theft of cameras, the traffic
authority wants to setup cameras only at these city junctions. The cameras can take pictures from all
directions simultaneously. So a camera at a city junction can monitor all the highway segments ending
at that junction.

Imagine yourself as a scientist in Mars. You are given a certain number of cameras and a description
of all highway segments you need to monitor. You are to determine whether it is possible to monitor
all the highway segments using the given number of cameras. Moreover, if it is possible indeed, you are
to identify the city junctions where you may place the cameras.
```

## Output

```text
The input file will contain multiple test cases. First line of input contains a single integer that specifies
how many test cases you have in the input (2 in sample input). Actual test data starts from the next
line.

First line of test data contains three integers: N , 1  N  1000, H and K, 1  K  18. Here N is
the number of city junctions, H is the number of highway segments among them and K is the number

of cameras. In the first test case of sample input we have N = 5, H = 7 and K = 2. Next H lines
describe the highway segments, one segment in each line. Each highway segment is described by two
integers x and y which specify that we have a (two-way) highway segment between city junctions x and
y. Next test case begins at the end of this highway segment list. You can assume that there is at most
15 test cases.

A cautionary note: The number of city junctions can be as high as 1000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, first you have to print the test case number as shown in the sample output. Then you
have to print yes or no depending on whether you can monitor all the described highway segments
with at most the given number of cameras. Moreover, if your answer is yes, you have to print a list
of city junctions (in any order) where you will setup the cameras. Note that there can be multiple
such lists. In this case you may print any such list that satisfies the requirement. The entire output
corresponding to a test case must be in a single line.
