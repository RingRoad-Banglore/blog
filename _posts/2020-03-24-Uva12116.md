title: Uva 12116  Dumb Grocer
---


## Input

```text
The grocer sells goods of integer amount units from
1 to n. He has a weighing scale with two pans. By
this weighing device he weighs by placing goods in
one pan and placing standard measuring stones in
another pan. His standard measuring stone set has
the following property

 Each of them has integer weight.

 The sum of all the weights of these measuring
stones is exactly n.

 Each of the weights from 1 to n can be measured
uniquely by selecting a subset of this measuring
set. If there is multiple way to measure a weight
between 1 to n then it may be problematic for
the grocer.

For n = 5 the example of valid sets are {1,2,2},
{1,1,1,1,1}, {1,1,3}. The examples of some invalid sets are

 {1,1,1,2} because 2 can be measured in multiple ways. {1,1} and {2}. Also 3 can be measured in
multiple ways. {1,1,1} and {1,2}

 {1,2,4} though all the weights from 1 to 5 can be measured in unique way but the sum of these
weights are not equal to 5.

Your task is to given n calculate the number of different valid measuring stone sets of this grocer.
```

## Output

```text
First line contains T (1  T  5000) the number of test cases. Each test case contains 1 integer n in
one line. These integers fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case produce the serial of output followed by the total number of valid measuring stone
set as described in the problem statement. This number should fit in a 64-bit signed integer. Look at
the output for sample input for details.

```

## Sample Output

```text
