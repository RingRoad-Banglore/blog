title: Uva 11441  EncodingDecoding
---


## Input

```
A good encoding program has the following properties.

 it has some different symbols.

 Each of these different symbols is encoded into different strings which contains digits from 0 to
k  1. Like for 3 different symbol and k = 2 corresponding encoding code can be 0,10,11.

 You can encode a string containing this different symbol by just concatenating their corresponding
encoding code. Like from the previous example the encoding of the string babc is 1001011.

 You select the encoding of these symbols in such a way that you can decode the encoded string
without any ambiguity. Means if you build a prefix tree with these encoding code then each of
the node will have either k child or none. Huffman tree is a good example with similar tree k = 2.

Now you have a set of n+m different symbol. But you have lost the encoding string of m of those.
Given the encoding code of the rest of the n symbols you have determine how many ways you can select
the encoding set of the lost m symbols.
```

## Output

```
First line contains T (1  T  100) the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contain 3 integer n (0  n  1000),m (1  m  200) and k (2  k  5).

Each of the next n line contains a string containing digits from 0 to k  1. This is encoding code for a
symbol. These n codes are valid. Means none of these n string will not be prefix of one another.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case find the number of way you can select the other m encoding string set. The number
of way may be huge. Output the result%10007.

```
