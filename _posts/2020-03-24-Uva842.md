## Input

```
Almost everyone is familiar with crossword puzzles. Here you have to deal with a special kind of
crossword puzzle that is adequate for an automated solver. A description of the puzzle and a list of
admissible words (the dictionary) is given, and the goal is to find the number of possible solutions, if
any exists, for the puzzle using the given dictionary.

The puzzle is represented as a grid of white and black squares. A solution is a subset of dictionary
words that fill all the sequences of horizontal or vertical white squares in such a way that all the
horizontal and vertical crossings formed are still valid dictionary words. One-letter sequences do not
need to be in the dictionary.

An example of a crossword puzzle in which white and black squares are respectively represented by
the . and # characters, a word dictionary and a solution for the puzzle is as follows:

. . . . . . . . . . aa ac al alao ali ap v a r i e d a d e s

. . . . . # . . . . atencao atlanta camilo e p o c a # t u l e

. # . . . . . . # . doar dr duo eam eis el r # c a m i l o # n

Your task is to develop a program to solve the described crossword puzzles.

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The input consists of a 10  10 puzzle configuration and a word dictionary. For the puzzle each
input line is a sequence of . and # characters. You may assume that the given configuration is always
correct.

The dictionary words start immediately after the last line of the puzzle. Each word is a sequence
of lower case letters, without accents and separated by spaces. The dictionary terminates when the
end-of-file is reached from the standard input.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The program should output the number of solutions that the given crossword puzzle accepts.
