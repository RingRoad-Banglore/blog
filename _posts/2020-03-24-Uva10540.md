## Input

```
A beautiful mind looks for beauty in everything. Determinant is a mathematician who finds many
beautiful flowers in intersecting circles. You can see his flowers below. The layers are marked with
different colors. You can assume that the topmost flower is the smallest and darkest. The bottom
layer(s) is(are) covered by the top layer(s). You can assume that

1. The circles intersect one another at a common point and at an uncommon point.

2. The circles are of equal radius.

3. The consecutive circles are at equal angular distance.

4. The flower in each layer has equal number of petals.

5. Assume that  = 2  cos1(0.0)

Three circles intersect Four circles intersect Six circles intersect

Eight circles intersect Ten circles intersect Fifteen circles intersect

Twenty circles intersect

Given the radius (R) and number (N) of intersecting circles, you will have to find the total area of
each layer (Li), the total visible area of each layer (Vi). Total Area of each layer means the summation
of the surface area of all the petals in that layer. For example, the petals of the bottom most layer are
always circles. So the total area of the bottom most layer is always N  area_of_one_circle.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains less than 1200 lines of input. Each line contains two positive integers R (50 
R > 0) and N (100  N  3) as described in the problem statement. Input is terminated by a line
where R = 0 and N = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input, produce L+ 2 lines of output, where L is the number of layers in that flower.

The first line of the output for each layer is the output serial number as shown in the sample output.
The very next line contains an integer L, where L is the number of layers in the flower. Each of the
next L lines should contain two floating-point numbers. The first floating point number in the i-th line
denotes the total area of the i-th layer (From top to bottom) and the second floating point number
denotes the visible area of the i-th layer. All floating-point numbers should be rounded up to four digits
after the decimal point. Errors less than 104 will be ignored.
