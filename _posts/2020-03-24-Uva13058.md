title: Uva 13058  Baking Cakes with Grandma
---


## Input

```
After five years, Eloi is visiting grandma again. She is very proud because he has, by now, mastered
the craft of sewing buttons. Eloi is about to finish his degree in math at the Academy of Colombian
Mathematicians (ACM); as a matter of fact, he just defended his dissertation about arrangements of
colored buttons.

Grandma is currently into baking cakes of all sorts and flavors. C is for cake; thats good enough
for me fresh from the oven! Well, for Eloi, C means programming contests, sleepless nights, and
humongous cups of Colombian coffee. Anyway, hes here to take a break from that and relax baking
cakes with granny.

Grandma usually bakes her cakes in baking pans which were once round, but due to carelessness and
time, now have several dents all along their border. Eloi just cant stop thinking about mathematics,
so he has realized that there is an interesting geometrical puzzle related to the cakes. Given a circular
baking pan with n dents on its border, what is the largest m such that there are m dents amongst the
n which form a regular m-gon?
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of a test
case contains an integer n (3  n < 103) indicating the number of dents in the border of the baking
pan. The second line contains n blank-separated integers a1, . . . , an (with 1  ai  105): ai indicates
the length of the arc between the ith dent and the next.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output a line with the largest m such that there are m dents amongst the n that
form a regular m-gon. If such an m does not exist, then output -1.
