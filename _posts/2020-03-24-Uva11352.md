```
King Peter lives in kingdom A, and his daughter in kingdom B. King recieved a letter telling that her
daughter gave birth to a child. King is incredibly curious to see his grandchild! Unfortunately thats
not gonna be that easy.

Kingdoms A and B are separated by a forest. There are lots of enemies in the forest, and King is
not that curious to see them. If they attack king on his way to kingdom B, then he will never ever see
his grandchild and daughter again because of lethal consequences.

Security Council of the King disposes information about location of the enemies, which makes the
things easier for king. For some unknown reason a forest is M N chessboard. (M is the number of
rows, and N is the number of columns). N,M  100 are positive integers.

Enemies of the King can ride horses as showed in the picture. Usually horses ride (or jump) that
way in Chess. Unfortunately king cant take an airplane from point A to point B because it is not
invented yet. So he moves the same way as chess-king does (refer to picture for details).

King cant move to a square X, if a horse of the enemy is on that square. While the king is moving
horses are not, but if at least one horse can reach square X in one move, then king cant move to that
square (except for the case when square X is either kingdom A or B).

You are the chief of Electronic Intelligence dapartment of kingdom A (by the way the computers
are already invented). And youre asked to find the length of the shortest route L from kingdom A to
B, as king cant wait any longer.
