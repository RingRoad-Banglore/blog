11689 Soda Surpler
Tim is an absolutely obsessive soda drinker, he
simply cannot get enough. Most annoyingly
though, he almost never has any money, so his
only obvious legal way to obtain more soda is to
take the money he gets when he recycles empty
soda bottles to buy new ones. In addition to the
empty bottles resulting from his own consumption
he sometimes find empty bottles in the street. One
day he was extra thirsty, so he actually drank so-
das until he couldn’t afford a new one.

## Input

N (N < 15) which denotes the total number of test cases. The description of each test case is given
below:

Tim’s possession at the start of the day, f < 1000 the number of empty soda bottles found during the
day, and 1 < c < 2000 the number of empty bottles required to buy a new soda.
