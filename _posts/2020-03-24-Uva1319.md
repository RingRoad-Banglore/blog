## Input

```

Let x1, x2, . . . , xm be real numbers satisfying the following conditions:

a) 1
a
 xi 


5 ;

b) x1 + x2 + . . .+ xm = b 

a for some integers a and b (a > 0).

Determine the maximum value of x
p
1 + x

p
2 + . . .+ x

p
m for some even positive integer p.
```

## Output

```
Each input line contains four integers: m, p, a, b (m  2000, p  12, p is even). Input is correct, i.e.
for each input numbers there exists x1, x2, . . . , xm satisfying the given conditions.

```
