title: Uva 01245  Pile it down
---


```

Sita and Gita are smart kids. Generally after completing their
homework they go out for some outdoor games. But its raining
today and they have to stay home. They decide to break their
piggy-bank and count their savings. They find out that they have
accumulated many coins over the last few months and decide to
play a game with these coins. First they divide the coins into 2
piles containing X and Y coins respectively.

Now they start the game by alternating turns. In each turn
a player can do one of the following:

 Remove any number of coins from a single pile.

 Remove equal number of coins from both piles.

 Pass on the turn to the next player. Note that this still
counts as a turn.

The game ends when no move is possible and the player who
cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally. Being smart, both players calculate the outcome
of the game before the game begins. The player who loses tries to maximize the number of turns in the
game and player who wins tries to minimize the turns. No player can pass more than P times. Sita
starts the game.
