Nuclear power plants (NPP) are a blessing and curse of modern civilization. NPPs have some risks but
still it is one of the cheapest ways to produce electricity in the developed world. In this problem we
will discuss a situation related to two nuclear plants, which are not far away from each other.

Figure 1: Two Nuclear Power Plants. Houses at (81, 49) and (77,33) are at high risk from both the
plants.

We will describe the entire scenario in a flat land, so two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system
is used to denote each location. Lets assume that the coordinate of the two nuclear power plants
are (ax, ay) and (bx, by). Houses that are located within distance R1 (inclusive) of the power plant
at (ax, ay) are under high risk of radiation. Similarly, houses that are located within distance R2
(inclusive) of the power plant at (bx, by) are under high risk of radiation. So the authorities of power
plant 1 and power plant 2 distribute special protective equipments to the houses that are within radius
(inclusive) R1 and R2 of the respective power plants. As a result each of the houses that are endangered
by both the plants actually receive two sets of equipments to protect their house, however only one set
is enough for full protection. Houses that are outside the high-risk area are under low risk of radiation
but they do not receive any protective equipment due to budget constraints. However, each owner of
the houses that have two sets of protective equipments gives away one set of equipment to the owner of
a house that has none. Still, some houses in the low-risk area remain un-protected. Given the location
of the houses and the values of ax, ay, bx, by and possible values of R1 and R2 your job is to find out
the number of houses that are without protective equipments for each pair of values of R1 and R2.

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 3 test cases. The description of each test case is given below:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12537  Radiation 2/2

A test case starts with a line containing a positive integer N (0 < N  200000) that denotes
the number of houses that are under either low risk or high risk of radiation. Each of the next N
lines contains two integers xi, yi (0  xi, yi  20000) that denotes the coordinate of the i-th house.
No two houses are at the same location. The next line contains five integers ax, ay, bx, by and q
(0  ax, ay, bx, by  20000, 0 < q  20000). The meaning of ax, ay, bx and by are given in the problem
statement. Here q denotes the total number of query. Each of the next q lines contains two integers,
which denote the values of R1 and R2 (0 < R1, R2  13000) respectively.

A line containing a single zero terminates input. This line should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case produce q + 1 lines of output. The first line is the serial of output. For each query
(given value of R1 and R2) determine how many houses in the low risk region remains without protective
equipment. You may consider using faster IO as judge input file is large.

Note: First query in the sample input corresponds to Figure 1.
