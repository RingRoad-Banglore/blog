title: Uva 00838  Worm World
---


## Input

```
The WormWold puzzle was initially proposed by Cliff Pick-
over in the Discover Magazine, issue of November 1994 (a
visit to his home page is highly recommended!). The Worm-
World is a grid of numbers and it is a tough place to live in.
The worms that inhabit it are all born with nasty allergies.
The first time they come in contact with a number, their
immune systems are overstimulated; if they are exposed to
that number a second time, they die of anaphylactic shock.

A worm can start crawling on any square in Worm-
World, and it can then move horizontally or vertically but
not diagonally. In this scenario, what is the longest path a
worm can take without dying? An example is illustrated in
the following figure.

Write a program that determines the largest path a
worm can take for a given grid.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first input line is the size N of the grid (0 < N  12). This is followed by N input lines, each
one with N positive integer values separated by blank spaces (as a simplification, we will only use grid
values less then 1000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The output is the size (in terms of the number of squares) of the largest path that a worm can take.
