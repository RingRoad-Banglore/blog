title: Uva 11928  The Busy Dog
---


## Input

```text
Rex is a very lucky dog. His owner Stan is very dili-
gent about taking him out for a walk in the park every
day. Midway through these walks, Stan takes a break
and ties Rex to a pole so he can sit down on a bench
for a few minutes.

Rex is also a very busy dog. When he is tied to
this pole, he still likes to run around to look at var-
ious curiosities. This often causes his leash to wrap
around the pole quite a few times. Once Stans break
is done, he calls Rex back to the bench and then un-
ties his leash. Stan likes to pull the leash tight around
the pole, and then see how many times the leash is
wrapped around and in which direction.

You will be given the description of the path that
Rex follows when he is tied around the pole. For
simplicity, this path will be given as a sequence of
straight line segments. Remember that Rex always
returns to Stan before being untied; this final segment
is not explicitly included in the description.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n between 1 and 10,000 describing the number
of line segments. The next line consists of two integers x, y which describe the location of the pole.
Then n lines follow, where the i-th such line consists of two integers xi, yi between -10,000 and 10,000.
This means that Rex starts at x1, y1 and visits the points in the following manner: after visiting a point
xi, yi Rex immediately runs in a straight line to point xi+1, yi+1 for 1  i  n1. Finally, after visiting
the final point xn, yn, Rex runs in a straight line to the starting point x1, y1.

Input is terminated by a line containing 0 which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case you are to output a single line consisting of the number of times the leash winds
around the pole after Rexs run. Recall that the leash is pulled taught in the direction of Rexs final
position after he is done running and you may assume that no knots were formed in this process. If the
number of times is k > 0, then output +k if the leash is wrapped counter-clockwise around the pole,
or output k if the leash is wrapped clockwise around the pole. If k = 0, then simply output 0.

Finally, it may be that Rex actually ran into the pole during his run. If this happens, then you
should simply output Ouch! instead of a number. You can assume the pole is infinitesimally skinny
which means that we say Rex runs into the pole if Rex occupies the position x, y at any time during
the run.
