title: Uva 10681  Teobaldos Trip
---


```
Teobaldo works for the Brazilian government. In his job, he travels a lot. When Teolbaldo travels from
a city S to a city E he can spend up to D days in the trip.

As Teobaldo doesnt like to work, he always spend the maximum number of days in his trips. In
each day of his trip, Teobaldo sleeps in a different city from the previous day, because he thinks it is
boring to stay in the same city two consecutive days.

In this problem, you should help Teobaldo to schedule his trips.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several input sets. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with two integers C (0 < C  100), the number of cities, and L (0  L  500),
the number of links between the cities. Follow L lines, where each line has two numbers: A and B
(1  A,B  C), meaning there is a link between these two cities. You can assume that A and B are
different numbers. After the L lines, there are three integers: S, E and D. Where S is the city where
the trip must start, E is the city where the trip must end, and D (0  D  200) is the maximum
number of days for Teobaldo to go from S to E.

Input is terminated by a set where C = L = 0. This set should not be processed. There is a blank
line beteween two input sets.
