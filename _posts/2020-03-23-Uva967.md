967 Circular

A circular prime is a prime number that remains prime as each leftmost digit (most significant digit),
in turn, is moved to the right hand side. For instance, the number 19937 is a circular prime, since all
numbers in the sequence 19937, 99371, 93719, 37199 and 71993 are prime numbers. Your objective is
to write a program that, given a range, computes the number of circular primes in that range.

## Input

The input consists of a sequence of pairs of integers i and j, with one pair of integers per input line.
All integers will be less than 1,000,000 and greater or equal to 100. You can assume that in any pair
i is lesser or equal than j. You should process all pairs of integers, and for each such pair, count the
number of circular primes between i and j, including i and j. Input is terminated by a line just with
the number ‘-1’.

## Output

For each pair of input integers, defining a range, the output should be: ‘No Circular Primes.’ (if
there are no circular primes in the range), ‘1 Circular Prime.’ (if only one circular prime exists in
the range), or ‘n Circular Primes.’ (if there are n circular primes in the range, and n is greater than
one).

## Sample Input
<p></p><p>1000 1100</p><p></p><p>100 120</p><p></p><p>100 1000</p><p></p><p>-1</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p></p><p>No Circular Primes.</p><p></p><p>1 Circular Prime.</p><p></p><p>12 Circular Primes.</p>
