What do researchers working at ICPC (Institute for Cryptographic Programming and Computing) do
for fun? Well, as you probably have expected, in addition to solving algorithm-related problems on
online judges, they also like to toy with various cryptographic schemes. Recently one of the researchers,
Tom, has become interested in RSA algorithm implementations used in handheld devices.

Note that the description of the general RSA algorithm is as follows:

1) Choose two distinct prime numbers p and q, and let n = pq;

2) Choose an integer e such that gcd(e, (p 1)(q  1) = 1;

3) Compute the integer d that satisfies the congruence relation de  1(mod(p 1)(q  1)).

Then, if person A wants to give person B a way to send an encrypted message to him, A can follow
the above steps and release (n, e) as his public key. Upon receiving As public key, B can simply encrypt
message x (0  x < n) by computing y = xe mod n. This would result in a message which ideally only
A could decrypt with his private key d: x = yd mod n.

As the computation power of handheld devices is usually limited, a relatively small e is usually used
to encrypt data. However this can lead to great security risks. For example, it is quite simple to recover
p and q (i.e., factor n) when you have both the public key (n, e) and the private key d. Could you help
Tom write a program to demonstrate this?
```

## Input

```
There are multiple test cases in the input file.
Each test case contains three integers, n, d, and e (n  10100, 3  e  31). All three integers are

given without any preceding zeros. It is guaranteed that all numbers satisfy the condition as given in
the problem statement.

Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with n = 0, d = 0 and e = 0
indicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, please print two prime numbers, p and q, such that n = pq and p < q, in the format
as illustrated below.
