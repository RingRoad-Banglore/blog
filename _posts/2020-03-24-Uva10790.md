title: Uva 10790  How Many Points of Intersection
---


```
We have two rows. There are a dots on the top row and b dots on the bottom row. We draw line segments
connecting every dot on the top row with every dot on the bottom row. The dots are arranged in such
a way that the number of internal intersections among the line segments is maximized. To achieve this
goal we must not allow more than two line segments to intersect in a point. The intersection points on
the top row and the bottom are not included in our count; we can allow more than two line segments
to intersect on those two rows. Given the value of a and b, your task is to compute P (a, b), the number
of intersections in between the two rows. For example, in the following figure a = 2 and b = 3. This
figure illustrates that P (2, 3) = 3.
```

## Input

```
Each line in the input will contain two positive integers a (0 < a  20000) and b (0 < b  20000).
Input is terminated by a line where both a and b are zero. This case should not be processed. You will
need to process at most 1200 sets of inputs.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input, print in a line the serial of output followed by the value of P (a, b). Look at the
output for sample input for details. You can assume that the output for the test cases will fit in 64-bit
signed integers.
