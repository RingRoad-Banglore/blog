title: Uva 11862  Airbus vs Boeing
---


## Input

```
Airbus & Boeing are the two giant names in the air-
craft manufacturing industry of today. Both of these
reputed companies have a number of distinguished
aircrafts. Due to the competitive nature of the mar-
ket, comparisons have been made between different
aircraft models and very often a certain aircraft from
Airbus has been termed similar to some Boeing air-
craft model. For example, Boeing 737 has historically
been linked with Airbus A320 as the same category
aircraft. To make things more complicated, the rela-
tionships are not always one to one. The recent Boe-
ing 787-9 DreamLiners are very well compared with
both Airbus A340-500 as well as Airbus A350-800.
There are many other such cases.

In your first day of work at So Many Problems Airport, the airport manager hands you over a
list containing a number of aircraft pairs. At first observation you realize that the list can essentially
be modeled as a graph where an edge between two aircraft models means that these two aircrafts are
manufactured by different companies but are similar to each other. You have also noticed that, the
graph never has a cycle. On the other hand, you have found that the list has a major flaw. In this list,
the aircrafts are mentioned only using the model numbers but the manufacturer names are omitted.
So, the fact that Boeing 747-8 is similar to Airbus A380, is stated as 747-8 A380 in the list.

What you are trying to do is to divide all the aircrafts from the input list into two sublists - one
per each manufacturer. Moreover, each of the lists will have to be in sorted order i.e. if there are two
aircrafts in a sublist, the better aircraft between them should be ranked higher in the sublist. Now, you
are not given any input about which aircraft is better than whichever other aircraft. Also, you have no
idea about which models are Airbus models while which are Boeing models. Naturally, you can create
the two sorted sublists in many possible way and still you wont know which one is the right one. By
this time, you have begun to doubt that some of the given similarity reports might not be valid at
all. For example, if your final sorted sublists are [A,B] and [C,D] and your input list shows that A is
similar to D and B is similar to C  clearly one of these two similarities are wrong.

The first thing you are trying to find is, given the input similarities, at most how many of them
might be valid for any configuration of the two input sublists.

## Output

```
There will be at most 60 test cases in the input file. Each case begins with an integer N (1  N  100),
the number of different aircraft models in the list. Each of the next N lines contain a unique string, the
name of an aircraft model. This string will be upto 10 characters and will contain upper case letter and
digits only. Then follows an integer E (E  0), the number of similarities in the list. Each similarity is
described in a line by a pair of aircraft model names separated by a space. Each line denotes that the
pair of aircrafts in that line are created by two separate manufacturers and are similar to each other.
There will be no invalid model names.

The end of input will be denoted by a case with N = 0. This case should not be processed.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a line in the format, Case X: Y , where X is the case number and Y is the
maximum possible number of valid similarities in the input list.

Explanation of sample input:
In the first sample, the 7 aircraft models can be divided into two sorted lists with keeping all the

6 similarities consistent. For example, suppose one of the list is [A380, A340] (in given order) and the
other list is [747, 787, 777, 757, 767] (in given order). Now, if we draw lines from aircrafts of left list to
its similar aircrafts from right list, there will be no crossing.

But in the second sample, no matter how we divide and sort the input list, there will be at least one
inconsistent similarity. Lets assume our sorted lists are [747, 777, 757, 737] and [A380, A340, A320].
Then we can see that, in the left list, 777 is a higher rank aircraft than 757 while A340 is a higher rank
aircraft than A320. But in our input list, 777 is linked with A320 while 757 with A340. Clearly, one of
these two similarities must be invalid. If you check other possible combinations for the two lists, you
will find that there are one or more invalid similarities. So, the maximum number of valid similarities
is 6 1 = 5.
