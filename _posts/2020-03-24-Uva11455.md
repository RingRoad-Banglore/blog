Any square is a rectangle, any rectangle is a quadrangle, and any quadrangle is composed of four sides.
But not all rectangles are squares, not all quadrangles are rectangles, and not all sets of four sides are
quadrangles.

We have the length of four sides. You have to determine if they can form a square. If not, determine
if they can form a rectangle. If not, determine if they can form a quadrangle.
