title: Uva 11782  Optimal Cut
---


## Input

```
A cut of a binary tree is a set of tree nodes such as for each possible path from the root node to any
leaf node, just one node in the cut belongs to the path. In a weighted binary tree, one can compute a
weighted cut, because it would include weighted nodes. The total weight of such cut can be computed
by adding up the weights of the nodes in it. The figure below shows a weighted binary tree. The gray
nodes represent a weighted cut, and its total weight is 14.

Now, given a weighted binary tree, you have to write a program that finds the weighted cut with
the maximal total weight value among all possible weighted cuts in the tree. This is hereafter called
the Optimal Cut of the input binary tree. However, to make it a bit more interesting, your program
must find the optimal cut that includes no more than K nodes, and report its weight. In the figure
above, for instance, the nodes of the optimal cut sums 28 when K = 3, and 15 when K = 2.
```

## Output

```
The input can contain several problems. Each problem contains the description of a complete binary
tree in a single line. This description corresponds to sequence of integer numbers, separated of each
other by a blank space. The description starts with an integer 0  H < 20 representing the height of
the tree, followed by another integer 1  K  20 representing the maximum number of nodes in the
optimal cut to be found. Then, the weights 103  Wi  103 of the nodes follow, listed in pre-order.
The end of input is indicated by a single line containing only an integer value of -1.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each problem in the input, the output should be a single line with a single integer number, repre-
senting the total weight of the optimal cut found.
