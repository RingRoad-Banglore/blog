title: Uva 11728  Alternate Task
---


```
Little Hasan loves to play number games with his friends. One day they were playing a game where
one of them will speak out a positive number and the others have to tell the sum of its factors. The
first one to say it correctly wins. After a while they got bored and wanted to try out a different game.
Hassan then suggested about trying the reverse. That is, given a positive number S, they have to find
a number whose factors add up to S. Realizing that this task is tougher than the original task, Hasan
came to you for help. Luckily Hasan owns a portable programmable device and you have decided to
burn a program to this device. Given the value of S as input to the program, it will output a number
whose sum of factors equal to S.
```

## Input

```
Each case of input will consist of a positive integer S  1000. The last case is followed by a value of 0.

```

## Output

```
For each case of input, there will be one line of output. It will be a positive integer whose sum of factors
is equal to S. If there is more than one such integer, output the largest. If no such number exists,
output -1. Adhere to the format shown in sample output.

```

## Sample Input

```
1
102
1000
0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 1
Case 2: 101
Case 3: -1
```
