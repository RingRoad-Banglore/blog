title: Uva 11681  Towers for Mobile Telephony
---


```
A new telephony company intends to offer services of residential telephone in your city. The phones
will be residential, but the company will use mobile tecnology, with transmitter towers, to avoid the
expenses of building a cable network throughout the city.

The power of the equipment installed in a tower defines the towers cover radius (which, in turn,
defines the cover area of the tower, since the city is perfeclty flat). The cost of the equipment installed
in each tower is directly proportional to its power, and therefore to its cover radius.

The company decided that exactly two towers will be used. The same type of equipment will be
installed in both towers; that is, both towers will have the same cover radius. Since the company
wants to offer its services to all homes in the city, the cover radius of both towers, together, must cover
all homes. Additionally, to minimize the cost, the cover radius of the towers must be the minimum
possible. The figure below shows two possible configurations of cover radius for the two towers in a city
with ten homes. Both (a) and (b) cover all homes, but (b) is the one that uses the minimum possible
cover radius.

Given the position of each home in the city, you must write a program to determine the smallest
cover radius for the towers, so that all homes in the city are covered.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by two lines. The first line of a test
case contains an integer N , the number of homes in the city (3  N  40). Each of the following
N lines contains two integers X and Y , separated by a single space (0  X  104 e 0  Y  104),
representing the position of a home. Each home has a different position.

The end of input is indicated by a line containing only one zero.

```

## Output

```
For each test case in the input your program must print a single line, containing a real number, written
with a precision of two decimal places, indicating the smallest cover radius to be used in both towers.
