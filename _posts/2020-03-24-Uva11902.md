title: Uva 11902  Dominator
---


```
In graph theory, a node X dominates a node Y if every path
from the predefined start node to Y must go through X. If Y
is not reachable from the start node then node Y does not have
any dominator. By definition, every node reachable from the
start node dominates itself. In this problem, you will be given a
directed graph and you have to find the dominators of every node
where the 0-th node is the start node.

As an example, for the graph shown right, 3 dominates 4 since
all the paths from 0 to 4 must pass through 3. 1 doesnt dominate
3 since there is a path 0-2-3 that doesnt include 1.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input will contain T ( 100) denoting the number
of cases.

Each case starts with an integer N (0 < N < 100) that rep-
resents the number of nodes in the graph. The next N lines contain N integers each. If the j-th (0
based) integer of i-th (0 based) line is 1, it means that there is an edge from node i to node j and
similarly a 0 means there is no edge.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the case number first. Then output 2N +1 lines that summarizes the dominator
relationship between every pair of nodes. If node A dominates node B, output Y in cell (A,B),
otherwise output N. Cell (A,B) means cell at A-th row and B-th column. Surround the output with
|, + and - to make it more legible. Look at the samples for exact format.
