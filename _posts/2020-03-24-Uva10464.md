title: Uva 10464  Big Big Real Numbers
---


## Input

```text
Aztec warriors are very good at math (Sssh! Its a secret information :). As an Aztec, little Ahuitzotl
has his hearts wish to be a great warrior. But he is not good at math. There is a tradition in Aztecs
that foundation of being very good at math is to know how to add really big decimal point numbers.
With this wish in his heart, little Ahuitzotl started to practice adding such big real numbers. He wants
your help to become very good at math. He wants you to write a program for him so that when he
adds two decimal numbers he can match his results with your programs output. You see, you have such
a big responsibility (to help a kid being a great warrior :)
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input is a non negative integer N . Next N line follows a pair of real numbers separated
by a space in each line. Negative real number can appear in the input. Length of each number can
be 1000 digits both before and after decimal point. The Input ends at EOF. You can assume that no
invalid number will be given as input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
You have to print the result after adding every pair of numbers in different lines. There should be at
least one digit after and before the decimal point and no trailing and leading zeros should be printed.

```
