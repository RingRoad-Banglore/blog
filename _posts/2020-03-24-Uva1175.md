title: Uva 01175  Ladies Choice
---


```
Teenagers from the local high school have asked you to help them with the organization of next years
Prom. The idea is to find a suitable date for everyone in the class in a fair and civilized way. So,
they have organized a web site where all students, boys and girls, state their preferences among the
class members, by ordering all the possible candidates. Your mission is to keep everyone as happy as
possible. Assume that there are equal numbers of boys and girls.

Given a set of preferences, set up the blind dates such that there are no other two people of opposite
sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners. Since it was decided that the
Prom was Ladies Choice, we want to produce the best possible choice for the girls.
