title: Uva 13271  Brick  Walls
---


## Input

```text
You have to lead a pack of ants in search of
food. The ants have to march through a rather
large brick wall. They need to ensure that they
are not on the surface of the bricks as it gets
easier for mean people to crush them. If they
can travel through the valleys, it would be much 
 harder  to  kill  them.

The bricks are laid out in a regular grid like
pattern (as shown in the figure). Each brick is
a rectangle that is  2  units long horizontally and
1 unit long vertically. There are tiny gaps (val-
leys) in between two bricks (both horizontally 
 and  vertically).

The ants are to start at a point in the valley,
and their destination is a point in the valley as well. As the bricks are of fixed size and are following a
regular pattern with gaps, these points can always be represented  by  integer  coordinates.

Your  task  is  to  find  the  distance  of  the  shortest  path  from  the  starting  point  to  the  destination 
 point.
```

## Output

```text
There can be at most  1000 test cases. Each test case consists of four integers giving the values of
starting row  Sr , starting column  Sc , destination row  Dr , destination column  Dc . You can assume
that 1  Sr, Sc, Dr, Dc  10 9 . The last line of input will be 0 0 0 0  this line must not be processed
as a test  case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For  each  test  case  print  the  distance  of  the  shortest  path  in  a  single  line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1 7 2 7
5 4 3 2
2 3 3 6
0 0 0 0

```
