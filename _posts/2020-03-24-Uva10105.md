title: Uva 10105  Polynomial coefficients
---


## Input

```text
The problem is to calculate the coefficients in expansion of polynomial (x1 + x2 + . . .+ xk)n.
```

## Output

```text
The input will consist of a set of pairs of lines. The first line of the pair consists of two integers n and
k separated with space (0 < K,N < 13). This integers define the power of the polynomial and the
amount of the variables. The second line in each pair consists of k non-negative integers n1, . . . , nk,
where n1 + . . .+ nk = n.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input pair of lines the output line should consist one integer, the coefficient by the monomial
xn11 x

n2
2 . . . x

nk
k in expansion of the polynomial (x1 + x2 + . . .+ xk)

n.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2 2
1 1
2 12
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
