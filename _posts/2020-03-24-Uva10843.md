A little girl whose name is Anne Spetring likes to play the following game. She draws a circle on
paper. Then she draws another one and connects it to the first cicrle by a line. Then she draws another
and connects it to one of the first two circles by a line. She continues this way until she has n circles
drawn and each one connected to one of the previously drawn circles. Her circles never intersect and
lines never cross. Finally, she numbers the circles from 1 to n in some random order.

How many different pictures can she draw that contain exactly n circles? Two pictures are different
if one of them has a line connecting circle number i to circle number j, and the other picture does not.
