title: Uva 12217  Integer Game
---


```
You are playing a single player game where you can convert one integer from another through a sequence
of moves. The integer Y is reachable from X in a single move if the following is satisfied.

Y =
X  P k2

P k1

where k is a positive integer, P1 and P2 are prime numbers and X is divisible P k1 .
For example 18 is reachable from 8 in one move, because you can divide 8 by 4 and then multiply

by 9. But 6 is not reachable from 8. Given two integers A and B calculate the minimum number of
moves necessary to transform A into B. Both A and B can be very large. So each of them is needed
to be expressed as a multiplication of a sequence of small integers: A =

N
i=1 a1 and B =

M
i=1 b1

Both of the sequences ai and bi will be given as inputs.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input contains T (1  T  40) the number of test cases. Then T blocks of test cases
follows. First line of the test case contains N (1  N  300) followed by N integers. N is the length
of the sequence ai and the following N integers form the sequence ai. The second line starts with an
integer M (1  M  300). M is the length of the sequence bi and the following M integers form the
sequence bi. Each of integers in these two sequences will be between 2 and 200 (inclusive).

```

## Output

```
For each case of input, print the serial of output followed by an integer: the minimum number of moves
required to transform A to B. If it is impossible to transform A to B with any number of moves output
-1 instead. If the minimum number of moves is greater than or equal to 20 print a -1 as well.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
1 4
1 9
2 2 2
2 3 3
1 8
1 6
2 32 11
3 27 25 13

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 1
Case 2: 1
Case 3: -1
Case 4: 3
```
