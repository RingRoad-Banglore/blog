title: Uva 11246  KMultiple Free Set
---


```
A k-multiple free set is a set of integers where there is no pair of integers where one is equal to another
integer multiplied by k. For example for k = 2, {1,3,4} is a valid set, but not {2,4,5}, as 4 is double of
2.

You will be given n and k. you have to determine the largest k-multiple free subset of the integers
from 1 to n.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input contains T (1  T  1000) the number of test case. Then following lines
contains T test cases. Each case contains a line containing 2 integers n (1  n  1000000000) and k
(2  k  100).

```

## Output

```
For each test case output contains 1 integer the size of the largest k-multiple free subset of the integers
from 1 to n.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
10 2
100 2
1000 2

```

## Sample Output

```
6
67
666
