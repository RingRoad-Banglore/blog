```

Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu were famous strategists in The Three Kingdoms Period. During The War
of the Red Cliff in which Cao Chao was defeated, they often sat together to play chess. But the chess
they played was special.

We can call the chess Three Kingdom Chess. There are 2 players, and each one has some soldiers.
All the soldiers are put on an N M chessboard. Each grid on the chess board can be mountain, plain
or lake. And there are 3 kinds of soldiers which are footman, archer and rider. All kind of soldiers can
stay at or pass through plains. None of them can stay at or pass through lakes. Only footmen and
archers can stay at or pass through mountains.

There are at most K turns in the game. Two players take turns to act. The first turn is Zhuge
Liangs turn, the second turn is Zhou Yus, the third turn is Zhuge Liangs. . .and so on. When one
players soldiers are all destroyed or after the Kth turn, the game ends. In each turn, the player can
move one of his soldiers to a destination and then let it attack one of the opponents soldiers.

The rule of moving is as below. Every kind of soldiers has its pace length. A soldier with pace
length of q can move at most q steps(you can also let your soldier move 0 step). On each step, a soldier
can move up, down, left or right by one grid. But please note that no soldier can pass a lake and a rider
cant pass a mountain, as mentioned above. A soldier is also not able to pass a grid which is occupied
by an enemy soldier. A soldier can pass, but cannot stay at a grid which is occupied by his comrade.

After a soldier reaching his moving destination, he can launch an attack. A soldier can attack an
enemy soldier who is in his attack region. The attack regions of different kinds of soldiers are shown
in the figures below:

It means that the soldier in the grid with a circle can attack one enemy soldier who is in the black
grids.

Every soldier has a strength property. A soldiers strength will decrease if he is attacked. The
strength decrement equals to [S  F ], which S is the attackers strength, and F is the attacking factor.
The attacking factor is 2 when a footman attacks an archer, an archer attacks a rider and a rider attacks
a footman. Its 1 when a footman attacks a footman, a rider attacks a rider and an archer attacks an
archer. Its 0.5 when a footman attacks a rider, a rider attacks an archer and an archer attacks a
footman.

A soldier will be destroyed and disappear if its strengths is equal to or less than 0.

In one turn, a soldier can only launch one attack, and he cant move again in the same turn after
attacking.

At the end, the score you get is the sum of strength of all your soldiers minus the sum of strengths
of all your opponents soldiers. So the score can be negative. Suppose Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu were

both very clever and always chose the best strategy to get as many score as possible, so whats the
maximum score could Zhuge Liang get in the game?

## Input

```
There are several test cases. For each test case:
The first line contains 3 integers, N , M (1  N,M  5) and K (1  K  10), indicating that the

chessboard is N M , and the game will end after K turns.
Then N lines follow, each containing M integers. Every integer represents a grid, showing the grids

property. 0 stands for plain, 1 stands for mountain and 2 stands for lake.
The next line contains 4 integers, T (1  T  6), S1, S2 and S3, indicating that there are T soldiers

on the chessboard at the beginning. It is guaranteed that no more than one soldier stay at the same
grid. S1, S2 and S3 mean the pace length of footman, rider and archer.

For the next T lines, each line contains 5 integers x, y, a, b and c, describing a soldier. The soldier
is in row x and column y (The coordinates x, y start from 1). If a = 0 then the soldier is Zhuge Liangs
and if a = 1 then it is Zhouyus. The strength of the soldier is b. c = 0 means the soldier is a footman,
c = 1 means it is a rider and c = 2 means it is an archer.

The input ends with N = M = K = 0.
