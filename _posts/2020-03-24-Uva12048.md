## Input

```
The kingdom of Geometry Land is huge and the number of people living here is also huge. One day,
The King wanted to find how many people living in this kingdom. So, he asked all the inhabitants of
the kingdom to stay in the kingdom for one day.

The kingdom can be modeled in a 2D plane as a convex polygon. The King sent many messengers
to find all the people they can find. The messengers were not good at geometry, so, they noted the
positions of the people as 2D co-ordinates using GPS.

Now you are given the map and the positions of the people of the kingdom. You have to find whether
a person belongs to the kingdom or not. You can safely assume that the person is an inhabitant of the
kingdom if and only if his position is inside the kingdom. If a person lies in the boundary of the map,
you can consider him inside.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer T (T  10) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

Each case starts with a blank line and an integer n (3  n  105), denoting the number of vertices
of the convex polygon that form the kingdom. Each of the next n lines will contain two integers: xi
yi (105  xi, yi  105) denoting the i-th vertex of the polygon. The vertices will be given in anti-
clockwise order.

The next line will contain an integer Q (1  Q  10000) denoting the number of positions reported
by the messengers. Each of the next Q lines will contain two integers: xi yi (105  xi, yi  105)
denoting the position of the i-th person.

```

## Sample Input

For each reported person, print y or n in a single line depending whether the person is an inhabitant
or not.
