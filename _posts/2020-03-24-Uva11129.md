title: Uva 11129  An antiarithmetic permutation
---


## Input

```
A permutation of n+1 is a bijective function of
the initial n+ 1 natural numbers: 0, 1, . . . n. A
permutation p is called antiarithmetic if there is
no subsequence of it forming an arithmetic pro-
gression of length bigger than 2, i.e. there are
no three indices 0  i < j < k < n such that
(pi, pj , pk) forms an arithmetic progression.

For example, the sequence (2, 0, 1, 4, 3) is an antiarithmetic permutation of 5. The sequence (0, 5,
4, 3, 1, 2) is not an antiarithmetic permutation of 6 as its first, fifth and sixth term (0, 1, 2) form an
arithmetic progression; and so do its second, fourth and fifth term (5, 3, 1).

Your task is to generate an antiarithmetic permutation of n.

## Output

```
Each line of the input file contains a natural number 3  n  10000. The last line of input contains 0
marking the end of input.
