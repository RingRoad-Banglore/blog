title: Uva 11785  Hypercube
---


## Input

```
In geometry, a hypercube is an n-dimensional analogue of a square (n = 2) and a cube (n = 3). It
consists in groups of opposite parallel line segments aligned in each of the spaces dimensions, at right
angles to each other and of the same length. An n-dimensional hypercube is also called an n-cube.

In parallel computing, the vertexes are processors, and the line segments (edges) represent connec-
tions. The n-cube architecture has the following properties:

 Each node has n connections with different processors.

 Each processor has a unique identifier, between 0 and 2n  1.

 Two processors are directly connected if and only if their identifiers differ in just one bit. For
instance, in a 3-cube, processors 3 (011 in binary) and 7 (111 in binary) are directly connected.

 The number of processors is 2n

The new company WEFAIL is designing hypercubes, but they are always contracting new people,
whose do not know all the hypercube properties, and sometimes they fail; thus these properties are
not satisfied in all cases. Given an arbitrary graph, your task is to write a program that determines
whether the graph is a hypercube or not.
```

## Output

```
The input consists in several problem instances. Each instance contains one graph, which starts with
a line with two positive integers: K and M , representing the number of vertexes (0 < K  1024) and
the number of edges respectively. It follows (0  M  5130) lines, representing the edges. Each edge
is given by two 32 bits integers, representing the processors connected by the edge.

The end of input is indicated by a test case with K = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each problem instance, the output is a single line, with the word YES if the corresponding graph is
a hypercube, and NO otherwise (quotes for clarity). The output must be written to standard output.
