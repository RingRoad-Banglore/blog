title: Uva 00363  Approximate Matches
---


## Input

```
Given a non-null string of text S, a non-null string of text P , and an integer k  0, find all non-null
substrings of S that match or approximately match P with at most k mismatches. The substring
S1 is considered to match the string P if they are identical (as you might expect), and approximately
match if the strings differ by no more than k mismatches, as defined next.

If a minimum of m characters have to be removed from S1 to make it identical to P , then S1
approximately matches P with m mismatches. If a minimum of n characters have to be removed from
P to make it identical to S1, then S1 approximately matches P with n mismatches. If m characters
have to be removed from S1 and n characters have to be removed from P to make S1 and P identical,
then S1 approximately matches P with m+ n mismatches (here m+ n should be minimized).

Consider the string S = The sky is blue.

 The substring The sky in S matches the string The sky.

 The substring The sky in S approximately matches the string The skye with one mismatch
(the extra e in the string).)

 The substring sky is in S approximately matches the string skis with two mismatches (the
characters y and   in the substring).

 The substring sky is in S approximately matches the string tennis with eight mismatches
(four characters are removed from sky is and four are removed from tennis).

As another example, the string scrapple approximately matches the string apples with four
mismatches (by removing s, c, r from scrapple and s from apples). Although there are other
ways to remove letters from these two strings to make the results identical (for example removing all
but the s from both strings), four characters is the minimum number that can be removed.

Note that case is important in this problem; thus T does not match t, but T approximately matches
t with two mismatches.
```

## Output

```
Each data set consists of three lines that contain k, S, and P , respectively. k is an integer; S is a string
of length between 1 and 50 inclusive, and P is a string of length between 1 and 20 inclusive. Your
program must stop processing data when it encounters a negative value for k

```

## Sample Input

```
For each match with i mismatches (0  i  k), your program must generate a line of one of the following
forms (whichever is appropriate):

Q matches P
Q matches P with 1 mismatch
Q matches P with i mismatches

where Q is a substring of S that matches P or that approximately matches P with i mismatches. If
more than one substring in S matches or approximately matches P , they must be printed in the order
they appear in S (from left to right). Substrings that start at the same position must be listed in the
order of their size (shortest to longest). No value for Q may be listed more than once. If there is no

match, no output should be generated. Leave a blank line after the output for each data set (even if
there is no output for the data set).
