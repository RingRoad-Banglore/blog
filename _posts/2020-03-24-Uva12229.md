title: Uva 12229  Box Relations
---


## Input

```text
There are n boxes C1, C2, . . . , Cn in 3D space. The edges of the boxes are parallel to the x, y or z-axis.
We provide some relations of the boxes, and your task is to construct a set of boxes satisfying all these
relations.

There are four kinds of relations (1  i,j  n, i is different from j):

 I i j: The intersection volume of Ci and Cj is positive.

 X i j: The intersection volume is zero, and any point inside Ci has smaller x-coordinate than any
point inside Cj .

 Y i j: The intersection volume is zero, and any point inside Ci has smaller y-coordinate than any
point inside Cj .

 Z i j: The intersection volume is zero, and any point inside Ci has smaller z-coordinate than any
point inside Cj .
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 30 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers n (1  n 
1, 000) and R (0  R  100, 000), the number of boxes and the number of relations. Each of the
following R lines describes a relation, written in the format above. The last test case is followed by
n = R = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and either the word POSSIBLE or IMPOSSIBLE. If its possible
to construct the set of boxes, the i-th line of the following n lines contains six integers x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2,
that means the i-th box is the set of points (x, y, z) satisfying x1  x  x2, y1  y  y2, z1  z  z2.
The absolute values of x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 should not exceed 1,000,000.

Print a blank line after the output of each test case.
