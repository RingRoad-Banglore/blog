## Input

```text
Today is Tillibys 9-th birthday. He has been receiving all kinds of gifts
from people like glow-in-the-dark stickers, electronic calculator, a new tooth-
brush and so forth. However, this funny looking puzzle involving domino tiles
caught his attention. The rules were as follows  the puzzle consisted of a
rectangular grid of R-by-C cells, and it must be completely filled by 2  1
sized tiles, of which there is sufficient supply. No two tiles may overlap. To
complicate things even more, certain cells of the grid is marked unusable,
which must not be covered by any of the tiles. All other cells, however, must be covered by exactly one
tile. Now in spite of all these complications, this was an easy exercise for Tilliby. However, when it
came to counting the number of ways this can be solved, even his new and shiny calculator could not
help him. Can you?
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of at most 100 test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing 3 integers, R,
C and N . This line will be followed by N other lines, each containing two integers, ri and ci, where ri
is the row position of the i-th unusable cell and ci is the column position. All these input integers will
be within the following ranges: 1  R  4, 1  C  100000000, 0  N  100, 0  ri < R, 0  ci < C.

The last test case will be followed by a single line containing three 0 (zeroes) which should not be
processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output for each test case should consist of one single line of the form Case c: x, where c is the
serial number of the test case starting from 1, and x is the number of ways the specified tiling can be
performed. Since this number can be very large, output its value in mod10000007.
