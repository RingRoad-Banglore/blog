title: Uva 12155  ASCII Diamond
---


## Input

```
ASCII diamonds can be drawn with integer side lengths. Each layer of this diamond is drawn with a
single ASCII alphabet, starting with a and ending with z (starting from the center) and continues
in cyclic order.

Figure 1: ASCII diamond for different side lengths.

Any one of these ASCII diamonds can be used to draw an infinite plane by using this as a tile. For
example ASCII diamond of length 5 can be used to draw such an infinite grid. Only first 20 row and
60 columns are shown below:

Here rows and columns are numbered starting from zero. By specifying the topmost row (row1),
leftmost column (col1), bottommost row (row2) and rightmost column (col2) we can specify a portion
of such an infinite grid (also shown in figure above).

Given the side length of the tile to be used, the topmost row (row1), leftmost column (col1),
bottommost row (row2) and rightmost column (col2) you have to print the pattern within these four
boundaries (inclusive).

## Output

```
Input contains at most 125 sets of inputs. But not all cases are extreme.

Each set of input contains five integers: N (0 < N  20000), row1, col1, row2, col2 (0  row1 
row2  20000, 0  col1  col2  20000, 0  (row2  row1 + 1)  (col2  col1 + 1)  40000). Here M
denotes that the side length of the tiles used to draw the plane should be N . The meaning of row1,
col1, row2, col2 are given in the problem statement.

The first sample input corresponds to the figure above.
Input is terminated by a line where the first integer is zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce (row2  row1 + 2) lines of output. First line contains serial of output.
Each of the next lines contain (col2  col1 +1) characters. These lines describe the patterns within the
specified rows and columns. Look at the output for sample input for details. The output file size is less
than 1 MB.

## Sample Output

```
5 3 18 10 46
100 50 50 69 69
0 2 3 4 5
