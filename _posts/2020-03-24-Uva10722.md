title: Uva 10722  Super Lucky Numbers
---


## Input

```text
Some people believe that 13 is an unlucky number. So they always want to avoid the number 13. In
some buildings you will find that there is no 13-th floor. After 12-th floor there is 14-th floor. In a
number if there is no 13 (i.e. no 1 is followed by a 3) then we may call it a super lucky number.
For example, 12345 is a super lucky number. But if any number contains 13 then it is not a super
lucky number such as 13254 or 21345. Given the number of digits N in a number and a base B, you
have to find out how many super lucky numbers are possible with N digits in the base B. B should be
greater than 3, as because the digit 3 is present in only for base 4 or more. Note that leading 0s are
not significant. So, 011 is not a valid three digit number.
```

## Output

```text
There will be several lines in the input each containing two positive integers B and N , where 4  B 
128 and N  100. A pair of zero will indicate the end of input and it should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line in the input print the count of super lucky numbers of N digits in the base B.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4 2
5 3
0 0

```
