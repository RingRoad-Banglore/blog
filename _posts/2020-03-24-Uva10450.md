title: Uva 10450  World Cup Noise
---


## Input

```text
KO-RE-A, KO-RE-A shout 54000 happy football fans after their team has reached the semifinals of
the FIFA World Cup in their home country. But although their excitement is real, the Korean people
are still very organized by nature. For example, they have organized huge trumpets (that sound like
blowing a ships horn) to support their team playing on the field. The fans want to keep the level of
noise constant throughout the match.

The trumpets are operated by compressed gas. However, if you blow the trumpet for 2 seconds
without stopping it will break. So when the trumpet makes noise, everything is okay, but in a pause of
the trumpet, the fans must chant KO-RE-A!

Before the match, a group of fans gathers and decides on a chanting pattern. The pattern is a
sequence of 0s and 1s that is interpreted in the following way: If the pattern shows a 1, the trumpet
is blown. If it shows a 0, the fans chant KO-RE-A. To ensure that the trumpet will not break, the
pattern is not allowed to have two consecutive 1s in it.

So in this problem what you will have to do is, given a positive integer n, determine the number of
different chanting patterns of this length, i.e., determine the number of n-bit sequences that contain no
adjacent 1s. For example, for n = 3 the answer is 5 (sequences 000, 001, 010, 100, 101 are acceptable
while 011, 110, 111 are not).

## Output

```text
The first line contains the number of scenarios.

For each scenario, you are given a single positive integer less than 51 on a line by itself.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output for every scenario begins with a line containing Scenario #i:, where i is the number of
the scenario starting at 1. Then print a single line containing the number of n-bit sequences that have
no adjacent 1s. Terminate the output for each scenario with a blank line.
