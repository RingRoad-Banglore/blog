title: Uva 13005  Blood groups
---


```
There are four possible blood groups for humans: AB, A, B and O, meaning that the red blood cells
have antigens of types, respectively, A and B, only A, only B, and no antigen at all. Our blood group
is determined by two alleles in our DNA. Each allele is of type either A, B or O. The following table
lists the possible allele combinations someone may have for each blood group:

Blood group AB A B O
Possible alleles AB OA,AA OB,BB OO

We inherit exactly one allele from each of our two parents. So, given the blood groups of the two
parents, we can say for sure if some blood group is possible, or not, in their offspring. For example,
if the blood groups of the two parents are AB and B, then the possible allele combinations for them
are, respectively, {AB} and {OB,BB}. Since the order of the alleles does not matter, the possible allele
combinations for the offspring are {OA,AB,OB,BB}. That means the blood groups AB, A and B are
possible in their offspring, but the blood group O is not. Very nice indeed! But what if life on Earth
had evolved so that a person had three parents, three alleles, and three different antigen types? The
allele combinations would look like this:

Blood group ABC AB AC BC A B C O
Possible alleles ABC OAB,AAB OAC,AAC OBC,BBC OOA,OAA OOB,OBB OOC,OCC OOO

ABB ACC BCC AAA BBB CCC

If the blood groups of the three parents are A, BC and O, then all blood groups are possible in
their offspring, except groups BC and ABC.

The universe is vast! There may be, out there in space, some form of life whose individuals have N
parents, N alleles, and N different antigen types. Given the blood groups for the N parents, and a list
of Q blood groups to test, your program has to determine which ones are possible, and which ones are
not, in the offspring of the given parents.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases; each test case is formatted as follows. The first line contains two
integers N and Q, representing respectively the number of parents (and alleles, and antigen types) and
the number of queries (1  N  100 and 1  Q  40). Each of the next N lines describes the blood
group of a parent. After that, each of the next Q lines describes a blood group to test. Antigen types
are identified with distinct integers from 1 to N , not letters. Each line describing a blood group contains
an integer B indicating the number of antigen types in the blood group (0  B  N), followed by B
different integers C1, C2, , CB representing the antigen types present in the blood group (1  Ci  N
for i = 1, 2, . . . , B).

```

## Output

```
For each of the Q queries, output a line with the uppercase letter Y if the corresponding blood group
is possible in the offspring of the given parents; otherwise output the uppercase letter N. Write the
results in the same order that the queries appear in the input.
