title: Uva 10910  Marks Distribution
---


## Input

```text
In an examination one student appeared in N subjects and has got total T marks. He has passed in
all the N subjects where minimum mark for passing in each subject is P . You have to calculate the
number of ways the student can get the marks. For example, if N = 3, T = 34 and P = 10 then the
marks in the three subject could be as follows.

Subject 1 Subject 2 Subject 3
1 14 10 10
2 13 11 10
3 13 10 11
4 12 11 11
5 12 10 12
6 11 11 12
7 11 10 13
8 10 11 13
9 10 10 14
10 11 12 11
11 10 12 12
12 12 12 10
13 10 13 11
14 11 13 10
15 10 14 10

So there are 15 solutions. So F (3, 34, 10) = 15.
```

## Output

```text
In the first line of the input there will be a single positive integer K followed by K lines each containing
a single test case. Each test case contains three positive integers denoting N , T and P respectively.
The values of N , T and P will be 1  N  70, 1  P  T  70. You may assume that the final answer
will fit in a standard 32-bit integer.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input, print in a line the value of F (N,T, P ).

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
3 34 10
3 34 10

```
