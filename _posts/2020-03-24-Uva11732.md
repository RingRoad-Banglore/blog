title: Uva 11732  strcmp() Anyone?

## Input

```text
strcmp() is a library function in C/C++ which compares two strings. It takes two strings as input
parameter and decides which one is lexicographically larger or smaller: If the first string is greater then
it returns a positive value, if the second string is greater it returns a negative value and if two strings
are equal it returns a zero. The code that is used to compare two strings in C/C++ library is shown
below:

Figure: The standard strcmp() code provided for this problem.

The number of comparisons required to compare two strings in strcmp() function is never returned
by the function. But for this problem you will have to do just that at a larger scale. strcmp() function
continues to compare characters in the same position of the two strings until two different characters
are found or both strings come to an end. Of course it assumes that last character of a string is a null
(\0) character. For example the table below shows what happens when than and that; therE
and the are compared using strcmp() function. To understand how 7 comparisons are needed in
both cases please consult the code block given above.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains maximum 10 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with an integer N (0 < N < 4001) which denotes the total number of strings. Each
of the next N lines contains one string. Strings contain only alphanumerals (0...9, A...Z, a...z)
have a maximum length of 1000, and a minimum length of 1.

Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by an
integer T . This T denotes the total number of comparisons that are required in the strcmp() function if

calls. You can assume that the value of T will fit safely in a 64-bit signed
integer. Please note that the most straightforward solution (Worst Case Complexity O(N2 1000)) will
time out for this problem.
