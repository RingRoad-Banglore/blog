title: Uva 01407  Caves
---


## Input

```text

It is said that the people of Menggol lived in caves. A tribes caves were connected to each other with
paths. The paths were so designed that there was one and only one path to each cave. So the caves and
the paths formed a tree. There was a main cave, which connected the world outside. The Menggolian
always carved a map of the tribes caves on the wall of the main cave.

Scientists have just discovered Menggolians tribe. What a heart-stirring discovery! They are eager
to explore it. Since the terrain is very complex and dangerous, they decide to send out a robot.

The robot will be landed into the main cave, where he will begin his adventure. It doesnt have
to return to the main cave, because the messages of his exploration will be sent immediately to the
scientists while he is on the way.

A robot can only walk x meters before it runs out of energy. So the problem arises: given the map
of the tribes caves and a set of x, how many caves can be explored at most?
```

## Output

```text
There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each test case starts with a single number n (0  n  500),
which is the number of caves, followed by n1 lines describing the map. Each of the n1 lines contains
three integers separated by blanks: i, j, and d (1  d  10000). It means that the i-th caves parent
cave is the j-th cave and the distance is d meters. A parent cave of cave i is the first cave to enter on
the path from i to the main cave. Caves are numbered from 0 to n  1. Then there is an integer q
(1  q  1000), which is the number of queries, followed by q lines. For one query, there is one integer
x (0  x  5000000), the maximum distance that the robot can travel. n = 0 indicates the end of input
file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output q lines in the format as indicated in the sample output, each line contains
one integer, the maximum number of caves the robot is able to visit.
