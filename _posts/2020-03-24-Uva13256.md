title: Uva 13256  Hipn
---


```
Hip-n is a game in which two players take turns by placing tokens
on the free cells of a non-empty nn checkerboard. The game is
lost by the first player placing four tokens identifying the vertices
of a square: they can be of any size and tipped at any angle. The
game ends in a tie when the board is full of tokens and no player
has lost.

The following figure depicts a 6  6 checkerboard and three
examples of squares: the first player putting four tokens on the
vertices of any of these squares loses the game. Of course, there
are many more options for losing a game in the 66 checkerboard.

Your task is to create a program that decides the outcome of
a Hip-n game described as a sequence of plays, by identifying the
player that loses or recognizing a tie.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. It ends when there are no more cases to test.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1  n  200) indicating the number of rows
and columns of the checkerboard. The next line contains n2 distinct pairs of blank-separated integers
r and c in the checkerboard (0  r < n and 0  c < n): each such a pair identifies the placement of
a token at row r and column c by the corresponding player. You can assume that player 1 makes the
first move, player 2 the second one, player 1 the third one, and so on.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a single line with 0 if the game ends in a tie, 1 if player 1 loses, and 2 if
player 2 loses.
