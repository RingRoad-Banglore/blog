## Input

```text
In many table-top games it is common to use different dice to simulate random events. A d or D
is used to indicate a die with a specific number of faces, d4 indicating a four-sided die, for example.
If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the
number of dice. Hence, 2d6 means the player should roll two six-sided dice and sum the result face
values.

Write a program to compute the most likely outcomes for the sum of two dice rolls. Assume each
die has numbered faces starting at 1 and that each face has equal roll probability.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The input consists of a single line with two integer numbers, N,M , specifying the number of faces
of the two dice.
Constraints:

4  N,M  20 Number of faces.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, a line with the most likely outcome for the sum; in case of several outcomes with
the same probability, they must be listed from lowest to highest value in separate lines.

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
6 6
6 4
12 20

```
