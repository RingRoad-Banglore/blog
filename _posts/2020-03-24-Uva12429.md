title: Uva 12429  Finding Magic Triplets
---


## Input

```text
Hermione Granger is very concerned about the magical disabilities of squibs (A Squib is someone who
was born into a wizard family but hasnt got any magic powers). Since the fall of Voldemort, she has
been working hard to invent a potion to cure these disabilities. After a lot of research work, she has
invented that a certain amount of apple juice needs to be mixed with the burnt leaves of birch tree in a
lot of cherry juice. Later, she invents that for a k-year old person, if a amount of apple juice, b amount
of leaves of birch tree and c amount of cherry juice are mixed, it must satisfy the following equation:

(a+ b2) mod k = c3 mod k, where a  b  c and 1  a, b, c  n.

She names such a triplet (a, b, c) as a magic triplet for a k-year old person. She wants to know how
many different magic triplets exist for known values of n and k. A triplet is different from another if
any of the three values is not same in both triplets.
