787 Maximum Sub-sequence Product

Bob needs money, and since he knows you are here, he decided to gamble intelligently. The game is
rather simple: each player gets a sequence of integers. The players must determine, by using their
mega-pocket computers, which is the maximum product value which can be computed with non empty
sub-sequences of consecutive numbers from the given sequence. The winner is the one which gets first
the right result.

Can you help Bob with a program to compute quickly the wanted product, particularly when the
sequence is quite long?

## Input

The input file contains sequences of numbers. Each number will have at most 5 digits. There will be at
most 100 numbers in each sequence. Each sequence starts on a new line and may continue on several
subsequent lines. Each sequence ends with the number -999999 (which is not part of the sequence).

## Output

The maximum sub-sequence product for each sequence must be written on the standard output, on a
different line. A simple example is illustrated in the sample below.

## Sample Input
<p></p><p>1 2 3 -999999</p><p></p><p>-5 -2 2 -30 -999999</p><p></p><p>-8 -999999</p><p></p><p>-1 0 -2 -999999</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p></p><p>6</p><p></p><p>120</p><p></p><p>-8</p><p></p><p>0</p>
