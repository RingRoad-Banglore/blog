## Input

```
You have just moved into a new apartment and have a long list
of items you need to buy. Unfortunately, to buy this many items
requires going to many different stores. You would like to min-
imize the amount of driving necessary to buy all the items you
need.

Your city is organized as a set of intersections connected by
roads. Your house and every store is located at some intersection.
Your task is to find the shortest route that begins at your house,
visits all the stores that you need to shop at, and returns to your
house.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains a single integer, the number of
test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line containing
two integers N and M , the number of intersections and roads
in the city, respectively. Each of these integers is between 1 and
100000, inclusive. The intersections are numbered from 0 to N1.
Your house is at the intersection numbered 0. M lines follow,
each containing three integers X, Y , and D, indicating that the
intersections X and Y are connected by a bidirectional road of
length D. The following line contains a single integer S, the number of stores you need to visit, which is
between 1 and ten, inclusive. The subsequent S lines each contain one integer indicating the intersection
at which each store is located. It is possible to reach all of the stores from your house.

```

## Sample Input
