## Input

```

Youve been invited to a party. The host wants to divide the guests into 2 teams for party games, with
exactly the same number of guests on each team. She wants to be able to tell which guest is on which
team as she greets them when they arrive. Shed like to do so as easily as possible, without having to
take the time to look up each guests name on a list.

Being a good computer scientist, you have an idea: give her a single string, and all she has to do is
compare the guests name alphabetically to that string. To make this even easier, you would like the
string to be as short as possible.

Given the unique names of n party guests (n is even), find the shortest possible string S such that
exactly half the names are less than or equal to S, and exactly half are greater than S. If there are
multiple strings of the same shortest possible length, choose the alphabetically smallest string from
among them.
```

## Output

```
There may be multiple test cases in the input.
Each test case will begin with an even integer n (2  n  1, 000) on its own line.
On the next n lines will be names, one per line. Each name will be a single word consisting only of

capital letters and will be no longer than 30 letters.
The input will end with a 0 on its own line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print a single line containing the shortest possible string (with ties broken in favor of the
alphabetically smallest) that your host could use to separate her guests. The strings should be printed
in all capital letters.
