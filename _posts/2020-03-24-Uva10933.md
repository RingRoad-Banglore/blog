Following, there will be a line with 1 < M < 1000 indicating the number of matches already played
on this cup. The next M lines will have the description of a single match. Each match description
begins with the name of both teams of that match separated by a single dash (-). Following the name
of the second team there will be a collon (:). After the name of the teams it will follow the descriptions
of the sets played on the match. A set will have the total points of the first team on the set, than a
single dash, than the total points of the second team.
