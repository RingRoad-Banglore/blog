title: Uva 13165  Cairo Corridor
---


## Input

```
The Cairo pentagonal tiling is a decomposition of the plane using
semiregular pentagons. Its name is given because several streets
in Cairo are paved using variations of this design.

Consider a bounded tiling where each pentagon is either clear
(white) or filled in (grey). A corridor is a maximal set of clear
adjacent pentagons that connect the four borders of the tiling.
Pentagons are considered adjacent if they share an edge, not just
a corner. It is easy to verify that there can be at most one cor-
ridor in each tiling. A corridor is said to be minimal if it has no
superfluous pentagon, that is, if any pentagon of the corridor was
filled in, the set of remaining pentagons would not be a corridor.

(a) Minimal corridor (b) Minimal corridor (c) No minimal corridor (d) No corridor

The figure above depicts four example tilings. In the first three cases, there is a corridor which is
highlighted in yellow. Besides, the corridors of figures (a) and (b) are minimal, but the one in figure
(c) is not: for example, the tiles marked X (among others) could be filled in and a corridor would still
exist. In the rightmost tiling there is no corridor.

The tilings shown in figures (a) and (c) correspond to sample input 1.

Write a program that reads textual descriptions of Cairo tilings, and for each one determines if a
corridor exists and is minimal. In the latter case, the program should compute the size of the corridor,
i.e., the number of clear pentagonal tiles of the corridor.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is a positive decimal integer T
of tilings to be processed. Each tiling description k
has a first line with two positive decimal integers,
Nk and Mk, separated by a space. The following
Nk lines contain 2  Mk binary digits representing
pairs aij , bij of tiles (0 is clear and 1 is full) in
alternating horizontal/vertical adjacency following a
checkerboard pattern, as is illustrated in the figure
on the right.
