title: Uva 12038  Batting Practice
---


```
After being all out for 58 and 78 in two matches in the most prestigious
tournament in the world, the coach of a certain national cricket team
was very upset. He decided to make the batsmen a lot of practice. But
he was wondering how to make them practice, because the possibility
of getting out seems completely random for them. So he decided to
keep them in practice as long as he can and told them to practice
in net until they remain not out for k1 consecutive balls. But if the
batsman continues to be out for consecutive k2 balls, then the coach
becomes hopeless about the batsman and throws him out of the team.
In both cases the practice session for the batsman ends. Now the coach
is wondering how many balls the practice session is expected to take.

For a batsman the probability of being out in each ball is inde-
pendent and equal to p/q. What is the expected number of balls he
must face to remain not out for k1 consecutive balls or become out in
consecutive k2 balls.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 12000), denoting the number of test cases. Each case contains four
integers p, q, k1 and k2 (0 < p < q < 21, 0 < k1, 0 < k2, k1 + k2 < 51).

```

## Output

```
For each case of input output one line in the format Case k: x / y. Here k is the case number
starting from 1 and x and y are numerator and denominator of the expected number of balls in reduced
form i.e. there is no common factors other between x and y other than 1. The input will be given in
such a way that both x and y will fit in 64 bit signed integer in reduced form.

## Sample Input

```
5
1 2 1 1
1 2 1 2
1 2 2 2
1 3 1 3
1 3 2 1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 1 / 1
Case 2: 3 / 2
Case 3: 3 / 1
Case 4: 13 / 9
Case 5: 5 / 3
```
