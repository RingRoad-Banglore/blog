title: Uva 12159  Gun Fight
---


## Input

```

The above diagram illustrates sample #1.
The imaginary line is represented by the red line
passing through two watch towers shown in red.
There are 5 gun towers in total. The two groups
are represented by two colors blue and black of which
blue group is smaller in size. The yellow arrows show
the two fights where the black ones get defeated.

Here we are in a gun fight again. We have a battlefield
similar to a 2-dimensional Cartesian plane. In some
of the grid points there are some watch towers. Some
of the watch towers have gunmen inside them. Let us
denote them as gun towers. The power of each gun
tower is given as an integer number P . When a fight
takes place between two gun towers, the tower with
higher P wins (No result in case of equal P ).

Now, there are two opposing groups in the bat-
tle. The groups are separated by a boundary line.
This boundary line is an imaginary infinite line drawn
through two given free watch towers (watch towers
without gunmen). The two groups stay in either side
of the field. Interestingly, there are always an odd
number of gun towers in the field at the start of a
battle. This implies that the two groups will be of
unequal size. The smaller group wants to adopt a
strategy to ensure maximum possible success. A gun
tower can fight with at most one of the opposing gun
towers. Again, a gun tower can attack an enemy gun
tower if the Euclidean distance between them is not
greater than a particular distance R. Each gun tower
of the smaller group is given the choice to select its
opponent.

What is the maximum number of fight the smaller group can win?

## Output

```
There are at most 60 test cases in the input. Every test case starts with an integer N (5  N  300), the
number of watch towers. Each of the next N lines contains 3 non-negative integers x, y and P . The first
two integers (0  x, y  10000) denote co-ordinates of the tower. The final integer P (0  P  10000)
denotes the power of the tower. Note that, a watch tower with P = 0 means a free watch tower. The
(i+1)-th line corresponds to watch tower number i (1  i  N). Two watch towers will never be placed
in the same location.

The next line contains three integers a, b (1  a, b  N , a = b) and R (1  R  10000), here a and
b are the IDs of two free towers to draw the separation line through and meaning of R is given in the
problem statement. There will be at least two free towers in the field. There will be no gun towers on
the separation line.

The end of input is denoted by a case with N = 0. This case should not be processed.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a line in this format, Case X: Y , where X is the case number and Y is the
maximum possible number of fight the smaller group can win.
