```
LCM is an abbreviation used for Least Common Multiple in Mathematics. We say LCM(a, b) = L if
and only if L is the least integer which is divisible by both a and b.

You will be given N , M . You have to count number of pair (i, j) such that LCM(i, j) = i  j,
where 1  i  N and 1  j  M .
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 1000), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing two integers N , M (1  N,M  109, and the minimum
of them min(N,M)  106).

```

## Output

```
For each case, print number of such pair.
