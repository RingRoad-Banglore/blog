title: Uva 11196  Birthday Cake
---


## Input

```
Todays my mummys birthday. I want to make a birthday
cake for her. It should contain exactly m cylinder-shaped layers,
and its volume should be exactly n. We number the cylinders
1, 2, . . . ,m from bottom to top. The i-th cylinder has a positive
integer radius ri and a positive integer height hi. To make the
cake look pretty, It should be satisfied that for all i < m, ri >
ri+1 and hi > hi+1.

The surface of the cake will be entirely ice cream. To make
the cake a little bit cheaper, we decide to use as little ice cream as
possible. In other words, the surface area (excluding the bottom
surface, since there is no ice cream on the bottom of course)
should be minimized.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of at most 10 test cases. Each case contains two integers n, m (n < 100001,m < 11),
the volume and the number of layers of the cake. The last case is followed by a single zero, wich should
not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and an integer S, where S is the minimal surface area. If
the cake cannot be made, print a single zero.

```

## Sample Output

```
100 2
1000 3
0
