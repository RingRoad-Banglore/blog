title: Uva 12775  Gift Dilemma
---


## Input

```

You all know Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Everything Sheldon gets, he must give back the same. He doesnt
want to be in someones debt.

Another friend of Sheldon, Penny has given him a very precious gift for his birthday. What penny
didnt know, now Sheldon is going over his head to find out some gifts that will exactly match the price
of Pennys gift. So my first task was to find out the price of the gift. With my super powerful sixth
sense I found out that the price was P .

Now comes the hardest part. Sheldon needs to buy a gift which will cost exactly P . He went
to the nearby shop for this. It is a crazy shop. Because it sells only three types of things: Rubiks
cubes, mouth organs and chocolates. The prices of them are A, B, C accordingly. Now Sheldon faces
a dilemma. What to buy and how many to buy? Because it turns out he can buy things costing P in
various ways. For example if, A = 202, B = 203, C = 200 and P = 606, then are two different way
to buy gifts costing exactly P . The first way is buying no Rubiks cubes, two mouth organs and one
chocolate. The second way is buying three Rubiks cubes, no mouth organs and no chocolates.

Now Sheldon is asking for your help (because I am retired from contests). Given A, B, C and P ,
you need to find out in how many ways he can buy gifts costing exactly P .

## Output

```
The first line will contain T (T  100), the number of test cases. Next T lines each will have four
integers, A, B, C and P (0 < A,B,C, P  100000000) and C/ gcd(A,B,C)  200, where gcd(A,B,C)
means the greatest common divisor of A, B and C.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case print Case C: W  (without the quotes), where C is the case number and W is the
number of ways Sheldon can buy gifts.
