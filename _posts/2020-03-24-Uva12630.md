title: Uva 12630  Equilateral Triangle in a Grid
---


## Input

```text
An equilateral triangle with an integer number of n equidistantly distributed
dots along each side, forms a triangle grid of uniformly distributed dots
within the boundary of this equilateral triangle. The figure below illustrates
such a triangle grid for the example n = 4.

Question:
How many different equilateral triangles can be found in this triangle

grid when the vertexes of each equilateral triangle must always be dots of
the triangle grid?

Note:
Take into account that the equilateral triangles come with multiple sizes and orientations!
```

## Output

```text
Each line of the input file contains a single integer n denoting the number of dots along each side of
the equilateral triangle (2  n  100). The input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. Input
file will contain less than 20 lines.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line should contain the number of different
equilateral triangles that can be found in the triangle grid of the size specified by the according input
line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
3
0
