title: Uva 12270  Periodic points

## Input

```text
Computing the number of fixed points and, more generally, the number of periodic orbits within a
dynamical system is a question attracting interest from different fields of research. However, dynamics
may turn out to be very complicated to describe, even in seemingly simple models. In this task you will
be asked to compute the number of periodic points of period n of a piecewise linear map f mapping
the real interval [0,m] into itself. That is to say, given a map f : [0,m]  [0,m] you have to calculate
the number of solutions to the equation fn(x) = x for x  [0,m], where fn is the result of iterating
function f a total of n times, i.e.

fn =

n fs  
f  ..  f  f,

where  stands for the composition of maps, (g  h)(x) = g(h(x)).
Fortunately, the maps you will have to work with satisfy some particular properties:

 m will be a positive integer and the image of every integer in [0,m] under f is again an integer in
[0,m], that is, for every k  {0, 1, . . . ,m} we have that f(k)  {0, 1, . . . ,m}.

 For every k  {0, 1, . . . ,m 1}, the map f is linear in the interval [k, k+ 1]. This means that for
every x  [k, k+1], its image satisfies f(x) = (k+1x)f(k)+(xk)f(k+1), which is equivalent
to its graph on [k, k + 1] being a straight line segment.

Since there might be many periodic points you will have to output the result modulo an integer.

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases, separated by single blank lines. Each test case begins with a
line containing the integer m (1  m  80). The following line describes the map f ; it contains the
m+ 1 integers f(0), f(1), . . . , f(m), each of them between 0 and m inclusive. The test case ends with
a line containing two integers separated by a blank space, n (1  n  5 000) and the modulus used to
compute the result, mod (2  mod  10 000).

The input will finish with a line containing 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, your program should output the number of solutions to the equation fn(x) = x in the
interval [0,m] modulo mod. If there are infinitely many solutions, print Infinity instead.
