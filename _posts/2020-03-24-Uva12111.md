title: Uva 12111  Hidden Music Score
---


## Input

```text
Do you like music? Lets play a game. I wrote down some notes on a piece of staff paper, then erase
every other thing and leave only the notes. Can you guess what I wrote?

Fig 1. Names of Notes

If youre not familiar with music, take a look at the picture above. The vertical position of a note
determines its name, which is one of C, D, E, F, G, A and B, in this problem (yes, you dont have to
consider notes in other octaves). Consecutive lines in the staff have the same vertical distances. We
call it one standard distance (sd), which is always between 1.0 and 5.0. For example, C and E are 1sd
apart, and D and B are 2.5sd. The horizontal order of the notes determines how the sequence is played
(or sung). The exact horizontal positions do not matter, as long as the relative order is preserved. But
since I never write down ugly scores, you can safely assume that the horizontal distance of an arbitrary
pair of neighboring notes is at least 1sd and at most 5sd.

(a) Everything (b) The Notes (c) Note positions only

Fig 2. Transforming the original score into a hidden form

Figure 2(a) corresponds to the sequence EEECEG. Figure 2(b) shows the notes when other stuffs
have been erased. Then, I rotate the paper and tell you the positions of the notes, shown in figure 2(c).

Write a program to find my original music score, given the rotated positions of the notes. To make
your life a little bit easier, I can tell you the name of the first and last note, and I promise that the
answer could be uniquely determined. The rotation angle is an integer between -60 and 60 degrees
(inclusive).
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains one integer n (3  n  20)
and two different capital letters from A to G, in the order of first note, last note. This is followed
by n lines each containing two real numbers to eight decimal places, the rotated positions of each note.
The notes can appear in any order. All the real numbers have absolute values not greater than 1000.
The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and recognized hidden score. The test cases are carefully
designed such that floating error does not cause any problem.
