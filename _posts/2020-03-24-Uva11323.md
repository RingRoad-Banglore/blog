title: Uva 11323  Satisfying Constraints
---


## Input

```
Consider the following constraint satisfaction problem. You are given n vari-
ables x1, x2, . . . , xn and a set of m two-variable linear constraints. Each con-
straint takes the form axi + bxj = c where a, b, and c are integer constants.
Each variable is allowed to take an integer value between 1 and k for some
specified constant k.

Your goal is to determine if it is possible to assign an integer value in the
valid range to each variable such that all constraints are satisfied.
```

## Output

```
The number of test cases is given in the first line of the input. Each test case begins with a line containing
integers n, m, and k where 1  n  1000 is the number of variables, 0  m  10, 000 is the number of
constraints and 1  k  100 is the largest value allowed for the variable assignments. The following m
lines each contain 5 integers a, i, b, j, and c where 1  i, j  n and 0  |a|, |b|, |c|  10, 000, 000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing yes if all constraints are satisfiable and no otherwise.
