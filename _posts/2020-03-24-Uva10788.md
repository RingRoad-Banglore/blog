title: Uva 10788  Parenthesizing Palindromes
---


```
Validating an expression for parenthesis balance, like many other routine tasks, is a trivial matter for
a computer program. But for human eyes, this simple task can actually be quite painful. Just to get a
feel, see how straining it can be to check if the following expression is correctly parenthesized:

( ( ) ( ( ) ) ( ( ) ( ) ) ( ( ) ( ( ) ) ( ) ) ( ( ) ) ( ) ) ( ) )
To save our precious eyes from the trouble, we find many of the editors and spreadsheet applications

using colors or emphasized fonts to show the nesting of the parenthesis structure. For example, the
parenthesis structure shown here uses parenthesis of different sized fonts to help us understand the
nesting levels:

( ( ( ) ( ) ( ( ) ) ) ( ( ( ) ) ) )
But the solution that we have for those applications are of little use for our age old console appli-

cations. Neither do we have colors, nor do we have different fonts. Here is our nave suggestion: We
may not have colors but we have different letters. And if we run out of letters, we can always use
palindromes! Strange as it may seem at the first sight, this is nothing new to us. We are frequently
using /* and */ to bracket (not to parenthesize) our comments in the C/C++ or Java code. For this
problem, we are only taking it one step higher. According to our suggestion, we could say abbaddcc
is a correctly nested parenthesis structure since it can be interpreted as (ab ba) (d d) (c c).

However, it takes little thought for one to realize that parenthesis structures represented in this way
can be ambiguous. Expressions like aaabba can leave us wondering whether to think of it as (a (a a)
(b b) a) or (a a) (ab ba); whereas the previous expression abbaddcc had only one interpretation.

For this problem, you are required to write a computer program that checks if a parenthesis structure
defined in terms of palindromes is valid and has a unique interpretation.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases. The first line of the input file contains a single integer, T (1  T 
20) indicating the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. For each of the test cases, you will
be given a string S containing lower case letters only. You can assume that none of the strings would
be more than 100 characters long.

```

## Output

```
The output for each test case starts with the test case number in the format Case x: where 1  x  T .
Then any of the following three strings would follow:

 Invalid  the parenthesizing structure is unbalanced

 Valid, Unique  the parenthesizing structure is balanced and has unique interpretation

 Valid, Multiple  the parenthesizing structure is balanced but has multiple interpretation

```

## Sample Input

```
3
aaabba
aabb
bbababba

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: Valid, Multiple
Case 2: Valid, Unique
Case 3: Invalid
```
