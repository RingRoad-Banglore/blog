title: Uva 11188  A Strange Opera House
---


```
Yesterday evening, I have dreamed of a strange opera house which is in the form of a simple polygon.
I was standing on the stage at (x, y) singing Thats All I Ask of You with my girlfriend - thats our
favorite song.

The walls can reflect our voice at most k times. The following 4 figures show how our voice is
reflected.

(a) the opera house (b) our original voice

(c) reflecting the voice once (d) reflecting the voice twice

Audiences are sitting by the walls. I wonder how many of them could hear our song, either directly
or indirectly. Can you tell me?
```

## Input

```
The input consists of at most 10 test cases. Each case contains four integers n, k, x and y (3  n  50,
0  k  5), the number of vertices of the opera house, the maximal number of reflections of our voice,
and the location of the stage. The stage will never be on a wall. The following n lines each contain
two integers xi and yi, the coordinates of the vertices. The vertices are arranged either clockwise or
counterclockwise. The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed. All the
coordinates are integers with absolute values not greater than 1000.

## Output
