title: Uva 13283  Table
---


## Input

```
Famous chef Clmentine Debuf is buying new tables for her high-class restaurant. She has decided to
go for the latest trend, a large model with numerous, wide, yet delicate ornaments. However, she needs
to make sure that these decorations do not hamper the perfectly tuned ballet of dishes.

Ornaments reduce the amount of flat table surface where waiters can safely place dishes. Clmentine
wants to make sure that all dishes can be put somewhere on the table in a sufficiently large safe area,
that is, without overlapping any ornament. Given the dimensions and locations of all ornamental areas,
Clmentine asks you to tell her what impact these ornaments have on the locations available for dishes.

The table is a rectangle of width X and length Y , given in millimeters. On top of it, N ornaments
are placed. Each of them is located at fixed table coordinates and shaped like a rectangle whose sides
are parallel to the sides of the table. Of course, none of these areas overlap each other, but they can
come into contact.

In Clmentines restaurant, all D dishes are rectangular and placed with their sides parallel to the
sides of the table, in a predetermined orientation. Waiters have millimetric precision: They will place
dishes at integer millimetric coordinates with their sides parallel to those of the table. Dishes should
not overlap any ornamental area (but they can touch its edges). Given a list of dishes described by
their dimensions, your task is to tell, for each of them, the number of (integer) locations where it can
be safely placed on the table. Note: only one dish is served at a time on the table; this means that
you do not need to worry about the fact that dishes could overlap, you can count the locations for each
dish independently from others.

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The input comprises several lines, each consisting of integers separated with single spaces:
 The first line consists of the integers X, Y , N , and D;

 Each of the N following lines contains the coordinates of an ornament as four integers x, x, y,
and y, with 0  x < x  X and 0  y < y  Y , describing an ornament spanning between the
point (x, y) and the point (x, y);

 The D following lines contain the width x and length y of dishes as two integers with 0 < x  X
and 0 < y  Y .

Limits

 1  X,Y  2 000;

 0  N  1 000 000;

 1  D  100 000.
