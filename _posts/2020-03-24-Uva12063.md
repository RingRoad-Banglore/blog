title: Uva 12063  Zeros and Ones
---


## Input

```
Binary numbers and their pattern of bits are always very interesting to computer programmers. In this
problem you need to count the number of positive binary numbers that have the following properties:

 The numbers are exactly N bits wide and they have no leading zeros.

 The frequency of zeros and ones are equal.

 The numbers are multiples of K.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases. The first line of the input gives you the number of test cases,
T (1  T  100). Then T test cases will follow, each in one line. The input for each test case consists
of two integers, N (1  N  64) and K (0  K  100).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input print the test case number first. Then print the number of binary numbers that
have the property that we mentioned.

Illustration: Heres a table showing the possible numbers for some of the sample test cases:

6 3 6 4 6 2
101010 111000 111000

110100 110100
101100 101100

110010
101010
100110

```

## Sample Output

```
5
6 3
6 4
6 2
26 3
64 2

```
