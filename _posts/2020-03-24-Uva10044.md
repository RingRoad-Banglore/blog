title: Uva 10044  Erds Numbers
---


## Input

```
The Hungarian Paul Erds (19131996, speak as Ar-dish) not only was one of the strangest math-
ematicians of the 20th century, he was also one of the most famous. He kept on publishing widely
circulated papers up to a very high age and every mathematician having the honor of being a co-author
to Erds is well respected.

Not everybody got the chance to co-author a paper with Erds, so many people were content if they
managed to publish a paper with somebody who had published a scientific paper with Erds. This
gave rise to the so-called Erds numbers. An author who has jointly published with Erds had Erds
number 1. An author who had not published with Erds but with somebody with Erds number 1
obtained Erds number 2, and so on.

Today, nearly everybody wants to know which Erds number he or she has. Your task is to write a
program which computes Erds numbers for a given set of scientists.

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains the number of scenarios.

The input for each scenario consists of a paper database and a list of names. It begins with the line
PN

where P and N are natural numbers. Following this line are P lines containing descriptions of papers
(this is the paper database). A paper appears on a line by itself and is specified in the following way:

Smith, M.N., Martin, G., Erdos, P.: Newtonian forms of prime factors matrices

Note that umlauts like  are simply written as o. After the P papers follow N lines with names.
Such a name line has the following format:

Martin, G.

```

## Sample Input

```
For every scenario you are to print a line containing a string Scenario i (where i is the number of the
scenario) and the author names together with their Erds number of all authors in the list of names.
The authors should appear in the same order as they appear in the list of names. The Erds number
is based on the papers in the paper database of this scenario. Authors which do not have any relation
to Erds via the papers in the database have Erds number infinity.
