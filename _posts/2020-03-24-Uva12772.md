title: Uva 12772  Dynamic accessible Pairs
---


## Input

```

Initially, there is an empty tree. You add n nodes to the tree, one by one.

After each node is added, print the number of accessible node pairs.

Two different nodes i and j are accessible if and only if dist(i, j)  r(i) + r(j), where dist(i, j) is
the length of unique path from i and j.

Note that a node and itself is NOT an accessible node pair.

Nodes are numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . in the same order as they are added.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains n (2  n  100000), the number of total nodes.
There are n lines followed. The i-th line contains three integer a(i), c(i), r(i), that means node

i is connected with node f(i) = a(i)XOR(last ans mod 109), edge weight is c(i), range value is r(i)
(1  r(i)  109).

Note that node 1 is not connected with any node, so we define a(1) = c(1) = 0. For other nodes
(i.e. i  2), 1  f(i) < i, 1  c(i)  10000, 0  a(i)  2  109. For each test case, last ans is initially 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output for each test case contains n+1 lines. The first line contains the case number, the (i+1)-th
line is the number of accessible pairs after node i is added. Print a blank line after each test case
(including the last one).
