title: Uva 12934  Factorial Division

## Input

```text
Given two positive integers n, m, find out n!/m!, where n! = 1  2  3  . . .  n (n  1).

For example, if n = 6, m = 3, 6!/3! = 720/6 = 120.

Easy, right? Now lets do the reverse: given k = n!/m!, find out the pair (n,m) (n > m  1).

If there is more than one solution, n should be as small as possible. For example, if k = 120, the
answer should be n = 5 and m = 1, not n = 6 and m = 3, because 5!/1! = 6!/3! = 120, and 5 < 6.
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each test case contains one integer k (1  k  109).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print two integers n and m. If there is no solution, print Impossible. If there is
more than one solution, n should be as small as possible.

```

## Sample Output

```text
120
1
210

```
