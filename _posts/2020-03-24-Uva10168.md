title: Uva 10168  Summation of Four Primes
---


```
Euler proved in one of his classic theorems that prime numbers are infinite in number. But can every
number be expressed as a summation of four positive primes? I dont know the answer. May be you
can help!!! I want your solution to be very efficient as I have a 386 machine at home. But the time limit
specified above is for a Pentium III 800 machine. The definition of prime number for this problem is
A prime number is a positive number which has exactly two distinct integer factors. As for example
37 is prime as it has exactly two distinct integer factors 37 and 1.
```

## Input

```
The input contains one integer number N (N  10000000) in every line. This is the number you will
have to express as a summation of four primes. Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input there is one line of output, which contains four prime numbers according to the
given condition. If the number cannot be expressed as a summation of four prime numbers print the line
Impossible. in a single line. There can be multiple solutions. Any good solution will be accepted.

## Sample Input

```
24
36
46

```

## Sample Output

```
3 11 3 7
3 7 13 13
11 11 17 7
