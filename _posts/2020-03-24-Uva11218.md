```
One song is extremely popular recently, so you and your friends
decided to sing it in KTV. The song has 3 characters, so exactly
3 people should sing together each time (yes, there are 3 micro-
phones in the room). There are exactly 9 people, so you decided
that each person sings exactly once. In other words, all the peo-
ple are divided into 3 disjoint groups, so that every person is in
exactly one group.

However, some people dont want to sing with some other peo-
ple, and some combinations perform worse than others combina-
tions. Given a score for every possible combination of 3 people,
what is the largest possible score for all the 3 groups?
```

## Input

```
The input consists of at most 1000 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing a single integer n
(0 < n < 81), the number of possible combinations. The next n lines each contains 4 positive integers
a, b, c, s (1  a < b < c  9, 0 < s < 10000), that means a score of s is given to the combination
(a, b, c). The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the largest score. If it is impossible, print -1.
