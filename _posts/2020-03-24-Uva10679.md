## Input

```text
Hmmmmmm.......... strings again :) Then it must be an easy task for you. Well you are given with
a string S of length not more than 100,000 (only a-z and A-Z). Then follows q (q < 1000) queries
where each query contains a string T of maximum length 1,000 (also contains only a-z and A-Z).
You have to determine whether or not T is a sub-string of S.
```

## Output

```text
First line contains an integer k (k < 10) telling the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins
with S. It is followed by q. After this line there are q lines each of which has a string T as defined
before.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query print y if it is a sub-string of S or n otherwise followed by a new line. See the sample
output below.

```
