## Input

```text
In the picture below you can see a triangle ABC. Point D, E and F divides the sides BC, CA and AB
into m1:m2, m3:m4 and m5:m6 ratios respectively. A, D; B, E and C, F are connected. AD and BE
intersects at P, BE and CF intersects at Q and CF and AD intersects at R.

So now a new triangle PQR is formed. Given triangle ABC it is very easy to find triangle PQR,
but given triangle PQR it is not straight forward to find ABC. Your task is now to do that.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 25001) which denotes how many sets
of inputs are there. Input for each set contains six floating-point number Px, Py, Qx, Qy, Rx, Ry.
(0  Px, Py, Qx, Qy, Rx, Ry  10000) in one line and six positive integers m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6
(m1 < m2, m3 < m4 and m5 < m6) in another line. These six numbers denote that the coordinate of
points P , Q and R are (Px, Py), (Qx, Qy) and (Rx, Ry) respectively. P , Q and R will never be collinear
and will be distinct and there will always be a triangle ABC for the given input triangle PQR. Also
note that P , Q and R will be given in counter clockwise order in the input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains six floating-point numbers. These
six integers denote the coordinates of A, B and C. That is the first two integers denote the coordinate
of A, the third and fourth integers denote the coordinate of B and fifth and sixth integers denotes the
coordinate of C. A, B and C will appear counter clockwise order. All the output numbers should have
eight digits after the decimal point.
