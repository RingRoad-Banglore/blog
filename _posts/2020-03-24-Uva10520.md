---


## Input

```
Consider that ai,j is defined as:

ai,j =




{
maxi<kn(ak,1 + ak,j) , i < n
0 , i = n

+

{
max1k<j(ai,k + an,k) , j > 0
0 , j = 0

, i  j

maxik<j(ai,k + ak+1,j) , i < j

You are to calculate the value of a1,n on the basis of the values of n and an,1.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each Test case consists of two integers n (0 < n < 20) and an,1
(0 < an,1 < 500).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case your correct program should print the value of a1,n in a separate line.

```

## Sample Output

```
5 10
4 1
6 13

```
