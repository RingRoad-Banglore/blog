title: Uva 11262  Weird Fence
---


```
In the land of our great Sultan, the World Weird Fence
(WWF) festival is going to take place again. For the fes-
tival, some poles are set up in a Cartesian plane. Each
pole is colored in either red or blue color. You can connect
two poles with a chain that consists of multi-colored rings
thus creating a weird fence. Each pole has a single hook so
you can not connect more than one chain to a pole. Now,
though you have an unlimited supply of chains all having
the same length, its important to note that each of the
chains has a red ring at one end and a blue ring at the
other end and you are only allowed to hook up a ring to a
pole with same color. Also, its obvious that you can use a
chain to connect two poles if and only if the chains length is greater than or equal to the linear distance
of those two poles.

Given the co-ordinates of the poles and a positive integer k, write a program to find the minimum
possible integer length for the chains so that at least k weird fences can be made. The fences may cross
each other.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file is the number of test cases N . This line will be followed by a blank line.
N test cases follow. First line of each test case contains two positive integers P and k where P is the
number of poles on the plane. (1  P, k  100). Each of the next P lines has two integers X and Y
and the word red / blue. X and Y are the co-ordinates of the pole (1000  X,Y  1000) and the
word is the color of that pole. No two poles will be in the same location. There will be a blank line
between test cases.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output a single integer in a line which is the minimum integer length of the chains that
is necessary to make at least k fences. If it is not possible to build k fences with the given constraints,
print the word Impossible in a single line.
