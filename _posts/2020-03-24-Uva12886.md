## Input

```

Galerie de Vues de la Rome Moderne, Panini
(1759). What S.W.E.R.C. had in mind when
he tried to merge his paintings.

Samuel W. E. R. Craft is an artist with a growing reputa-
tion. Unfortunately, the paintings he sells do not provide
him enough money for his daily expenses plus the new sup-
plies he needs. He had a brilliant idea yesterday when he
ran out of blank canvas: Why dont I create a gigantic
new painting, made of all the unsellable paintings I have,
stitched together?. After a full day of work, his master-
piece was complete.

Thats when he received an unexpected phone call: a
client saw a photograph of one of his paintings and is willing
to buy it now! He had forgotten to tell the art gallery to
remove his old works from the catalog! He would usually
welcome a call like this, but how is he going to find his old
work in the huge figure in front of him?

Given a black-and-white representation of his original
painting and a black-and-white representation of his mas-
terpiece, can you help S.W.E.R.C. identify in how many locations his painting might be?
