title: Uva 12760  Arcurves Big Project
---


```

Software company Arcurve has just won the rights to be
the exclusive coders of Project X. Project X is highly so-
phisticated and will require specialized training for several
of Arcurves employees. Arcurve has calculated that a cer-
tified programmer produces 200 lines of code per day, and
a non-certified programmer produces 40 lines of codes per
day. Arcurve has E employees, only one of which is certified
at the onset of Project X.

One certified programmer can train one non-certified
programmer over a 4 day intense peer-to-peer course, dur-
ing which neither of them can code on the project, nor train
others. After the 4 day course, both are certified and can
resume coding on Project X. A certified programmer who
is not already training a non-certified programmer may at any point start training a non-certified
programmer.

Will Arcurve succeed in completing Project X before the big deadline D days out?
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T (1  T  2100), the number of test cases. Each test
case contains three integers: D (1  D  108), E (1  E  108) and L (1  L  1018) denoting the
number of days before Project X is due, the number of employees Arcurve has (one of which is certified)
and the number of lines of code that must be produced, respectively.

```

## Output

```
For each test case print on a separate line either Yes or No, the answer to the question Can Arcurve
produce L lines of code within D days with its E employees?
