## Input

```text

Anatoly Cheng McDougal is a typical student in many ways. Whenever possible he tries to cut and
paste code instead of writing it from scratch. Unavoidably this approach causes him problems. For
example, when he first learned about preorder, inorder and postorder traversals of trees, and was given
code for a preorder print of a tree (shown on the left below), he simply cut and pasted the code, then
moved the print statement to the correct location and renamed the procedure. However, he forgot to
rename the procedure calls inside the code, resulting in the defective inorder print and postorder print
code shown below.

void prePrint(TNode t) void inPrint(TNode t) void postPrint(TNode t)

{ { {

output(t.value); if (t.left != null) if (t.left != null)

if (t.left != null) prePrint(t.left); prePrint(t.left);

prePrint(t.left); output(t.value); if (t.right != null)

if (t.right != null) if (t.right != null) prePrint(t.right);

prePrint(t.right); prePrint(t.right); output(t.value);

} } }

At this point, Anatoly did not behave like a typical student. He actually tested his code! Unfortu-
nately, when the results were not correct, he reverted back to typical student behavior. He panicked
and started randomly changing calls in all three procedures, hoping to get things right. Needless to
say, the situation became even worse now than when he started.

Anatolys professor tested the code on a random tree of characters. When she looked at the output
of his three print routines, she correctly guessed what had happened. However, instead of going directly
to his code, she decided to try to reconstruct Anatolys code just by observing the output. In order to
do this, she correctly made the following assumptions:

1. The output statement in each print routine is in the correct location (for example, between the
two recursive calls in the inPrint routine).

2. Among the six recursive calls made by the three routines, exactly two calls are to prePrint,
exactly two are to inPrint, and exactly two are to postPrint, though potentially in the wrong
routines.

Soon the professor realized that reconstructing Anatolys code and the test tree from his output
was not a simple task and that the result might be ambiguous. You will have to help her find all
possible reconstructions of Anatolys code. In addition, for each such reconstruction, you are to find
the alphabetically first tree (as described in the output section) giving the observed output.

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. A test case consists of three strings on three separate lines: the
observed output of Anatolys prePrint, inPrint and postPrint routines (in that order) on some test
tree. Each of these strings consists of n uppercase letters (4  n  26), with no repeated letters in any
string. The test case is guaranteed to have at least one solution.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, display all possible reconstructions for the test case, ordered as described in the
last paragraph below. The output for each reconstruction consists of two parts. The first part is a
single line and describes the six calls in Anatolys routines: first the two (recursive) calls in Anatolys
prePrint routine, followed by the calls in his inPrint routine, and finally the calls in his postPrint
routine. The calls are described by the words Pre, In, and Post, separated by spaces. For example,
if Anatolys routines were correct, the resulting output of the first part of the reconstruction would be
Pre Pre In In Post Post.

The second part consists of three lines and describes the first test tree that could have generated
the observed outputs. The first line is the correct preorder print of the tree, and the second and third
lines contain the correct inorder and postorder prints, respectively. The first tree is the one with the
alphabetically first preorder print. If there are multiple such trees, the first of these is the one with the
alphabetically first inorder print.

Every reconstruction is a sequence of 6 tokens chosen from Pre, In, and Post. The ordering of
reconstructions is lexicographic with respect to the following ordering of tokens: Pre < In < Post.
