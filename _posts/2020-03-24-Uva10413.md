title: Uva 10413  Crazy Savages
---


```
There are crazy savages on a mysterious island. There are m caves arranged in a circle. The caves are
numbered 1, 2, . . . ,m in clockwise order. There are n savages, the i-th savage lived in cave Ci initially,
and every day, he leaves the cave in the morning and lives in the Pi-th cave in clockwise direction, and
he will be alive only for Li days.

For example, the 4 figures above show an island with 6 caves and 3 savages. The 3 savages lived in
cave 1,2,3. The number of caves they skip every day are 3,7,2, and the number of days theyre alive are
4,3,1. Note that the dead savages are not shown in the figures.

Savages like fighting, so if two (even more) of them meet, they will fight to death. But surprisingly
enough, the fact is: None of them have met before they die natually! Please tell me the least number
of m that will cause the amazing result. There will always be a solution, and m  1, 000, 000.
