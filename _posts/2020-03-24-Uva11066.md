title: Uva 11066  Aragorn
---


## Input

```text
This problem takes you back in time to Middle Earth, shortly before Sauron gets overturned. Here
your task is to help Aragorn, also known as Strider, to succesfully lead an army of elves over the Misty
Mountains. Unfortunately the weather, which has been fair for the last few days, has turned nasty. To
cross the Misty Moutains the army must reach the pass of doom. This wouldnt be a problem if the
skies were clear, but today it is very cloudy. Therefore an army of orcs may be hiding in the clouds.
As the chief counselor of Aragorn your task is to help decide, if it is safe to lead the army to the pass.
This depends on how much of the mountains is covered with clouds.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several testcases. In each testcase you will be given a description of the clouds
and a description of the mountains. Both will be given as a series of connected line segments, the first
series of line segments describing the clouds, the second the mountains. Everything above the first
series of line segments is covered with clouds. Everything below the second series of line segments
belongs to the silhouette of the mountains, as shown in the following picture.

The series of line segments describing the clouds and the
moutains will be given as series of points. Two neighbouring
points form a line segment. Each point consists of a x-
coordinate and y-coordinate. The first number in each test
case is an integer c, c  1000, denoting the number of points
describing the clouds, followed by c pairs of floating point
numbers, each describing a point. The next number is an
integer m, m  1000, denoting the number of points in the
silhouette of the mountains, followed by m pairs of floating
point numbers, each describing a point. Each sequence of
line segments will begin at (0, y) and end at the same x-
coordinate as the other sequence. The x-coordinates of the
points will grow steadily. Each y-coordinate will be greater
than or equal to zero. You should parse until c = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
You are to calculate how big an area of the mountains is covered by the clouds. Ouput the area covered
by the clouds. The number should contain two digits after the decimal point. Be careful about precision
error when the output is zero. Never print -0.00 instead of 0.00.
