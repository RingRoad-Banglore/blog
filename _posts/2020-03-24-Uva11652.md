title: Uva 11652  Power Faster
---


## Input

```
This is Power Faster. In future, this is going the primary study
material for the children of primary schools in Bangladesh. A
durable, waterproof, power efficient and light weight electronic
device. Laptops are out of consideration in the first place. We
are living in a land of hurricanes, heavy rain falls and floods, after
all. And besides, this device is supposed to be used by a 5 to 10
year old kid. Carrying it to school everyday and again carrying
it back home is only possible when the device is truly portable
according to a childs standards.

The flat rectangular part to the front is the display unit. And
LDC screen consisting of pixel arranged in a regular grid of R
rows and C collumns along with a display adaptar comprises the
display unit. The LDC screen has some special properties making
it power efficient in an unusual way. It consumes least power
when exactly 50% of its pixels are turned ON and the rest are
OFF. For any other number of ON and OFF pixels, the power
consumption increases linearly upto the point of maximum consumption which occurs when either all
pixels are turned ON or all are turend OFF.

The display adapter gets a bitmap image with dimensions r c, let us call it the input image, which
has to be shown on the screen. To minimize the power consumption, display adapter scales the image
in horizontal and vertical directions by integer scaling factors such that the dimensions of the scaled
input image do not exceed that of the display screen. The scaling factors in horizontal and vertical
direction are independent.

The scaling process is analogous to enlarging a photograph. When scaled by a horizontal and vertical
scaling factor of hs and vs respectively, the result is an image of r  vs rows and c  hs columns. Each
pixel in the input images corresponds to a rectangle of vs rows and hs columns in the resulting image.
Note that, however tempting it might seem, the display adapter does not perform any kind of rotation.

You are asked to write a program performing the scaling for the display adapter.
```

## Output

```
Input will consist of multiple test case. Each test case starts with a line containing 4 positive integers
R C r c seperated by whitespace. Next r lines, each having c characters on it, comprises the input
image. The input image is drawn using . (dot) and # (hash) characters and there will be no other
character in the input image. You can also assume that, R  C, r  c and all numbers are positive
integers smaller than 30000.

There will be 1005 such test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
Print one line of output for each test case. The output of each case starts with the case number written
as Case n:  (excluding the quote marks) as shown in the sample output followed by two integers.
The first integer will be the scaling factor in horizontal direction, second integer should be the scaling
factor in vertical direction.

If more than one possible way to achieve minimum power consumption exists, output the one with
largest horizontal scaling factor. If there are still multiple solutions, output the one with smallest

vertical scaling factor. All numbers should be positive integers.
