---


```
The delivery company Scrooge Co. wants to establish a system to pay its employees the minimum
money in their travels. The company has information about which the minimum cost to go from a
location to another one is.

They ask you for getting a solution to compute the minimum amount of money that an employee
will receive to go from one location to another one and which the route that he should use to arrive in
is.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single integer 1  C  99 on a line by itself, indicating the number of test
cases following, each of them as described below.

For each test case, the first line has an integer 1  P  99, indicating the number of locations we
consider for this case. The second line gives us the name of each location separated by a TAB, each
name has at most 20 characters.The next P lines contain the minimum cost to go from one location to
another one separated by a TAB, the first line have the costs between the first location and the rest,
the second line are the costs between the second location and the rest, and so on. A cost is an integer
1  C  300, where 1 means that is too expensive a travel between the locations, and 0 is used to
indicate the cost from a location to the same location.

After the P lines there is an integer 1  R  99, indicating the number of routes that we have to
consider. Following R lines containing the name of the employee, the start location and the end location.
The locations names are case sensitive and the name of the employee has at most 30 characters.

```

## Output

```
For each test case you should produce one or two outputs line.

If a route between the locations exists, you will produce two lines, one with the cost and other with
the path according to this format

Mr < employee name > to go from < orig name > to < dest name >, you will receive
< minimum cost > euros
Path: < orig name > < locations separated by a blank > < destname >

If a route between the locations does not exist, you will produce one line, according to this format:

Sorry Mr < employee name > you can not go from < orig name > to < loc name >

```
