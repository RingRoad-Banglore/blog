## Input

```text

John and Mary are brothers, and are enthusiastic about their courses on foreign languages. Each
of the brothers is taking several language courses. When they get home they comment on grammar,
vocabulary, culture of the different countries and so on. In one of those conversations they realized some
words are common to more than one language, even though the words may have different meanings
in the languages. For example, the word amigo exists in Portuguese and Spanish and has the same
meaning, while date is a word that exists in English and French and may have different meanings,
since date is also a fruit, besides meaning a calendar date. On the other hand, red in Spanish is a
network, while in English it is a color.

Thrilled by these findings, the brothers decided to write in a notepad all words in common they
could think of, associating each word to a pair of languages. Observant and smart, John proposed
a challenge to Mary: given one language to start and one language to finish, write down a sequence
of words such that the first word is included in the vocabulary of the start language, and the last
word is included in the vocabulary of the finish language. Two adjacent words in the sequence must
be in the vocabulary of the same language. For example, if the start language is Portuguese and the
finish language is French, Mary could write the sequence amigo actual date (Portuguese/Spanish,
Spanish/English, English/French).

To Johns surprise, Mary solved the problem rather easily. Annoyed by his sisters success, he
decided to make the problem more difficult: Mary must find a solution in which the sequence has the
smallest number of letters in total (not counting spaces between words), and, besides, two consecutive
words must not have the same initial letter.

Note that the previous solution is now invalid, as amigo and actual share the same initial letter.
It is possible, however, to find another solution, amigo red date, with a total length equal to 12.

John did an extensive research on the Internet and compiled an enormous list of words, and chal-
lenged Mary to solve the problem. As there may be more than one solution, he asked her to answer if
there is a solution, and in that case to answer the number of letters in the best solution. Can you help
Mary?

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains one integer M (1  M 
2000), representing the total number of words compiled by John. The second line contains two distinct
strings O and D, separated by one space, indicating respectively the start language and the finish
language.

Each of the next M lines contains three strings I1, I2 and P , separated by one space, representing
respectively two languages and one word in common between both languages (I1 and I2 are always
distinct). All strings will have length at least 1 and at most 50, and will be composed of lower case
letters only. The same pair of languages may have several words associated to it, but a word P will be
never repeated in a test case.

The end of input is indicated by a line containing only one zero.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input, your program must print a line with a single integer, the length of
the shortest sequence that satisfies Johns restrictions, or the word impossivel (lowercase, meaning
impossible in Portuguese) in case it is not possible.
