---


```
Randy Company has N (1  N  100) storages. Company wants some men to keep them safe. Now
there are M (1  M  30) men asking for the job. Company will choose several from them. Randy
Company employs men following these rules:

1. Each keeper has a number Pi (1  Pi  1000) , which stands for their ability.

2. All storages are the same as each other.

3. A storage can only be lookd after by one keeper. But a keeper can look after several storages. If a
keepers ability number is Pi, and he looks after K storages, each storage that he looks after has
a safe number Uj = Pi K.(Note: Uj , Pi and K are all integers). The storage which is looked
after by nobody will get a number 0.

4. If all the storages is at least given to a man, company will get a safe line L = minUj

5. Every month Randy Company will give each employed keeper a wage according to his ability
number. That means, if a keepers ability number is Pi, he will get Pi dollars every month. The
total money company will pay the keepers every month is Y dollars.

Now Randy Company gives you a list that contains all information about N , M , P , your task is give
company a best choice of the keepers to make the company pay the least money under the condition
that the safe line L is the highest.
