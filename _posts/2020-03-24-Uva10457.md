title: Uva 10457  Magic Car
---


```
ACM (Association of Car Modernization) has recently developed a new car, MAGIC CAR. It uses
solar energy. The car has some interesting characteristics :

 It uses up constant amount of energy at the start for any initial speed.

 It also uses up constant energy when stops.

 If it changes speed to a value which is less than already achieved least speed or greater than
already achieved most speed, it uses up some energy. In both cases the energy is equal to the
absolute difference of the current speed and previously achieved least or most speed.

 The loss of energy does not depend on the distance the car covered (Really magic!!!).

Mr. Oberoy has such a magic car. So far he has used the car quite intelligently so that minimum
energy is used up. This was easy for him as he could take any speed on any road. But recently, TCD
(Transport Control Department) has decided that there will be a fixed speed for each road in the city
and everybody must maintain the speed. Mr. Oberoy is in problem now. Can you help him so that he
can optimally use the car?

## Input

```
Each dataset starts with two positive integer, N (2  N  200) denoting the number of junctions and
M (1  M  1000) denoting the number of roads in Mr. Oberoys city. Each junction is identified by
a unique integer from 1 to N . In next few lines there will be road descriptions. A road is described
by three positive integers which are start, end junctions and the fixed speed of that road. There may
be more than one roads between two junctions. Roads are bidirectional. In the next line there will be
two positive integers which are the used up energy during start and stop of the magic car. Next line
will contain an integer K (1  K  5) indicating the number of queries. Each of following K lines will
contain two integers, the source and destination junction of Mr. Oberoy. Source and destination will
not be same. Input is terminated by EOF.

## Output

```
For each dataset print the minimum possible used up energy for each query of Mr. Oberoy. It is
guranteed that the destination is always reachable from source.
