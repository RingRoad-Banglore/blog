Ailin is a girl who likes numbers. This time she learned to calculate the sum of the divisors of a number.
Her father, realizing she learns very fast, decides to ask her a more interesting version of that problem:
Calculates the sum of the divisors of N which are not multiples of K.
```

contains two integers N and K (1  N,K  5105).

```

## Output

```
The output will contain T lines, each with the expected answer with the sum of divisors.

```
