title: Uva 13083  Yet another GCDSUM
---


## Input

```text
Given the value of N , you will have to find the value of S. The definition of S is given in the following
code:

S=0;
for(i=1;i<=N;i++)

for(j=1;j<=N;j++)
if((N \% i)==0 && (N \% j)==0)

S+=gcd(i,j);

/*Here gcd() is a function that finds the greatest common divisor of the two input numbers. % is
standard remainder sign from C/C++/java syntax where a % b is the remainder of a modulo b, so
(N % i)== 0 && (N % j) == 0 means N is divisible by both i and j*/
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input is T (T  100), then T test cases follows in next T lines. Each line contains an
integer N (1  N  100000000000000 or 1014). The meaning of N is given in the problem statement.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print a line in Case I: S format where I is case number and S is the value for the
N of this case. The value of S will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Output

```text
