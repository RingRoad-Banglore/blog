title: Uva 12664  Interesting Calculator
---


```

There is an interesting calculator. It has 3 rows of button.

 Row 1: button 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9. Pressing each button appends that digit to the end of the display.

 Row 2: button +0, +1, +2, +3, . . . , +9. Pressing each button adds that digit to the display.

 Row 3: button *0, *1, *2, *3, . . . , *9. Pressing each button multiplies that digit to the display.

Note that it never displays leading zeros, so if the current display is 0, pressing 5 makes it 5 instead
of 05. If the current display is 12, you can press button 3, +5, *2 to get 256. Similarly, to change the
display from 0 to 1, you can press 1 or +1 (but not both!).

Each button has a positive cost, your task is to change the display from x to y with minimum cost.
If there are multiple ways to do so, the number of presses should be minimized.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 30 test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers x and y
(0  x  y  105). Each of the 3 lines contains 10 positive integers (not greater than 105), i.e. the
costs of each button.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the minimal cost and the number of presses.
