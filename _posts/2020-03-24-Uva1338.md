title: Uva 01338  Crossing Prisms
---


```

Prof. Bocchan is a mathematician and a sculptor. He likes to create sculptures with mathematics.

His style to make sculptures is very unique. He uses two identical prisms. Crossing them at right
angles, he makes a polyhedron that is their intersection as a new work. Since he finishes it up with
painting, he needs to know the surface area of the polyhedron for estimating the amount of pigment
needed.

For example, let us consider the two identical prisms in Figure 14. The definition of their cross
section is given in Figure 15. The prisms are put at right angles with each other and their intersection
is the polyhedron depicted in Figure 16. An approximate value of its surface area is 194.8255.

Figure 14: Two identical prisms at right angles

Given the shape of the cross section of the two identical prisms, your job is to calculate the surface
area of his sculpture.

## Input

```
Figure 15: Outline of the cross
section

The input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a single line
containing only a zero. The first line of each dataset contains
an integer n indicating the number of the following lines, each of
which contains two integers ai and bi (i = 1, . . . , n).

A closed path formed by the given points (a1, b1), (a2, b2), . . . ,
(an, bn), (an+1, bn+1) (= (a1, b1)) indicates the outline of the cross
section of the prisms. The closed path is simple, that is, it does
not cross nor touch itself. The right-hand side of the line segment
from (ai, bi) to (ai+1, bi+1) is the inside of the section.

You may assume that 3  n  4, 0  ai  10 and 0  bi  10
(i = 1, . . . , n).

One of the prisms is put along the x-axis so that the outline
of its cross section at x =  is indicated by points (xi, yi, zi) = (, ai, bi) (0    10, i = 1, . . . , n).
The other prism is put along the y-axis so that its cross section at y =  is indicated by points
(xi, yi, zi) = (ai, , bi) (0    10, i = 1, . . . , n).

## Output

```
Figure 16: The intersection

The output should consist of a series of lines each containing a
single decimal fraction. Each number should indicate an approx-
imate value of the surface area of the polyhedron defined by the
corresponding dataset. The value may contain an error less than
or equal to 0.0001. You may print any number of digits below
the decimal point.
