title: Uva 11922  Permutation Transformer
---


## Input

```
Write a program to transform the permutation 1, 2, 3, . . . , n according to m instructions. Each instruc-
tion (a, b) means to take out the subsequence from the a-th to the b-th element, reverse it, then append
it to the end.
```

## Output

```
There is only one case for this problem. The first line contains two integers n and m (1  n,m 
100, 000). Each of the next m lines contains an instruction consisting of two integers a and b (1  a 
b  n).

```

## Sample Input

```
Print n lines, one for each integer, the final permutation.

Explanation of the sample below
Instruction (2,5): Take out the subsequence {2,3,4,5}, reverse it to {5,4,3,2}, append it to the

remaining permutation {1,6,7,8,9,10}
Instruction (4,8): The subsequence from the 4-th to the 8-th element of {1,6,7,8,9,10,5,4,3,2} is

{8,9,10,5,4}. Take it out, reverse it, and youll get the sample output.

```

## Sample Output

```
10 2
2 5
4 8

```
