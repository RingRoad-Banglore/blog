title: Uva 12662  Good Teacher

## Input

```text

I want to be a good teacher, so at least I need to remember all the student names. However, there are
too many students, so I failed. It is a shame, so I dont want my students to know this. Whenever I
need to call someone, I call his CLOSEST student instead. For example, there are 10 students:

A ? ? D ? ? ? H ? ?

Then, to call each student, I use this table:

Pos Reference

1 A

2 right of A

3 left of D

4 D

5 right of D

6 middle of D and H

7 left of H

8 H

9 right of H

10 right of right of H
```

## Output

```text
There is only one test case. The first line contains n, the number of students (1  n  100). The next
line contains n space-separated names. Each name is either ? or a string of no more than 3 English
letters. There will be at least one name not equal to ?. The next line contains q, the number of queries
(1  q  100). Then each of the next q lines contains the position p (1  p  n) of a student (counting
from left).

```

## Sample Input

```text
Print q lines, each for a student. Note that middle of X and Y  is only used when X and Y are
both closest of the student, and X is always to his left.

```

## Sample Output

```text

A ? ? D ? ? ? H ? ?
