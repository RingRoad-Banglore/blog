title: Uva 12028  A Gift from the Setter
---


## Input

```
Problem setting is somewhat of a cruel task of throwing something at the contes-
tants and having them scratch their head to derive a solution. In this problem, the
setter is a bit kind and has decided to gift the contestants an algorithm which they
should code and submit. The C/C++ equivalent code of the algorithm is given
below:

long long GetDiffSum( int a[], int n )
{

long long sum = 0;
int i, j;
for( i = 0; i < n; i++ )

for( j = i + 1; j < n; j++ )
sum += abs( a[i] - a[j] ); // abs means absolute value

return sum;
}

The values of array a[] are generated by the following recurrence relation:

a[i] = (K  a[i 1] + C)%1000007 for i > 0

where K, C and a[0] are predefined values. In this problem, given the values of K, C, n and a[0], you
have find the result of the function
long long GetDiffSum( int a[], int n )

But the setter soon realizes that the straight forward implementation of the code is not efficient
enough and may return the famous TLE and thats why he asks you to optimize the code.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case contains four integers K, C, n and a[0]. You can assume that (1  K,C, a[0]  104) and
(2  n  105).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and the value returned by the function as stated above.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
1 1 2 1
10 10 10 5

```
