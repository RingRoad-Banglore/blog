Classification levels like Secret and Top Secret are well-known features of military documents. Less well
known are integrity levels, which correspond to how reliable information is.

In the Dynamic Biba integrity model, every user and every document is assigned an integrity
level. If a user writes to a document that has a higher integrity level than the user does, the documents
integrity level goes down. Similarly, if a user reads a document that has a lower integrity level than the
user does, the users integrity level goes down.

Your job is to keep track of the integrity levels of a number of users and documents. Compli-
cating the matter is the fact that integrity levels arent simply numbers; a document might contain
very trusworthy information about operations in Afganistan, while at the same time containing less
trustworthy information about operations in Iraq.

Integrity levels are speficied by arbitrary labels, along with rules of the form A  B, indicating that
integrity level A is at most as trustworthy as integrity level B. The rules satisfy a number of conditions:

 For any label A, A  A is always true, and need not be specified.

 If A and B are two different labels, then it can never be the case that both A  B and B  A
are true. However, it can be the case that neither A  B nor B  A are true.

 For any labels A, B, and C, if it is the case that A  B and B  C are both true, you can
conclude (without it being explicitly specified) that A  C is true.

 For any two labels A and B, there is a label G = glb(A,B) called the greatest lower bound of A
and B such that G  A and G  B are both true. Further, for any label L such that L  A
and L  B are both true, it is also the case that L  G is true.

You will be given as input the labels and rules defining the integrity levels, as well as the initial
integrity level of a number of users and a number of documents.

## Input

```
The first line is the number of test cases to follow. The test cases follow, one after another; the format
of each test case is the following:

 The first line of the input will contain five integers separated by spaces. These integers are the
number of integrity levels , the number of rules r, the number of users u, the number of documents
d, and the number of actions a, in that order. None of these five integers will be greater than
10000. The integrity levels are numbered from 1 to ; the users from 1 to u, and the documents
from 1 to d.

 The next r lines specify the rules. Each line will consist of two integers between 1 and , separated
by a space. The line x y indicates that integrity level x is at most as trustworthy as integrity
level y (i.e. x  y)

 The next u lines specify the initial integrity levels for user number 1, 2, . . . , u. Each line will be
an integrity level number, from 1 to .

 The next d lines specify the initial integrity levels for document number 1, 2, . . . , d. Each line will
be an integrity level number, from 1 to .

 The next a lines specify the actions; each action will be of one of the following two forms (here,
user is an integer between 1 and u, and document is an integer between 1 and d):

 user reads document: The given user is reading the given document. The integrity level for
the user should be changed to the glb of the old integrity level for the user and the integrity
level of the document. Output the new integrity level for the user on a line by itself.

 user writes document: The given user is writing to the given document. The integrity
level for the document should be changed to the glb of the integrity level for the user and
the old integrity level of the document. Output the new integrity level for the document on
a line by itself.

```

## Output

```
For each action in the input, output the new integrity level as described above.
