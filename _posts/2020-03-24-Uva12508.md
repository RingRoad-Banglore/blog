title: Uva 12508  Triangles in the Grid
---


```
There is a grid of n  m unit squares, which has n + 1 horizontal lines, m + 1 vertical lines and
(n + 1)(m + 1) intersection vertices. You can choose three distinct non-collinear vertices to form a
triangle. For example, if n = m = 1, there are 4 vertices, which can form 4 triangles.

How many of these triangles have area between A and B (inclusive)?
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  25). Each test case contains four integer n, m,
A, B (1  n, m  200, 0  A < B  nm).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the number of triangles whose area is between A and B, inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
