title: Uva 11692  Rain Fall
---


## Input

```text
Rainfall is measured in millimeters. The rain is collected in a vertical transparent tube with millimeter
markings, and once the rain has stopped falling, one can check the height of the water in the tube.

In our problem, the tube unfortunately has a leak at height L millimeters (mm). If the water level
is above the leak then water drains from the tube at a rate of K millimeters per hour (mm/h).

We want to figure out how much rain fell during a particular rainfall. We assume that the tube is
high enough that it does not overflow. We also assume that rain falls at an (unknown) uniform rate
during a rainfall, and that water does not evaporate from the tube. The height of the leak itself is also
negligible.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N < 40) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

A line with five positive numbers: L K T1 T2 H where

 L is where the leak is (mm)

 K is the rate at which water leaks (mm/h)

 T1 is the duration of the rainfall (h)

 T2 is the time between the end of the rainfall and the observation of the water level (h)

 H is the water level in the tube when we observe it (mm)

Each number is at least 0.01 and at most 1000.00, and each is given with two decimals.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print one line with two floating point numbers F1 F2 where F1 is the smallest rainfall
in millimeters that would result in the given observation, and F2 is the largest rainfall in millimeters
that would result in the given observation. Values with either absolute or relative error smaller than
106 are acceptable.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
80.00 0.50 2.00 1.50 80.00
150.00 1.00 100.00 150.00 100.00
