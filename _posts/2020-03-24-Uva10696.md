## Input

```text
McCarthy is a famous theorician of computer science. In his work, he defined a recursive function,
called f91, that takes as input a positive integer N and returns a positive integer defined as follows:

 If N  100, then f91(N) = f91(f91(N + 11));

 If N  101, then f91(N) = N  10.

Write a program, that computes McCarthys f91.
```

## Output

```text
The input tests will consist of a series of positive integers, each integer is at most 1,000,000. There will
be at most 250,000 test cases. Each number is on a line on its own. The end of the input is reached
when the number 0 is met. The number 0 shall not be considered as part of the test set.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The program shall output each result on a line by its own, following the format given in the sample
output.

```

## Sample Output

```text
500
91
0

```
