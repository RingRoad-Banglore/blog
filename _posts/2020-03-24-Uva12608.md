title: Uva 12608  Garbage Collection

```
Garbage truck is collecting garbage on its route start-
ing at the dump and collecting garbage from pick up
points in order (closest first). Garbage truck returns
to the dump and empties its contents if it either

1. is full or

2. cannnot load the garbage at the current point
because it will put the load over the weight limit
(the truck driver has no way of knowing the
weight of the garbage at a particular pick up
point until the truck reaches that point) or

3. there are no more pick up points left

The pick up run ends when the truck returns to the dump after the case #3. In the case where
both rule #1 and rule #3 apply, we consider only the latter one (the run is over). Also
note that there are no partial pick ups (e.g. this is not allowed: get a portion of garbage
at some point until truck is full and come back for the rest).

Given the weight limit that truck can carry and the list of pick up points with garbage weights,
what is the distance that the truck will cover following the rules above?
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T on the first line, the number of test cases. Each case starts with the line
with two integers W and N , the weight limit and the number of pick up points, respectively.

Then N lines follow, each containing integers xi and wi, the distance from the dump and the weight
of the garbage at the pick up point respectively.

Constraints are as given: 1  W  1000, 1  N  1000, 0 < xi  100, 000, 1  wi  W . Distances
are distinct and given in order, i.e. for each i < j, xi < xj .

```

## Output

```
For each test case output an integer on a line  the distance covered by the garbage truck.
