title: Uva 12384  Span

## Input

```
Given an array of n integers X1in, the span S of X is an array of n integers with Si being the maximum
number of consecutive elements Xj immediately preceding Xi such that Xj  Xi. In mathematical
notation, elements of S are thus defined,

Si = |Ai|,
Ai = {j  i|k(j  k  i)(Xk  Xi)}.

As an example, the span of the array X = [40, 2, 10, 50, 30, 15], is the array S = [1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1].

Now suppose, for given values of integers m and n, that X1in = (Pi mod m) where Pi is the i-th
prime number. We need to compute the sum-modulus-m of the elements of array S, span of X. If
m = 10 and n = 7, we have X = [2, 3, 5, 7, 1, 3, 7] and S = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 7]. The desired value is then,
((1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 7) mod 10) = 0.
```

## Output

```
The input file provides an integer T , on the first line, as the number of test-cases. For the next T lines,
each line represents a test-case with two integers n and m both in the interval [1, 100000].

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test-case print the sum of the elements of S mod m, as described above.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
7 10
10 16
10 7

```
