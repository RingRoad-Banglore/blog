Consider the problem called Fun Coloring below.

Fun Coloring Problem

Instance: A finite set U and sets S1, S2, S3, . . . , Sm  U and |Si|  3.
Problem: Is there a function f : U  {RED,BLUE} such that at least one member of each Si

is assigned a different color from the other members?

Given an instance of Fun Coloring Problem, your job is to find out whether such function f
exists for the given instance.
```

## Input

```
In this problem U = {x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn}. There are k instances of the problem. The first line of the
input file contains a single integer k and the following lines describe k instances, each instance separated
by a blank line. In each instance the first line contains two integers n and m with a blank in between.
The second line contains some integers is representing xis in S1, each i separated by a blank. The third
line contains some integers is representing xis in S2 and so on. The line m+2 contains some integers
is representing xis in Sm. Following a blank line, the second instance of the problem is described in the
same manner and so on until the k-th instance is described. In all test cases, 1  k  13, 4  n  22,
and 3  m  111.

```

## Output

```
For each instance of the problem, if f exists, print a Y. Otherwise, print N. Your solution will contain
one line of k Ys (or Ns) without a blank in between. The first Y (or N) is the solution for instance
1. The second Y (or N) is the solution for instance 2, and so on. The last Y (or N) is the solution
for instance k.
