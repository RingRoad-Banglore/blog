next month. He is arranging a feast for that. But that is where, he is facing some problems.

He is holding a grand feast, and every guest can bring any number of guests. And there guests can
also bring their guests and so on. The problem is, he doesnt like everyone, and dislike many of the
guests. So, he decided, he wont be inviting every one.

He has assigned a like value to everyone in his guest list. If like value is positive, then he likes
them, negative if he dislikes, and zero if neither.

Now, sultan wants to invite his friends in such a way that would maximize the sum of like value
of all guests.
