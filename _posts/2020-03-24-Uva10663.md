title: Uva 10663  NonPowerful Subsets
---


## Input

```
Lets define a subset of natural numbers as non-powerful if it has no subset so that the sum of its
elements is a power. Powers are: NM , for all N and M  2. Note that 1 is not considered as a power.

Given integers a and b our goal is to obtain the first maximal subset with numbers in the interval
[a, b] satisfying the above property. The subset X is before than Y if X has at least one element less
or equal than every element of Y . If the first value coincides, you must output the solution with lowest
second value, and so on. Such a subset is named maximal if no more elements can be added to it.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, one per line. Each test case contains the two integers a and
b, 1  a  b  1000, as described above. Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input, you should print a line with the numbers belonging to the subset, sorted and space-
delimited. The subset will always contain at least one element.

```

## Sample Output

```
2 3
3 20
4 28
