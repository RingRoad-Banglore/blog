title: Uva 13077  The merchants riddle
---


## Input

```text
A group of pilgrims, together on their way to Santiago, decided to sug-
gest riddles to each other to make the journey more pleasant. Between
them there was a merchant, a pensive and organised man that handled
numbers with solvency.

When his turn to propose a riddle arrived, he made them see that,
in total, they were part of a group of 12 hikers and, hence, they could
walk on a single line, or in groups of two, three, four, six or even build
a human wall of 12 people. In addition, he explained, if they were less
people it would be impossible to make groups in 6 different ways.

I know that these stony paths  he told them  are narrow in a lot of stages but, leaving that
aside, what is the smallest size that our erudite group should have so that we can walk exactly in 64
different ways?

Only when all of them obtained the Compostelana did the merchant decide to, as a present, reveal
the truth.
```

## Output

```text
The program must read, from the standard input, a set of test cases. Each of them will consist of a
single number 1  n  1, 000, 000, 000.

The input will end with a 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the program will write the smallest number of pilgrims that should be part of the
group so that they can be structured in exactly n different ways.

Consider that it makes no sense to make groups of more than 1,000,000,000 people, so if the answer
exceeds this number, +INF should be written instead.

```

## Sample Output

```text
6
37
64
0

```
