## Input

```text
Define r(s) to be the complement of the reverse of the binary string s. i.e. Reverse s and then convert
all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s. Further define a sequence of binary string as follow: s0 = 1 and
sn = sn11r(sn1). i.e.

s0 = 1
s1 = 110
s2 = 1101100
s3 = 110110011100100
. . .

We then program a robot to move at a steady speed of 1 unit per second and make a right-angle
turn according to the characters of s10 after every unit of movement. At the k-th turn, the robot turns
to left if the k-th character of s10 is a 1, and to right otherwise. The figure below shows the whole path
of the robot.

The robot is placed at the origin (the small circle) and face east originally. It ends up at the
coordinates (-32,32) (the small spot) after 2048 seconds. The path of the robot is known as a dragon
curve, a pretty well-known pattern of fractal.

If the robot is now programmed with input string s30 (with identical initial conditions as above), it
will keep moving and then stop after 231 seconds. We want to know the location of the robot at any
given time.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of multiple problem instances. Each instance consists of a single non-negative integer n,
where n  109. The input data is terminated by a negative integer. There will be less than 5000 test
cases.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input integer n, print out the location of the robot right after n second since the robot starts
its journey with input string s30. The location should be printed with the format (x,y) in a single
line.

```
