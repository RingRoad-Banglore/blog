Once upon a time, Byteland was full of brilliant and genius computer programmers and algorithm
experts. Programming contest was a great field for the programmers to test and show their talent.
Now-a-days programming contest have been dried out in Byteland. Everyone is busy with different
types of software development, mobile application development and gaming contest. Different sponsor
provider and ministry of ICT of Byteland is funding different project to develop applications but not
inspiring programming contests.

On the other hand, honorable minister of road transportation ministry is having some trouble with
highway repairment in Byteland, as all the highways has been seriously damaged again on last rainy
season. People of different cities are demonstrating protest against him to repair all the highways of the
country. But recently ministry of road transportation is facing money problems. So they have to think
twice before repair a highway whether they will be able to finish the repairment with existing money.
The minister of road transportation has come up with a plan. He will select a set of highways to repair
such that no city will be connected with more than one repaired highway. He will select maximum
possible highways to repair, but the money is the concern here and every highway has its own cost to
be repaired. So he will select maximum possible highways to be repaired with total cost as minimum
as possible.

The minister of road transportation ministry thought this problem can be solved using computer
software. He passed the problem to the champions of several software development and app development
contests through the minister of ICT ministry. They are trying to solve the problem from then but still
could not succeed. It is your chance to solve the problem and show the minister of ICT ministry how
much programming contest is needed in Byteland to regain their pride in Information Technology.

The country of Byteland consists of N cities and M highways, where each highway connects two
different cities and has a cost to repair. Given the description of Bytelands road transportation, find
the minimum possible cost to repair maximum number of highways where each city is incident with at
most one repaired highway. Cost of repairing is the sum of cost of all the repaired highways.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer, T (T  100) denoting the number of test cases. Each case starts with two
integers, N (1  N  50) and M (0  M  N  (N  1)/2). Each of the next M lines contains three
integers u, v and c (1  u, v  N , u = v, 1  c  109) meaning that there is a highway between city u
and v and c is the cost to repair the highway. No highway will be mentioned twice in a test case.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the test case number, starting from 1, and the minimum cost to repair maximum
possible highways with the constraint given above.
