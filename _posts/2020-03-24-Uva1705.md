A wireless sensor network consists of autonomous sen-
sors scattered in an environment where they monitor
conditions such as temperature, sound, and pressure.

Samantha is a researcher working on the Amazon
Carbon-dioxide Measurement (ACM) project. In this
project, a wireless sensor network in the Amazon rainfor-
est gathers enviPicture from Wikimedia Commons ron-
mental information. The Amazon rainforest stores an
amount of carbon equivalent to a decade of global fossil
fuel emissions, and it plays a crucial role in the worlds oxygen-transfer processes. Because of the huge
size of this forest, changes in the forest affect not only the local environment but also global climate
by altering wind and ocean current patterns. The goal of the ACM project is to help scientists better
understand earths complex ecosystems and the impact of human activities.

Samantha has an important hypothesis and to test her hypothesis, she needs to find a subset of
sensors in which each pair of sensors can communicate directly with each other. A sensor can commu-
nicate directly with any other sensor having distance at most d from it. In order for her experiments
to be as accurate as possible, Samantha wants to choose as many sensors as possible.

As one does not simply walk into the Amazon, Samantha cannot add new sensors or move those
that are currently in place. So given the current locations of the sensors, she needs your help to find
the largest subset satisfying her criteria. For simplicity, represent the location of each sensor as a point
in a two-dimensional plane with the distance between two points being the usual Euclidean distance.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line contains two integers n and d (1  n  100 and 1  d  10000), where n is the number
of sensors available and d is the maximum distance between sensors that can communicate directly.
Sensors are numbered 1 to n. Each of the next n lines contains two integers x and y (10000  x, y 
10000) indicating the sensor coordinates, starting with the first sensor.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.

Display a maximum subset of sensors in which each pair of sensors can communicate directly. The
first line of output should be the size of the subset. The second line of output should be the (onebased)
indices of the sensors in the subset. If there are multiple such subsets, any one of them will be accepted.
