title: Uva 11071  Permutation Representation
---


## Input

```
A permutation is a bijection from a set X onto itself. If X is finite, the elements of X are often
numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . n. A permutation of a set with five elements is often denoted by(

1 2 3 4 5
3 2 5 1 4

)
meaning the element 1 is mapped to the element 3 of the set, the element 2 is mapped to the

element 2 and so on and so forth. Another way of denoting permutations is to use cycle notation. Cycle
notation is not necessarily unique. The following cycle

(247)

means that the element 2 is mapped to the element 4, the element 4 is mapped to the element 7
and the element 7 is mapped to the element 2. The cycle above could also be written

(724)

The product of several cycles is evaluated from right to left. The above permutation can be written
as

(53)(51)(54)

(1354)(1)

(1)(1354)

A permutation can be written uniquely as the product of cylces(
1 2 . . . n
b1 b2 . . . bn

)
= (1)a1(12)a2(123)a3(1234)a4 . . . (1 . . . n)an

if 0  ai  i 1 holds for each exponent ai. The example permutation can be uniquely written as(
1 2 3 4 5
3 2 5 1 4

)
= (1)0(12)1(123)2(1234)2(12345)2

Your task is to compute the ais of a given permutation.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains the
number n, 1  n  200000. The second line contains the elements from 1 to n. The third line contains
a mapping for every element from the second line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case there should be one line of output. Print all the ais on a single line separated by
one space in the order a1 . . . an
