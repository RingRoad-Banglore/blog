## Input

```text
In science fiction movies we have seen that a few man leave the Earth and go far away for better
inhabitance. In reality, this Earth is our only place to live. It is our sacred duty to keep this planet
away from all kinds of danger. You will now be given such a duty so dont run away.

The scientists of Japan, Australia, USA and Russia have discovered something miserable. This
discovery took place in a Laboratory of PONDS (Planet Orbit and Numerology Determination Society).
A huge object is coming straight towards our planet. The problem is that its shape and size cannot
be determined. The scientists discover some signals bit they are from scattered positions. A few
days later they discover that the relative distances between these scattered positions (these positions
can be considered points) remain constant. So they realize that these signals come from radioactive
elements, which are placed on and inside of a transparent planet. The scientists are making a weapon
to destroy this half visible planet. They have also hired Bruce Willis, the brave astronaut of the movie
Armageddon (Although in the movie he died, the director kept him alive for his next movie). But
the problem is the power of the weapon depends on the size of the planet. If the weapon is a little less
powerful that what the planet requires to be destroyed it is ok but if it is more powerful than the exact
requirement the existence of Earth will be in danger. Assuming that all the radioactive elements are
within the planet and the planet is a sphere, you will have to determine the minimum radius possible
of the planet from the given radio active element positions and also the coordinate of the center of
the planet at the time when the sample was taken. The radioactive element positions are points in
three-dimensional space (x, y, z).
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several sets of input. Each set contains an integer n (n < 10001) followed by n lines,
which contains the coordinate of the radioactive elements. The coordinates are measured according to
ISCS (International Space Coordinate System) rules and you dont need to bother about this. You just
deal with the numerical values. A set with a zero value for n ends the input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of output in a single line four floating-point numbers. First numbers is the radius of the
Planet and the last three numbers denote the coordinates of the center of the planet. Each number is
separated by a space and contains four digits after the decimal point. Assume that  = 3.14159265359
