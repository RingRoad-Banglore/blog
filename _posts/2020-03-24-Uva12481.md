title: Uva 12481  KNeutral Rectangles
---


## Input

```
Given an N M rectangle of integers, find the area of the largest sub-rectangle such that, each cell of
the sub-rectangle, Ri,j , is K-neutral cell. A cell, Ri,j , is K-neutral, if absolute difference between the
values of Ri,j and each of its neighbors in horizontal and vertical direction is not more than K. The
cells Ri1,j , Ri+1,j , Ri,j1 and Ri,j+1 are the four neighbors of the cell Ri,j . The neighborhoods should
be considered only in the new sub-rectangle, not in the original rectangle. For example,

9 30 20 25 10
10 1 3 3 9
0 2 3 4 7
1 7 11 10 8

For N = 4, M = 5 and K = 1 in the above rectangle, the largest K-neutral sub-rectangle is

1 3 3
2 3 4
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases. Each test case starts with
three integers N , M and K (1  N,M  1000, 0  K  100000). Each of the next N line will contain
M integers Ri,j (0  Ri,j  10000000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case print the case number and the area of the largest K-neutral sub-rectangle.
