## Input

```

In mathematical logic and computer science, an abstract rewriting system (ARS) is a convenient frame-
work for describing important properties of artifacts such as logical inference, software systems, social
interaction, etc. In its simplest form, an ARS is a set objects together with a binary relation on the
objects expressing how these can transition.

Some ARS are of very special interest because even if an object can make a transition in more than
one way, these transitions will eventually yield the same result. Such an ARS guarantees that if some
irreducible object is reached by successive transition steps, then this is also the case independently of the
choice of the first transition taken. In other words, an ARS with this property converts nondeterminism
from dont know into dont care, thus avoiding the need for backtracking. Let us agree to call an
ARS with this property a Dont Care ARS.

Consider the usual rules of elementary arithmetic: they form an abstract rewriting system. For
example, the expression (11 + 9)  (2 + 4) can be evaluated starting either at the left or at the right
parentheses; however, in both cases the same irreducible result is obtained eventually. This suggests
that the arithmetic reduction system is dont care.

Borrowed from Wikipedia.org

There is no general purpose algorithm that can always determine if a given ARS is dont care, i.e.,
checking the dont care property is in general undecidable for arbitrary ARS. However, because of its
importance, this property has been thoroughly studied and decision procedures have been obtained
for restricted versions of the problem. In particular, the dont care property can always be checked
mechanically for systems having a finite number of objects.

Let A = (A,) denote an ARS with a set of objects A and a transition relation  on A (that is,
 A2). Then, A is dont care if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied:

1. the relation  is well-founded, i.e., no object can be reduced with  indefinitely, and

2. for any a, b, c  A, if there are direct -transitions from a to b and from a to c, then there is
d  A such that d is reachable via (zero or more) -transitions both from b and c.

You have been assigned the task of implementing an efficient algorithm for deciding the dont care
property for finite ARS.

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two numbers n and
m (1  n  1000, 0  m  30000) defining, respectively, the number of objects and the number
of transitions in the ARS. Each of the next m lines contains a pair of blank-separated integers a, b
indicating that there is a transition in the ARS from object a to object b (0  a < n, 0  b < n).

The last test case is followed by a line with two zeros 0 0.

## Sample Input

```
For each ARS output exactly one line. If the input ARS is dont care, then output 1; otherwise,
output 0.
