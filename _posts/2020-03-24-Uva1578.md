```

Publishing maps is not an easy task. First you need some appropriate transformation to display the
earths spherical shape in a two-dimensional plane. Then another issue arises  most high-quality
maps are too large to be printed on a single page of paper. To cope with that, map publishers often
split maps into several rectangular tiles, and print each tile on one page. In this problem, you will
examine this tiling process.

The International Cartographic Publishing Company (ICPC) needs to cut their printing costs by
minimizing the number of tiles used for their maps. Even with a fixed tile size (determined by the page
size) and map scale, you can still optimize the situation by adjusting the tile grid.

The left side of Figure G.1 shows 14 map tiles covering a region. The right side shows how you can
cover the same region with only 10 tiles, without changing the tile sizes or orientation.

Figure G.1: Two possible ways of tiling Texas.

Your task is to help the ICPC find the minimum number of tiles needed to cover a given region.
For simplicity, the region will be given as a closed polygon that does not intersect itself.

Note that the tiles must be part of a rectangular grid aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. That is,
they touch each other only with their whole sides and cannot be rotated. Also note that although all
input coordinates are integers, tiles may be located at non-integer coordinates.

The polygon may touch the edges of marginal lines (as in Sample Input 2). However, to avoid
oatingpoint issues, you may assume the optimal answer will not change even if the polygon is allowed
to go outside the map tiles by a distance of 106.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of a test case contains three integers: n, xs,
and ys. The number of polygon vertices is n (3  n  50), and xs and ys (1  xs, ys  100) are
the dimensions of each tile. Each of the next n lines contains two integers x and y (0  x  10xs,
0  y  10ys), specifying the vertices of the polygon representing the region (in either clockwise or
counter-clockwise order).

polygon.
