## Input

```text
For since the fabric of the universe is most perfect and the work of a most wise Creator,

nothing at all takes place in the universe in which some rule of maximum or minimum does not appear.
Leonhard Euler

The Knights tour is a classic chess problem which was studied (and
probably solved) over 1000 years ago. The problem is, from an arbi-
trary starting position, move a Knight chess piece around a chessboard
visiting all other squares on the board exactly once.

A related problem is to find all starting positions that get us to a
solution. For instance, in the chessboard above you can get a solution
starting at the position numbered with 1 as well as 26, 54 and 7 (due
to symmetry).

This problem is more interesting if the board is not necessarily a
square.

Given a grid of n rows and m columns representing a board, 6  n,
m  10000, find the minimum number of starting positions you must examine, such that we can find
all the solutions for the Knights tour.

For example, in the grid on the right, the cells with the
same color represent one cell and its symmetric ones; so we
can examine only one cell of each color.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer, t, indicating
the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a line
with two numbers separated by blanks, 6  n, m  10000,
that is, the size of the board (n rows and m columns).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output should consist of one line
showing the minimum number of starting positions needed to find all the solutions of the Knights tour.

```

## Sample Output
