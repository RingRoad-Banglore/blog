## Input

```
Secret Santa is a very popular game in which a group of people gives presents
to each other in special dates, like Christmas. The organizer writes the names
of each of the participants in a ballot paper and introduces them in a bag.
One by one, each person takes a paper, which contains the name of the person
to which they will have to give a present. If a person gets their own name,
the process will have to be repeated: being your own Secret Santa ruins the
game, as it is way less interesting.

Parents of little Samuel have offered him to organize a familiar Secret
Santa, and he has to make a present to his mom. He has been confused for
days because, even if he still cant explain why, he suspects that his mom is
his dads Secret Santa and that his dad is his own Secret Santa. Sadly, this game seems to not be funny
at all when there is only three people playing.

He have been talking about all that with his cousin Alana, who has also played Secret Santa at
home with her parents and her sister Irene. Alana had to make a present to her mom. . . who asked
her for help in choosing a present for Irene, because she was her Secret Santa. Alana could not explain
why, but she also knew all the Secret Santa in her family.

Its obvious that this game is not funny at all. Why is it called Secret Santa if its possible to guess
the assignation so easily?
