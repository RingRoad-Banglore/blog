title: Uva 01340  Find the Border
---


```

Closed polyline (with possible self-intersections) partitions a
plane into a number of regions. One of the regions is unbounded
 it is an exterior of the polyline. All the bounded regions to-
gether with the polyline itself form an interior of the polyline
(shaded in the picture below). The border of the interior (bold
line in the picture) is a polyline as well. This polyline has the
same interior as the original one. Your task is to find the border
of the interior of the given polyline.

To guarantee the uniqueness (up to the starting point) of the
polyline representing the border we require that the following conditions are satisfied for it:

 it has no self-intersections, although may have self-touchings;

 no adjacent vertices of the border coincide;

 no adjacent edges of the border are collinear;

 when traversing the border, its interior is always to the left of its edges.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of each one of the cases contains an integer number n (3  n  100)  the number
of vertices in the original polyline. Following n lines contain two integer numbers xi and yi on a line
(0  xi, yi  100)  coordinates of the vertices. All vertices are different and no vertex lies on an edge
between two other vertices. Adjacent edges of the polyline are not collinear.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write to the output an integer number m  the number of vertices of the border.
Then write m lines with coordinates of the vertices. Coordinates must be precise up to 4 digits after
the decimal point.
