title: Uva 10779  Collectors Problem
---


## Input

```text
Some candy manufacturers put stickers into candy bar packages. Bob and his friends are collecting
these stickers. They all want as many different stickers as possible, but when they buy a candy bar,
they dont know which sticker is inside.

It happens that one person has duplicates of a certain sticker. Everyone trades duplicates for stickers
he doesnt possess. Since all stickers have the same value, the exchange ratio is always 1:1.

But Bob is clever: he has realized that in some cases it is good for him to trade one of his duplicate
stickers for a sticker he already possesses.

Now assume, Bobs friends will only exchange stickers with Bob, and they will give away only
duplicate stickers in exchange with different stickers they dont possess.

Can you help Bob and tell him the maximum number of different stickers he can get by trading
stickers with his friends?
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains the number of cases T (T  20). The first line of each case contains two
integers n and m (2  n  10, 5  m  25). n is the number of people involved (including Bob), and
m is the number of different stickers available.

The next n lines describe each persons stickers; the first of these lines describes Bobs stickers.
The i-th of these lines starts with a number ki  50 indicating how many stickers person i has.
Then follows ki numbers between 1 and m indicating which stickers person i possesses.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the test case number together with the maximum number of different stickers Bob
can get.

Explanation of the sample output:
In the first case, no exchange is possible, therefore Bob can have only the sticker with number 1.
In the second case, Bob can exchange a sticker with number 1 against a sticker with number 2 of

the second person, and then this sticker against a sticker with number 3 or 4 of the third person, and
now he has stickers 1, 2 and 3 or 1, 2 and 4.
