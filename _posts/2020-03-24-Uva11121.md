title: Uva 11121  Base -2
---


## Input

```text
The creator of the universe works in mysterious ways. But

he uses a base ten counting system and likes round numbers.

Scott Adams

Everyone knows about base 2 (binary) integers and base 10 (decimal) integers, but what about
base -2? An integer n written in base -2 is a sequence of digits (bi), writen right-to-left. Each of
which is either 0 or 1 (no negative digits!), and the following equality must hold.

n = b0 + b1(2) + b2(2)2 + b3(2)3 + . . .

The cool thing is that every integer (including the negative ones) has a unique base -2 representa-
tion, with no minus sign required. Your task is to find this representation.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (at most 10000). N test cases follow. Each one is
a line containing a decimal integer in the range from -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the same integer, written in base
-2 with no leading zeros.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4
1
7
-2
0

```
