title: Uva 11846  Finding Seats Again
---


```
A set of n2 computer scientists went to the movies. Fortunately, the theater they chose has a square
layout: n rows, each one with n seats. However, these scientists are not all from the same research
area and they want to seat together. Indeed, there are K independent research groups of scientists
among them (no scientist belongs to two of them) with a distiguished leader for each group. Then
the leader bought the tickets for his whole group, and he did it in such a way that all his group could
seat occupying a rectangular set of seats (and everyone in this set of seats belongs to the same group).
Every group was placed satisfying this bizarre condition, although the scientists did not care where the
actual assigned areas were.

The usher was informed of the situation and he decided to annotate in a theater map a satisfactory
seats deploying. He thought that if he wrote the position of each groups leader in the map indicat-
ing besides the corresponding group size, he could tell where to accomodate every scientist. But he
discovered that it is not so easy!

The usher asks for your help. You must tell him a way to place the K rectangular areas with the
given sizes, and with the corresponding leader for each group seated where it was originally assigned.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases, each one defined by a set of lines:

 the first line in the case contains two numbers n and K separated by blanks, with n representing
the size of the theater (0 < n < 20) and K the number of groups (K  26);

 the next n lines describe the ushers map. A one-digit decimal number in the map indicates the
seat of a leader and the size of his group. A point indicates that no leader will sit there.

The end of the input is indicated by the line

0 0

```

## Output

```
For each test case, display an answer consisting in n lines each one of them with n characters representing
a seat occupation for the theater. Each group is assigned to an uppercase letter and all of its members
are identified with that letter. No two groups are assigned to the same letter.
