## Input

```
You are given an array of N integers and Q queries. Each query is a closed interval [l, r]. You should
find the minimum absolute difference between all pairs in that interval.
```

## Output

```
First line contains an integer T (T  10). T sets follow. Each set begins with an integer N (N 
200000). In the next line there are N integers ai (1  ai  104), the number in the i-th cell of the
array. Next line will contain Q (Q  104). Q lines follow, each containing two integers li, ri (1  li,
ri  N , li < ri) describing the beginning and ending of of i-th range. Total number of queries will be
less than 15000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For the i-th query of each test output the minimum |ajak| for li  j, k  ri (j = k) a single line.

```

## Sample Output

```
