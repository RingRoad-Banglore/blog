title: Uva 01408  Flight Control

## Input

```text

Youre the key programmer employed by a flight control center, and youve just been assigned a task
which is to monitor the activity of aircrafts in a particular area.

Since some of the aircrafts in that area are so far away from the control that the sensors cant get
a lock on them, it is impossible to determine the actual number of aircrafts in that area; however, the
scanning of the flight controls sensor arrays has shown the amount of energy sensed in each grid of
that area, and by analyzing that data, you will be able to get a general view of that area.

You have decided to first in order to write a program to simplify the calculation of the minimum
number of aircrafts. you need to follow the following rules:

1. A grid from which the sensor arrays get no reading indicates a grid without any aircraft;

2. A grid with a positive value indicates a trace of an aircraft, and in that grid, a) An aircraft may
be present, or b) It is the trace of exactly one aircraft traveling either horizontal or vertical (notice
the aircraft cant change the flying direction halfway);

3. If a series of adjacent grids on a row or a column are the trace of one aircraft, then the amount
of energy in them (from top to bottom or from left to right) must be either strictly increasing or
strictly decreasing.
```

## Output

```text
There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each test case starts with two integers, N and M
(1  N  50, 1  M  9), the length and width of the area that the youre monitoring. Each of the
following N lines consists of M integers, the j-th integer on the i-th line representing the amount of
heat sensed by the flight controls sensor array. It is guaranteed that every integer in the input will fit
into a 32-bit signed integer.

There is a blank line after each test case. A single line with N = 0 and M = 0 indicates the end of
input file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print one integer on a separate line, the minimum possible number of aircrafts, in
the format as indicated in the sample output.

```

## Sample Output

```text
