---


## Input

```text
You are given an algebraic expression of the form (x1 + x2 + x3 + . . .+ xn)  (y1 + y2 + . . .+ ym) and
(n+m) integers. You have to find the maximum and minimum value of the expression using the given
integers. For example if you are given (x1 + x2)  (y1 + y2) and you are given 1, 2, 3 and 4. Then
maximum value is (1 + 4)  (2 + 3) = 25 where as minimum value is (4 + 3)  (2 + 1) = 21.
```

## Output

```text
Each input set starts with two positive integers N , M (< 51). Next line follows (N+M) integers which
are in the range of 50 to 50. Input is terminated by end of file. There will be atmost 110 testcases.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output is one line for each case, maximum value followed by minimum value.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2 2
1 2 3 4
3 1
1 2 3 4
2 2
2 2 2 2
