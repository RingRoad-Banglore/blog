title: Uva 12498  Ants Shopping Mall
---


```
In the world of ant there is a popular shopping mall named Ants Shopping Mall. The shopping mall
is a grid with R rows and C columns. Any cell of the grid can be occupied by a shop or empty. The
shopping mall is dynamic in a sense that if there is a shop at cell (r, c) (where 1  r  R and 1  c  C,
here r defines the row and c defines the column of the cell) then in a single move the shop can be moved
to (r, c 1) or (r, c+ 1) if the position is empty. But it cannot be moved outside the grid.

The ant queen now wants to visit the shopping mall. The queen can move vertically that is if the
queen is at cell (r, c) then in the next step she can be at (r + 1, c). She has a special way of visit, she
always starts from first row that is from any cell (1, c) and continues until the last row is reached that
is cell (R, c). The owner of the shopping mall wants to impress queen so he wants to find a path of the
form (1, c), (2, c), , (R, c) for the queen in advance such that there is no shop in any cell of the path.
For this the owner of the mall may need to move zero or more shops but he wants to do it in minimum
number of shop movement. Now the owner hired you to solve the task for him. If it is not possible to
find a path then you have to report it also.

j-th character in the i-th line contains 1 then cell (i, j) contains a shop otherwise cell (i, j) is empty.
