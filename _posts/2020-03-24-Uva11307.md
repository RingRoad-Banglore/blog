```
Given a graph, we define proper coloring as
coloring of the graph nodes in such way that
no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If
we map each color to a positive integer, we can
calculate the sum of all colors assigned to the
graph.

In this problem you will be given a tree
(connected graph with no simple loops). Can
you determine what the minimum color sum
can be achieved when the tree is properly col-
ored? (Image to the right shows a proper col-
oring of the second example tree with sum=11)
```

## Input

```
The input file consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with n (1  n  10000), the number
of nodes in the tree. Next n lines will be of the form u: v1 v2 . . . vk where u is the root of a
subtree and vis are its children (0  u, vi  n 1).

Every test case will be followed by a blank line. Input ends with a case n = 0, which should not be
processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case print the minimum sum of colors that can be achieved by some proper coloring of
the tree.
