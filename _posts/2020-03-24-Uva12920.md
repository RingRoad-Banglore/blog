title: Uva 12920  Pattys Gift
---


## Input

```
Last Christmas, Patty was very busy embroidering a beau-
tiful hand-made painting for Tony. When she finished, she
placed a tiny hook behind the frame so that Tony could
hang it on the wall.

Tony is very bad at decorating his house, but he really
likes his gift so he wants it to be placed in the best place
of the house. He plans to nail two nails on the wall with a
rope tied to them, and he wants to have a preview of where
the painting will be placed at the end, before he ruins his
wall with the holes of misplaced nails.

He has drawn a Cartesian plane on the wall, has chosen
two arbitrary points (say (a, b) and (c, d)) where he pretends
to nail each nail, and he plans to use a rope of an arbitrary length (say L). Now... he doesnt know
where the tiny hook of his gift will be located.

Please help Tony to visualize his new decoration, calculating where that hook will be. Assume that
the painting is heavy enough to keep the rope tense, and the knots to tie it to the nails dont diminishes
the length. Tonys world is very boring, so friction does not exist.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases, each one in a single line.
For each line you are to read the coordinates of the nails (a, b) and
(c, d) and the length of the rope, L, such that 1000  a, b, c, d 
1000, and 0  L  5000. Each value is separated by a space.

```

## Sample Input

```
You have to calculate the coordinates (e, f) of the point where
the hook will be placed, after the frame is hung on the rope. Your
answer will be considered correct if the difference respect to the
exact solution is less than 106.

```

## Sample Output

```
2 5 7 4 5.099
2 5 7 4 10
10 20 30 40 31
