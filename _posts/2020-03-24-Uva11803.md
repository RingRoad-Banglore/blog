title: Uva 11803  The Great Merger
---


```
Woohoo and MarcoHard are two prominent software companies.
But due to the rise of rival firms, they decided that they need to
merge in order to compete with them. For this, the management
in Woohoo and MarcoHard are facing some troubles.

Both Woohoo and MarcoHard maintains a hierarchy of em-
ployees. In both companies, the head of the company is the CEO.
Every other employee has exactly one immediate superior.

To make the merger successful, they have to maintain exactly
same hierarchy in both the companies. They decided not to fire
any of the employee. They can change the name of the employees
post (e.g. one company has a post for Software Developer, in
other company it is called Code Ninja), but they cant promote
or demote anyone (e.g. they cant make Developer a Project
Manager or vice versa), nor can they break the existing hierarchy
(that is if a is an immediate superior of b, they should be the same in the new hierarchy). But they
can make new posts and hire new employees. Now, they need to make a similar hierarchy by hiring
minimum number of employees. Since, they are people in HR, and not much familiar with computing
algorithms, they are finding it really tough to figure out how many people to hire. So, you are asked to
this job for them. And guess what, you may be awarded a balloon if you can help them in this great
dilemma. :)
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 500), the number of test cases.

Each test case contains exactly two lines, the hierarchy of WooHoo and Marcohard. Each hierarchy
description starts with an integer N (1  N  200), the number of employees except the CEO, followed
by N integers, each describing the immediate superior of that employee. The CEO is identified by 0-th
employee and every other employee is identified by an integer between 1 and N .

You can assume that, the hierarchy is valid, that is every employee is direct or indirect subordinate
of the CEO and no one is a direct or indirect superior of himself.

There will be a blank line before each test case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the case number, followed by the minimum number employees to hire. Both
WooHoo and MarcoHard can hire, so, this number will be the total number of new employees hired by
these two companies.
