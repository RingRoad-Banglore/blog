## Input

```text

One day, the residents of Main Street got together and decided that they would install wireless internet
on their street, with coverage for every house. Now they need your help to decide where they should
place the wireless access points. They would like to have as strong a signal as possible in every house,
but they have only a limited budget for purchasing access points. They would like to place the available
access points so that the maximum distance between any house and the access point closest to it is as
small as possible.

Main Street is a perfectly straight road. The street number of each house is the number of metres
from the end of the street to the house. For example, the house at address 123 Main Street is exactly
123 metres from the end of the street.

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains an integer specifying the number of test cases to follow. The first line of
each test case contains two positive integers n, the number of access points that the residents can buy,
and m, the number of houses on Main Street. The following m lines contain the house numbers of the
houses on Main Street, one house number on each line. There will be no more than 100 000 houses on
Main Street, and the house numbers will be no larger than one million.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing one number, the maximum distance between any house and
the access point nearest to it. Round the number to the nearest tenth of a metre, and output it with
exactly one digit after the decimal point.
