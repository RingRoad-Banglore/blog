---


## Input

```
On February 19, 2017, Red Matemtica proposed the following mathematical challenge on its twitter
account (@redmatematicant): Felipe, how many terms of the next sequence of numbers must be added
to make the result equal to 200?

1 +


2

1

2 +


3

3 +


4

1

4 +


5
+    = 200

Using this interesting puzzle as our starting point, the problem you are asked to solve now is: Given
a positive integer S (1  S  109) representing the result obtained for the sum of the terms in the
sequence, find out the number n that represents the total number of terms in the sequence to sum up.

= S
```

## Output

```
Input begins with an integer t (1  t  5105), the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each
containing an integer S (1  S  109).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, your program must print one positive integer denoting the number n that represents
the total number of terms in the sequence to sum up.

```

## Sample Output

```
1
200

```
