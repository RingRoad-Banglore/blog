title: Uva 11931  Maze Escape
---


```
Suppose you are stuck in an n by m maze of cells and you
want to escape from it using as few steps as possible. You
know that there is a single cell (door cell) that you can escape
from. However, the door cell is initially closed and you cannot
even move through it. In order to open the door cell, you first
have to push a box to a certain position in the maze (button
cell).

At each step you can move to one of the north, south, west
and east neighboring cells, as long as it is open (not a wall or
the closed door cell). In order to push the box, you must be
in one of its neighboring cells with an open cell on the other
side to move the box into (for example, if you are in the cell
north of the box and the cell south of it is open, you can push
the box, resulting in both you and the box moving one cell to
the south). Pushing the box only counts as one step. While
the box is in the button cell, the door cell is open and you can
escape the maze through it.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of a number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n and m, the number
of rows and columns in the maze respectively (2  n  20, 2  m  20). This is followed by n lines
each containing exactly m characters, representing the maze.

These characters are limited to:

 @, denoting your initial position

 d, denoting the position of the door cell

 x, denoting the initial position of the box

 b, denoting the position of the button cell

 #, denoting a cell containing a wall

 ., denoting an empty cell

Assume that the entire maze is surrounded by walls (in other words, you may never move nor push
the box out of the maze) and that there is exactly one each of d, b, x, and @ (this means that the
door is initially closed since the box will never start on the button). Each test case is followed by a
blank line, and input is terminated by a line containing 0 0 which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line containing the minimum number of steps needed to escape from the
maze, or the words No Way! if it is impossible to escape.
