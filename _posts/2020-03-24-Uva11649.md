## Input

```text
Own home is the sweetest place if it is really secured.
People build wall around home to make their home
more secured. Some pillars are required to make more
strong wall. There is a shop named Home! Sweet
Home!, which sells pillar specially made for building
walls. This is really a busy shop. Everyday lot of
contractors come, who are responsible for building
walls, having a list of homes in their hands. Their
list usually contains information of homes specially
height of the home and number of pillars required to
build that home.

They find pillars are arranged in a row in that
shop. Every pillars in row are tagged with heights. Every contractors want to buy some pillars such
that they can make walls for all those homes in their list. But unfortunately the shop has some
limitation of pillars. So the owner of that shop decides to hire you to write a program for them, which
can calculate the number of maximum possible home, for which the contractor can build wall using the
pillars in that shop.

Note that, a pillar having less height than a home cannot be used to build wall in that home for
security purpose.

## Output

```text
First line of input will contain a number T (1  T  200), which indicates the number of test cases. Each
test case starts with a line having two integers NP and NH (1  NP  100000, 1  NH  100000),
number of pillars in Home! Sweet Home! and number of homes in contractors list. The next line
will contain three integers A, B and C (1  A,B,C  10000). You can calculate height of the pillars
of the shop by this way -

PH1 = C % 10000 + 1
PH2 = (A  PH1 + C) % 10000 + 1
PHi = (A  PHi1 + B  PHi2 + C) % 10000 + 1, where 3  i  NP .

Here PHi represents the height of i-th pillar in the row of the shop.

The next line will contain six integers E, F , G, H, I and J . (1  E,F,G,H, I, J  10000). You
can generate the height of the homes and number of pillars required for corresponding homes in the list
by this way

HH1 = G % 10000 + 1
PR1 = J % 100000 + 1
HHi = (E  HHi1 + F  PRi1 + G) % 10000 + 1, where 2  i  NH
PRi = (H  PRi1 + I  HHi1 + J) % 100000 + 1, where 2  i  NH

Here HHi represents height of i-th home and PRi represents number of pillars required to build
wall for i-th home.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a single line of the form Case X: N , where X denotes the case number
and N denotes the maximum number home for which it is possible to make a wall.
