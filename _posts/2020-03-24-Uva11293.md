title: Uva 11293  Tournament
---


```
Every September, the Kingdom of
Loowater holds a jousting tournament.
In each of a series of event, a pair of
knights attempt to knock each other from
their respective horses. The winning
knight is paired with another, while the
loser is elimnated. This process contin-
ues until all but one knight is eliminated;
this knight is declared champion.

The tournament schedule is organized
so that no knight needs to compete in
more than e events to be champion, for
the minimum possible e given k, the num-
ber of knights. In order to construct the
schedule, it may be necessary to identify
several knights who compete in fewer than e events; these knights are said to be awarded a bye and are
excluded from the first round of competition.

The first round of competition involves pairing as many knights as possible among those who are not
awarded a bye. The competition is more interesting if the knights in each pair are as evenly matched
in ability as possible. You are to determine which knights should be awarded a bye so as to make the
first round as interesting as possible.
```

## Input

```
Standard input consists of several test cases followed by a line containing 0. Each test case begins
with an integer 1 < k  2500, the number of knights. i lines follow, each giving the name and ability
of a knight. The name is a string of lower case letters not longer than 20; the ability is a real number.

The mismatch between knights with abilities a and b respectively is defined to be (a b)2.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the names of the knights to be given a bye such that the sum of all mismatch
values for pairs of knights competing in the first round is minimized. If there are several solutions, any
will do. Output an empty line between test cases.
