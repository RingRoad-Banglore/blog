11699 Rooks
You have unexpectedly become the owner of a large chessboard, having fifteen
squares to each side. Because you do not know how to play chess on such a
large board, you find an alternative way to make use of it.

In chess, a rook attacks all squares that are in the same row or column of
the chessboard as it is. For the purposes of this problem, we define a rook as
also attacking the square on which it is already standing.

Given a set of chessboard squares, how many rooks are needed to attack
all of them?

## Input
Input consists of a number of test cases. Each test case consists of fifteen lines
each containing fifteen characters depicting the chess board. Each character
is either a period (.) or a hash (#). Every chessboard square depicted by a
hash must be attacked by a rook. After all the test cases, one more line of
input appears. This line contains the word ‘END’.

## Output
Output consists of exactly one line for each test case. The line contains a
single integer, the minimum number of rooks that must be placed on the chess board so that every
square marked with a hash is attacked.
