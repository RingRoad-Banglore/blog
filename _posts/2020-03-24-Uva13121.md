title: Uva 13121  Eclipsing Gianik Star
---


## Input

```text
Gianik is a giant pink star in Canis Major constellation at an approximate distance of 700 light years
from our Solar System. Each planet of Gianiks planetary system follows a trajectory described by a
circular orbit centered at Gianik, whose coordinates (x(t), y(t)) at time t obeys the parametric equations

x (t) =   cos (+  t)
y (t) =   sin (+  t)

where  is a positive integer denoting the radius of the circular orbit, and  +  t is a linear function
with integer coefficients , describing the angle subtended by the planets trajectory from time 0 to
time t. All angles are measured in degrees (), where one full rotation around Gianik takes 360.

An eclipse occurs when Gianik and two distinct planets are located at collinear coordinates at the
same time t, so that Gianik is not visible from the farthest planet because it is eclipsed by the other
planet. May you determine the minimum non-negative integer t such that an eclipse occurs at time t?
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
indicating the number of planets of Gianiks planetary system (2  N  300). Each of the next N
lines contains three blank-separated integers ,  and , indicating the parameters that describe the
planets trajectory around Gianik according to the statement (1    1000, 1000 <  < 1000,
1000 <  < 1000). You may assume that the orbits of all N planets have distinct radiuses.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a single line with a non-negative integer indicating the minimum time in which
an eclipse occurs in Gianiks planetary system. If no eclipse occurs at any non-negative time, then print
the text GIANIK IS NEVER ECLIPSED.
