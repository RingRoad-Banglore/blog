title: Uva 11101  Mall Mania
---


```
Waterloo has two giant shop-
ping malls, each enclosing
several city blocks. Kim and
Pat like to shop and to walk
within the malls but they
dont like walking between
the malls because such walk-
ing does not contribute di-
rectly to the task at hand:
shopping. They would there-
fore like to know the min-
imum crossing distance be-
tween the malls.

Each city block is a unit
square delimited by streets
and avenues. Streets run
east-west and avenues run
north-south. Both are iden-
tified by consecutive integers
between 0 and 2000. (Lower
numbered avenues are west of
higher numbered avenues and lower numbered streets are south of higher numbered streets.) Streets
and avenues are narrow so their thickness may be assumed to be 0.

Each mall is a contiguous set of complete city blocks. By contiguous we mean that any two blocks
are connected by some sequence of blocks such that consecutive pairs of blocks in the sequence share a
side. The malls do not intersect and do not surround any empty blocks; that is, the blocks not in any
mall are themselves contiguous.
```

## Input

```
Standard input contains several test cases. Each test case contains the description of the two malls.
Each malls description consists of an integer p  4, the perimeter of the mall, followed by one or more
lines containing p pairs (a, s) giving the coordinates of the avenue-street intersections contained in the
perimeter, in clockwise order. A line containing 0 follows the last test case.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output a single integer d  the minimum walking distance between the malls, assuming
that Kim and Pat always walk along streets and avenues.
