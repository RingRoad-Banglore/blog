## Input

```text
The Association of Cookie Makers (ACM) has developed its newest and most decadent cookie in history,
the Square Chocolate Chip Cookie. This new cookie is a biscuit delight with lots and lots of chocolate
chips for all the cookie lovers out there. However, in the development of this revolutionary type of cookie,
the chocolate chips sprinklers have had some problems; though all the chips fall on the cookie, they are
not evenly spread.

With a tradition of more than 26 years of cookie making, ACM sprinklers cannot be replaced. That
is why the sales department has decided to cut the cookie in several pieces to maximize revenue. Each
cut is made by a laser that moves across the cookie following a straight line path. Any chip chocolate
on the laser path is destroyed during the cut process. Each piece of a square cookie is then valued
according to its chocolate chip density, defined as the number of chips that it has, divided by its area.

A sample square cookie
cut in 6 pieces.

The following figure shows an original cookie with four chips and three
cuts. It is apparent that the piece at the lower right corner has a maximal
chocolate chip density.

As part of the product testing team at ACM, you have to write a program
that detects the maximal chocolate chip density among the resulting pieces,
given an original square chocolate cookie, the positions on it that received a
chocolate chip, and the cuts that should be made.

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line in a test case contains
three integers L, C, and K, separated by blanks, where L is the length of
the cookie side, C is the number of chips, and K is the number of cuts (2  L  500, 0  C  5000,
0  K  50). Each one of the following C lines contains two blank-separated integers x and y,
representing the (x, y) coordinates of a chocolate chip (0 < x < L, 0 < y < L) in a Cartesian coordinate
system where the cookie is represented by the square with vertices (0, 0), (L, 0), (L,L), and (0, L). Each
one of the following K lines contains four blank-separated integers x1, y1, x2, and y2, representing two
distinct points on a straight line that defines a cut on the same coordinate system (0  x1, y1, x2, y2  L).
You may suppose that there are not two chocolate chips placed at the same location. The last test case
is followed by a line containing three zeros.

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output a single line with a number indicating the maximal chocolate chip density among
all the resulting pieces after the cuts. You may suppose that no answer will be greater than 102. The
answer should be formatted and approximated to three decimal places. The floating point delimiter
must be . (i.e., the dot). The rounding applies towards the nearest neighbor unless both neighbors
are equidistant, in which case the result is rounded up (e.g., 78.3712 is rounded to 78.371; 78.5766 is
rounded to 78.577; 78.3745 is rounded to 78.375, etc.).
