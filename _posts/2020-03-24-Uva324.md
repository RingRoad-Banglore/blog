title: Uva 00324  Factorial Frequencies
---


```
In an attempt to bolster her sagging palm-reading business, Madam Phoenix has decided to offer
several numerological treats to her customers. She has been able to convince them that the frequency
of occurrence of the digits in the decimal representation of factorials bear witness to their futures.
Unlike palm-reading, however, she cant just conjure up these frequencies, so she has employed you to
determine these values.

Recall that the definition of n! (that is, n factorial) is just 1 2 3   n. As she expects to use
either the day of the week, the day of the month, or the day of the year as the value of n, you must be
able to determine the number of occurrences of each decimal digit in numbers as large as 366 factorial
(366!), which has 781 digits.

Madam Phoenix will be forever (or longer) in your debt; she might even give you a trip if you do
your job well!
```

## Input

```
The input data for the program is simply a list of integers for which the digit counts are desired. All
of these input values will be less than or equal to 366 and greater than 0, except for the last integer,
which will be zero. Dont bother to process this zero value; just stop your program at that point.

```

## Output

```
The output format isnt too critical, but you should make your program produce results that look
similar to those shown below.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
8
100
0

```

## Sample Output

```
3! --

(0) 0 (1) 0 (2) 0 (3) 0 (4) 0
(5) 0 (6) 1 (7) 0 (8) 0 (9) 0

8! --
(0) 2 (1) 0 (2) 1 (3) 1 (4) 1
(5) 0 (6) 0 (7) 0 (8) 0 (9) 0

100! --
(0) 30 (1) 15 (2) 19 (3) 10 (4) 10
(5) 14 (6) 19 (7) 7 (8) 14 (9) 20
