title: Uva 10909  Lucky Number
---


## Input

```text
Lucky numbers are defined by a variation of the well-known sieve of Eratosthenes. Beginning
with the natural numbers strike out all even ones, leaving the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . .
The second number is 3, next strike out every third number, leaving 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, . . . The third
number is 7, next strike out every seventh number and continue this process infinite number of
times. The numbers surviving are called lucky numbers. The first few lucky numbers are:

1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, 33, . . . . . .

In this problem your task is to test whether a number can be written as the sum of two lucky
numbers.

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 100000 lines of input. Each line contains a single integer n (0 < n 
2000000). Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line should be of one of the following types
depending on whether n is expressible as the sum of two lucky numbers.

n is not the sum of two luckies!
n is the sum of L1 and L2.

For the second case, always make sure that (L2  L1) is nonnegative and minimized.

```

## Sample Output

```text
11
12
