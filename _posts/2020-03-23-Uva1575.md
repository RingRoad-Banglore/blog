1575 Factors

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely rep-
resented as a product of one or more primes. While unique, several arrangements of the prime factors
may be possible. For example:

10 = 2 * 5 20 = 2 * 2 * 5

= 5 * 2 = 2 * 5 * 2

= 5 * 2 * 2

Let f(k) be the number of different arrangements of the prime factors of k. So f(10) = 2 and
f(20) = 3.

Given a positive number n, there always exists at least one number k such that f(k) = n. We want
to know the smallest such k.

## Input

The input consists of at most 1000 test cases, each on a separate line. Each test case is a positive
integer n < 263.

## Output

For each test case, display its number n and the smallest number k > 1 such that f(k) = n. The
numbers in the input are chosen such that k < 263.

## Sample Input

## Sample Output
