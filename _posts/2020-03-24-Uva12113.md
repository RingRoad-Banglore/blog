Fig 1. Placing four filled squares in
an empty 4 4 grid.

In most puzzles we are given some pieces and we have to make a
target pattern which can be built in only one possible way. But
some puzzles are a bit different, we are given a target pattern and
from that target pattern we have to find in how many ways the
pieces can be placed. Such a puzzle is the puzzle of overlapping
squares. To understand this puzzle, look at the pictures below:

In first figure we have placed a (22) filled square in a (44)
grid. In the second figure we have placed another (2  2) filled
square in the grid, which have of course deleted some part of the
black lines of the previous square, in third picture we have placed
a third square and in the fourth picture we have placed a fourth
square. The picture can become even more complex if we place
more (2 2) squares.

Write a program to determine if its possible to form a target
image using between 1 and 6 pieces (inclusive) of 2 2 squares.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is contained in five lines and each line contains
nine characters. If the horizontal border of a filled square is visible it is denoted with _ (ASCII value
95) sign and if vertical border of a filled square is visible then it is denoted with | (ASCII value 124)
character. The board contains no other character than _, | and of course   (ASCII Value 32). The
border lines of the squares can only be along the grid lines. Each board lines end with a # (Hash
character) which denotes the end of line. This character is not a part of the grid or square. The last
test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and Yes or No, depending on whether its possible to form
the target.
