## Input

```text

Professor Heickal absolutely hates cycles. So when it comes to graphs, he is partial to trees and
forests. Not surprisingly, his favorite band is Porcupine Tree, favorite movie is the Forrest Gump
and he loves eating Black Forests. Anyway, in one evening, I went to him to discuss about problems
concerning people, country, the world and the humankind.

In the middle of our discussion, he suddenly said, See! Everybody loves cycles! People like to live
the life their ancestors lived, the world leaders never learn from their mistakes, people cut down trees
and destroy forests all the time and Professor Hawlader keeps on giving people amulets to change their
fortunes! These kinds of things are recurring all the time! You got to stop these recurrences by putting
a base case. Scientists say, Dynamic Programming is very important for life. Everyone knows that
trees, forests and directed acyclic graphs are suitable for DP... . At that point, he noticed that I was
nervously checking my watch. He changed the topic and said, Lets solve an interesting problem! And
its about... trees!

The problem was like this: Given the number of nodes at different depths of a rooted tree, count
the number of valid trees possible with that configuration. Formally, you will be given an array C with
Ci = number of nodes at depthi (explanations of the terms is given afterwards). Each node of the tree
is labeled with a unique integer. The nodes are labeled in this way:

Let, Si = C0 + C1 + . . .+ Ci
The root is labeled with 1.

The nodes at depth 1 are labeled by integers from 2 to S1 (inclusive) . . . . . .

The nodes at depth d are labeled by integers from Sd1 + 1 to Sd (inclusive)

Youll need to find out the number of k-ary trees with C array.

A tree is a connected graph without a cycle. A tree is called a rooted tree
if one vertex has been designated the root, in which case the edges have a
natural orientation, away from the root. The depth of a node is the length
of the path to its root. A k-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has
no more than k children.

Anyway, as I was severely disoriented by that discussion with the profes-
sor, I could not solve the problem that time. What about you?

## Output

```text
The first line of the input will contain the number T , the number of test cases.
It will be followed by T sets of inputs. Each set of test case will have two lines. First line will contain
pair of integers d, depth of the tree and k, as defined in the statement. In the next line, there will be
d+ 1 integers, giving the C array where i-th integer will be the value of Ci.

Constraints:
1  T  256
0  d  512
0  k  8
0  Ci  512 (1  i  d) and C0 = 1

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input, print the output in the format Case X: Y  (here, X is the serial of the input
and Y is the answer) in a line. As the output can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000009.

```
