title: Uva 11315  Attacker
---


## Input

```
There are k attackers in an n m chessboard.

The i-th attacker is located in (Xi, Yi), with a attacking range of Ri.
A square (X,Y ) is attacked by the i-th attacker if and only if |X Xi|+ |Y  Yi|  Ri.
Count the number of squares on the chessboard attacked by at least one attacker.
```

## Output

```
There are several input cases. The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1  n,m  100000000, 1 
k  20000). In the following k lines, each line contains three integers Xi, Yi, Ri (1  Xi  n,
1  Yi  m, 1  Ri  1000000), the position and attack range of each attacker.

The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and the answer.
