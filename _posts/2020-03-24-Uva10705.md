title: Uva 10705  The Fun Number System
---


```
In a k bit 2s complement number, where the bits are indexed from 0 to k  1, the weight of the most
significant bit (i.e., in position k1), is 2k1, and the weight of a bit in any position i (0  i < k1)
is 2i. For example, a 3 bit number 101 is evaluated as 22 + 0+ 20 = 3 and 011 as 0 + 21 + 20 = 3.
A negatively weighted bit is called a negabit(such as the most significant bit in a 2s complement
number), and a positively weighted bit is called a posibit.

A Fun number system is a positional binary number system, where each bit can be either a negabit,
or a posibit. For example consider a 3-bit fun number system Fun3, where bits in positions 0, and 2 are
posibits, and the bit in position 1 is a negabit. (111)Fun3 is evaluated as 2221+1 = 3. Now you are
going to have fun with the Fun number systems! You are given the description of a k-bit Fun number
system Funk, and an integer N (Maybe negative). You should determine the k bits of a representation
of N in Funk, or report that it is not possible to represent the given N in the given Funk. For example,
a representation of -1 in the Fun3 number system (defined above), is 011 (evaluated as 0  21 + 20),
and representing 6 in Fun3 is impossible.

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (0 < t  100), the number of test cases, followed
by the input data for each test case.

Each test case is given in three consecutive lines. In the first line there is a positive integer k
(1  k  64). In the second line of a test data there is a string of length k, composed only of letters
n, and p, describing the Fun number system for that test data, where each n(p) indicates that the
bit in that position is a negabit (posibit). The third line of each test data contains an integer N
(263  N < 263), the number to be represented in the Funk number by your program.

```

## Output

```
For each test data, you should print one line containing either a k-bit string representing the given
number N in the Funk number system, or the word Impossible, when it is impossible to represent
the given number.
