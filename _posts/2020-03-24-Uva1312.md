## Input

```

Once upon a time there was a greedy King who
ordered his chief Architect to build a field for
royal cricket inside his park. The King was so
greedy, that he would not listen to his Archi-
tects proposals to build a field right in the park
center with pleasant patterns of trees specially
planted around and beautiful walks inside tree
alleys for spectators. Instead, he ordered nei-
ther to cut nor to plant even a single tree in his
park, but demanded to build the largest pos-
sible cricket field for his pleasure. If the Kind
finds that the Architect has dared to touch even
a single tree in his park or designed a smaller
field that it was possible, then the Architect will loose his head. Moreover, he demanded his Architect
to introduce at once a plan of the field with its exact location and size.

Your task is to help poor Architect to save his head, by writing a program that will find the maximum
possible size of the cricket field and its location inside the park to satisfy Kings requirements.

The task is somewhat simplified by the fact, that Kings park has a rectangular shape and is situated
on a flat ground. Moreover, parks borders are perfectly aligned with North-South and East-West lines.
At the same time, royal cricket is always played on a square field that is also aligned with North-South
and East-West lines. Architect has already established a Cartesian coordinate system and has precisely
measured the coordinates of every tree. This coordinate system is, of course, aligned with North-South
and East-West lines. Southwestern corner of the park has coordinates (0, 0) and Northeastern corner
of the part has coordinates (W,H), where W and H are the park width and height in feet respectively.

For this task, you may neglect the diameter of the trees. Trees cannot be inside the cricket field,
but may be situated on its side. The cricket field may also touch parks border, but shall not lie outside
the park.

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first line of the input file contains three integer numbers N , W , and H, separated by spaces.
N (0  N  100) is the number of trees in the park. W and H (1  W,H  10000) are the park width
and height in feet respectively.

Next N lines describe coordinates of trees in the park. Each line contains two integer numbers Xi
and Yi separated by a space (0  Xi  W , 0  Yi  H) that represent coordinates of i-th tree. All
trees are located at different coordinates.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1312  Cricket Field 2/2

Write to the output file a single line with three integer numbers P , Q, and L separated by spaces,
where (P,Q) are coordinates of the cricket field Southwestern corner, and L is a length of its sides. If
there are multiple possible field locations with a maximum size, then output any one.

Note: This is a sample input and output that corresponds to the park plan that is shown on the
picture.
