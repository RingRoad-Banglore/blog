title: Uva 01616  Caravan Robbers
---


## Input

```text

Long long ago in a far far away land there were two great cities and The Great Caravan Road between
them. Many robber gangs worked on that road.

By an old custom the i-th band robbed all merchants that dared to travel between ai and bi miles
of The Great Caravan Road. The custom was old, but a clever one, as there were no two distinct i
and j such that ai  aj and bj  bi. Still when intervals controlled by two gangs intersected, bloody
fights erupted occasionally. Gang leaders decided to end those wars. They decided to assign each gang
a new interval such that all new intervals do not intersect (to avoid bloodshed), for each gang their
new interval is subinterval of the old one (to respect the old custom), and all new intervals are of equal
length (to keep things fair).

You are hired to compute the maximal possible length of an interval that each gang would control
after redistribution.

## Output

```text
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line contains n (1  n  100000)  the number of gangs. Each of the next n lines contains

information about one of the gangs  two integer numbers ai and bi (0  ai < bi  1000000). Data
provided in the input file conforms to the conditions laid out in the problem statement.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, write to the output on a line by itself.
Output the maximal possible length of an interval in miles as an irreducible fraction p/q.

Note for the sample:

In the above example, one possible set of new intervals that each gang would control after redistri-
bution is given below.

 The first gang would control an interval between 7/2 = 3.5 and 12/2 = 6 miles which has length
of 5/2 and is a subinterval of its original (2, 6).

 The second gang would control an interval between 2/2 = 1 and 7/2 = 3.5 miles which has length
of 5/2 and is a subinterval of its original (1, 4).

 The third gang would control an interval between 16/2 = 8 and 21/2 = 10.5 miles which has
length of 5/2 and is a subinterval of its original (8, 12).
