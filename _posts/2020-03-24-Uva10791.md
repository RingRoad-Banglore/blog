title: Uva 10791  Minimum Sum LCM
---


## Input

```text
LCM (Least Common Multiple) of a set of integers is defined as the minimum number, which is a
multiple of all integers of that set. It is interesting to note that any positive integer can be expressed
as the LCM of a set of positive integers. For example 12 can be expressed as the LCM of 1, 12 or
12, 12 or 3, 4 or 4, 6 or 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.

In this problem, you will be given a positive integer N .
You have to find out a set of at least two positive integers
whose LCM is N . As infinite such sequences are possible,
you have to pick the sequence whose summation of elements
is minimum. We will be quite happy if you just print the
summation of the elements of this set. So, for N = 12, you
should print 4+3 = 7 as LCM of 4 and 3 is 12 and 7 is
the minimum possible summation.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 100 test cases. Each test
case consists of a positive integer N (1  N  231  1).

Input is terminated by a case where N = 0. This case
should not be processed. There can be at most 100 test
cases.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output of each test case should consist of a line starting with Case #:  where # is the test case
number. It should be followed by the summation as specified in the problem statement. Look at the
output for sample input for details.

```

## Sample Output

```text
12
10
