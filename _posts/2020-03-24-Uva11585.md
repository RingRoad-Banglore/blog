## Input

```text

At least its not a sudoku problem

The puzzle Nurikabe is played on a grid. Initially, each
grid space is either blank or contains a single number. The
goal is to shade in some of the blank spaces to satisfy the
following constraints:

 Any two shaded spaces are connected by some se-
quence of adjacent shaded spaces. Two spaces are
called adjacent if they share a side.

 For each of the unshaded spaces b, let Wb be the col-
lection of all unshaded spaces that can be reached
from b by a sequence of adjacent unshaded spaces.
Then, Wb contains exactly one numbered space and
that number is exactly the number of spaces in Wb.

 For any unshaded space b, there is a sequence of un-
shaded spaces starting at b and ending at a space on
the edge of the grid where consecutive spaces in this
sequence share a side or a corner.

 Finally, in every 2 2 subsquare there is at least one
unshaded space.

The image shows an example of a Nurikabe puzzle and its solution. Take care to verify all four
constraints are satisfied in the solution. To help you understand the third constraint, note that the
middle cell containing the number 1 can reach the edge of the grid since it shares a corner with a group
of unshaded spaces containing the number 2.

Example Nurikabe

It is known that the problem of determining if a Nurikabe grid can be shaded to satisfy the con-
straints is NP-complete. Your task is much easier. Given an initial grid and a proposed shading,
determine if the shading satisfies the constraints of the Nurikabe puzzle.

## Output

```text
Input begins with a single integer t that indicates the number of grids to verify. The first line of each
case contains three integers r, c, d where the grid has r rows and c columns (1  r, c  100). Then, d
lines follow, each containing three integers r, c, n meaning the grid cell at location (r, c) contains the
positive number n. The upper-left grid space has coordinates (0,0), no space receives more than one
number, and no two numbered grid spaces will share an edge. Finally, the shading data is specified by
r strings of c characters each (one string per line). The j-th character in the i-th row of the shading
data is # if the cell with coordinates (i, j) is shaded and . if that cell is not shaded.

Each test case is preceded by a blank line.
