title: Uva 00748  Exponentiation

## Input

```text
Problems involving the computation of exact values of very large magnitude and precision are common.
For example, the computation of the national debt is a taxing experience for many computer systems.

This problem requires that you write a program to compute the exact value of Rn where R is a real
number (0.0 < R < 99.999) and n is an integer such that 0 < n  25.
```

## Output

```text
The input will consist of a set of pairs of values for R and n. The R value will occupy columns 1
through 6, and the n value will be in columns 8 and 9.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output will consist of one line for each line of input giving the exact value of Rn. Leading zeros
and insignificant trailing zeros should be suppressed in the output.

```

## Sample Output

```text
95.123 12
0.4321 20
5.1234 15
6.7592 9
98.999 10
1.0100 12

```
