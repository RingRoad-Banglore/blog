title: Uva 12123  Magnetic Train Tracks
---


## Input

```text
The rail roads of Japan are being redesigned. So the
governent is planning to install ultra-modern Mag-
netic trains instead of the current normal trains. As
fuel price have gone high and nations have shut down
their nuclear plants so the price of electricity/battery
is also sky high. To reduce power consumption the
Japanese government is trying to descourage people
from riding trains  as a result the ticket price is also
kept sky high and it is strictly proportional to the
square of the distance between two stations.

All the trains move in clockwise or counter clock-
wise order in a closed triangular track. These trian-
gular tracks can be formed by connecting any three
stations in clockwise or counterclockwise order. For
simplicity you can assume that a station is denoted by a point in a two dimensional Cartesian Coor-
dinate system. But these triangular tracks and ticket pricing policy can create new troubles. As the
ticket price between two stations is proportional to the square of the distance, people often avoid the
shortest route to destination and rather choose the longer one through another station. This causes
more electricity expense per passenger and creates unwanted crowd in the stations. So the government
would prefer not to make such tracks.

Figure 1: The figure above shows 6 places. It also shows all
possible triangular tracks (not necessarily valid site) by

connecting them. The green track is one invalid track site,
on the other hand the red track is one valid track site.

There are five other valid track sites in the above figure.

For example in the figure on the left
you can see a closed triangular track
marked with green. If someone wants to
go from station D to station E he can go
directly by riding a clockwise train or can
go via station C by riding a counter clock-
wise train: That is he first buys ticket
from station D to C and then he buys
ticket of station C to E. But in the cur-
rent ticket pricing system the route via
C (which is also much longer) will be
cheaper. So this site CED is not a place
to build a track. For the similar reasons
AEB is a valid site for building track.
On a valid track the shortest distance be-
tween any two stations is also the unique
cheapest route between them. Given the
coordinate of all stations you will have to
find the number of sites (a group of three
places) for valid tracks.

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 15 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with an n (2 < n < 1201) which denotes the number of stations. Each of the next
n lines contains two integer xi, yi (0  xi, yi  10000) which denotes the Cartesian coordinate of the

i-th station.
You can assume that a track can be built via through any three stations, no three places will be

collinear to avoid the problem of degenerate tracks and the connecting railroad between two stations
can always be represented by the straight line connecting them.

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce two line of output. The first line contains the serial of output and the
second line displays the total number of sites where a track can be built. Look at the output for sample
input for details.
