title: Uva 12742  Mining in Starcraft
---


## Input

```

In Star Craft, there are two main resources: minerals and vespene gas (gas for short).

You can ask SCVs to mine minerals and collect gas.

 If a mineral command is given to an SCV, it can get 8 units of minerals after t1 unit time.

 If a gas command is given to an SCV, it can get 8 units of gas after t2 unit time.

You can only give a command to an SCV after its previous command is finished.

You can build new SCVs, each costing 50 units of mineral and takes t3 unit time. Those minerals
are consumed at the beginning of the process, and you can build at most one SCV at a time (i.e. you
cannot start building another SCV before the previous SCV is finished).

Initially, you have 50 units of minerals and 4 SCVs. Your task is to have at least p1 units of minerals
and at least p2 units of gas, as soon as possible.
```

## Output

```
Each test case contains 5 integers t1, t2, t3, p1, p2 (1  t1, t2, t3  10, 0  p1, p2  100). The last case
is followed by t1 = t2 = t3 = p1 = p2 = 0, which should not be processed. There will be at most 1000
test cases, all are randomly generated.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the shortest time T in the first line, followed by the plan (if multiple optimal
plans exist, any will do). Each line in the plan has 3 kinds of format:

 t 0  build a new SCV at time t

 t i 1  give mineral command to the i-th SCV.

 t i 2  give gas command to the i-th SCV.

Print a blank line after each test case, including the last test case.

SCVs are numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . Initial SCVs are numbered 1..4, newly built SCVs are numbered in
the same order theyre built.

Important: At time T , all the SCVs must be idle, and there should be no SCV being built.
