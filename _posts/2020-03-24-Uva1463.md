title: Uva 01463  Largest Empty Circle on a Segment
---


## Input

```text

We are given N line segments on the 2D plane. We want to find the maximum radius of an empty
circle whose center coordinates (xc, yc) are constrained as follows:

 0  xc  L

 yc = 0

A circle is empty if no part of a segment is located strictly inside of it (thus, a segment may touch
the circle, but may not intersect with the interior of the circle).
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains the number of test cases T . The test cases are described next.
The first line of a test case contains the integer numbers N and L (1  N  2000 and 0  L  10000).
The next N lines of the test case contain 4 integers each, describing the coordinates of the endpoints of
a segment: xa, ya, xb and yb. The coordinates of the endpoints of the segment are (xa, ya) and (xb, yb).
All the coordinates are between -20000 and +20000. Every two consecutive numbers on the same line
are separated by a single blank.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print a line containing a real number R, denoting the maximum radius of an empty
circle whose center obeys the constraints. The number must be printed with 3 decimal digits (the
number must be rounded up or down according to the usual rounding rules).

Note: The picture on the right corresponds to the sample input below.

## Sample Output

```text

4 10

1 1 10 3

5 3 9 1

3 1 4 1

8 3 11 -3
