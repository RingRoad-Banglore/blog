## Input

```
You and your friend are playing a 2 player game. The game is played in a graph of V vertices. The
vertices are numbered from 0 to V  1. The graph has some directed edges. But the graph does not
contain any cycles or loops. The rule of the game is as follows.

1. Initially vertex i has a positive value valuei

2. Both players make their moves by turns. In his turn the player chooses a vertex with the following
properties.

 The value of the vertex is strictly positive.
 The vertex has one or more outgoing edges.

If there is no such vertex the player loses and the game terminates.

3. If the player can select a vertex the player will decrease the value of the selected vertex i by 1.
Then from the set of vertices which have an incoming edge from vertex i, the player will select Ki
(this value will be given as input) vertices and increase the value of those vertices by 1. Among
these selected Ki vertices there can be duplicated vertices. And if a vertex is selected n times its
value will be increased by 1 every time. Or in another word its value will be increased by n. For
example if the Ki = 6 and the selected vertex set is {2,2,2,3,3,5} then value2 will be increased by
3, value3 will be increased by 2 and value5 will be increased by 1.

Now consider the graph on the right.
Let the values of K be {2,1,3,2}.
Now the value set {0,0,0,5} is a losing terminating position because the

player cannot select any vertex which have outgoing edges and positive values.
For the value set {3,4,5,6} the current player can go to the following value

states by 1 move.

 {2,5,6,6}  select the vertex 0, decrease its value by 1. And increase both of 1 and 2 by 1. Here
K0 = 2.

 {2,6,5,6}  select the vertex 0, decrease its value by 1 and increase its adjacent 1 by 2. Here
K0 = 2.

 {2,4,7,6}  select the vertex 0, decrease its value by 1 and increase its adjacent 2 by 2. Here
K0 = 2.

 {3,3,5,7}  select the vertex 1, decrease its value by 1 and increase its adjacent 3 by 1. Here
K1 = 1.

 {3,7,4,6}  select the vertex 2, decrease its value by 1 and increase its adjacent 1 by 3. Here
K2 = 3.

 {3,5,4,8}  select the vertex 2, decrease its value by 1 and increase its adjacent 1 by 1 and 3 by
2. Here K2 = 3.

 {3,6,4,7}  select the vertex 2, decrease its value by 1 and increase its adjacent 1 by 2 and 3 by
1. Here K2 = 3.

 {3,4,4,9}  select the vertex 2, decrease its value by 1 and increase its adjacent 3 by 3. Here
K2 = 3.

Now given the graph and initial values of each of the vertices your task is to determine if the first
player wins or loses given that both players play perfectly.
```

## Output

```
Input contains multiple number of test cases. First line contains T (1  T  20) the number of
test cases. Each test case starts with a line V (2  V  100) and E (2  E  1500). V is the
number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Each of the next E lines contains 2 integers FROM
(0  FROM < V ) and TO (0  TO < V ) denoting that there is a directed edge from FROM to TO.
FROM and TO will not be equal. Also each vertex will have at most 15 outgoing edges. Next
line contains V integers K0, K1, , KV1. Each of the value of K is between 1 and 100 inclusive. Next
line contains R (1  R  100) the number of rounds. There will be R round of game with this graph.
Each of the next R lines contains the description of each round. Each round consists of V integers
V alue0 V alue1 . . . V alueV1 denoting the initial value of each vertex. Each of these V aluei will be
between 1 and 100 inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output consist of R + 1 lines. First line is Game#i: where i is the game number.
Game number starts from 1. Each of the next R lines contains Round#j: RESULT  where j is the
number of round. RESULT is either WINNING when the initial values of this round is a winning
position for the first player or LOSING when the initial values of this round is a losing position for the
first player. We will assume that both players play perfectly. Print a blank line after the output of each
test case. See the output for sample input for more clarification.
