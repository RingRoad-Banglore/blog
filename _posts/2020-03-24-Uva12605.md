title: Uva 12605  Ripple Effect
---


## Input

```text
Check if a solution to a Ripple Effect puzzle is valid.

Ripple Effect is played on a rectangular grid divided
into polyominoes. A polyomino is a plane geometric figure
formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge.

The solver must place one positive integer into each cell
of the grid  some of which may be given in advance 
according to these rules:

 Every integer from 1 to the quantity of cells in a poly-
omino must appear exactly once in that polyomino.

 If two identical numbers appear in the same row or
column, at least that many cells with other numbers
must separate them.

For example, two cells both containing 1 may not
be orthogonally adjacent, but must have at least one cell between them with a different number.
Two cells marked 3 in the same row or column must have at least three cells with other numbers
between them in that row or column, and so on.

In this problem polyominoes will be of size at most 8.

## Output

```text
The input starts with a line containing an integer T (T  100), the number of test cases.
Each test case starts with two integers on a line, R and C (4  R,C  15).
R lines follow, each containing a string of C digits di (1  di  8), the description of the solution.
Next R lines will contain C integers (R  C table, we will call it descr), each describing the

corresponding cell in the puzzle (0  descr(r, c)  15).
The value of descr(r, c) is determined by the values of connections with neighbouring cells, in the

following manner:

descr(r, c) = 0
if(connected((r, c),(r  1, c)) descr(r, c)+ = 1; (UP)
if(connected((r, c),(r, c+ 1)) descr(r, c)+ = 2; (RIGHT)
if(connected((r, c),(r + 1, c)) descr(r, c)+ = 4; (DOWN)
if(connected((r, c),(r, c 1)) descr(r, c)+ = 8; (LEFT)

For example, a polyomino of size 1 (single square not connected to others) will have the value of 0
and a square that is connected only to the squares above and below will have the value of 5.

See sample input for clarification.
