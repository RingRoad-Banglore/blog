title: radionuclides

In nuclear physics, the island of stability is a predicted set of isotopes of superheavy elements that may have considerably longer half-lives than known isotopes of these elements. It is predicted to appear as an "island" in the chart of nuclides, separated from known stable and long-lived primordial radionuclides. Its theoretical existence is attributed to stabilizing effects of predicted magic numbers of protons and neutrons in the superheavy mass region.
 

***Deformed nuclei:***

Though nuclei within the island of stability around N = 184 are predicted to be spherical, studies from the early 1990sâ€”beginning with Polish physicists Zygmunt Patyk and Adam Sobiczewski in 1991.
The half-lives of nuclei in the island of stability itself are unknown since none of the nuclides that would be "on the island" have been observed. Many physicists believe that the half-lives of these nuclei are relatively short, on the order of minutes or days.
