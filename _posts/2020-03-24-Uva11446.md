title: Uva 11446  Where is the back button
---


## Input

```
The employees of the Dendrogram Workless Inc. do their tasks through a local intranet application with
web page like interface. Every single worker has a designated homepage with all his tasks. According to
the companys new security policy, no worker is allowed to visit any other personnels homepage. But
the old pages might contain some links to other pages (or even a link to itself.) Instead of removing
links from working pages, they introduce a new web browser without the back button and make the
employees use this new browser. The idea is, no employee can leave his designated page because without
a back button there is no assurance that a worker will find a path to return to his home page just
when the boss comes in! The employees soon get bored and decide that they would like to visit other
pages. So, they plan to insert new links as necessary to their pages so that every single employee can
return to his home page after clicking one or more links without using the back button. You are to
help them by finding the minimum number of links to insert.
```

## Output

The first line of the input states the number of test cases in the input. Each test case begins with
two integers The number of pages in the system, P (1  P  20) and The number of links, L
(0  L  (P  (P  1)/2)). The pages are denoted by integers from 0 to P  1. Each of the next L
lines contains two integers A and B (0  A,B  P  1) implying that page A has a link to page B.
