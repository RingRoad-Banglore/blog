title: Uva 11550  Demanding Dilemma
---


```
A simple undirected graph is an ordered pair G = (V,E) where V is a non-empty set of vertices, and
E is a set of unordered pairs (u, v) where u and v are in V and u = v. If S is a set, define |S| as the
size of S. An incidence matrix M is a |V |  |E| matrix where M(i, j) is 1 if edge j is incident to vertex
i (edge j is either (i, u) or (u, i)) and 0 otherwise.

Given an n  m matrix, can it be an incidence matrix of a simple undirected graph G = (V,E)
where |V | = n and |E| = m?
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains an integer t (1  t  41), the number of test cases.

Each test case starts with a line with two integers n (1  n  8) and m (0  m  n(n  1)/2).
Then n lines containing m integers (0s or 1s) each follow such that the j-th number on the i-th line
is M(i, j).

```

## Output

```
For each test case print Yes if the incidence matrix given in the input can be an incidence matrix of
some simple undirected graph, otherwise print No.
