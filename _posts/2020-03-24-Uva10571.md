## Input

```text
Peter takes part in a computational mathematics contest. The last round consists of the following
problem.

Given an array N  N . A positive integer is written besides each column and row. Let Xi be a
number written near a column i, and Yj a number written near a column j. In order to be a winner a
few numbers should be put in the array. Moreover, its absolutely necessary to follow all the conditions
described lower:

1. No two numbers in the array may be equal.

2. Each column and each row must contain exactly two numbers.

3. The product of the numbers of i-th column must be equal to Xi.

4. The product of the numbers of j-th row must be equal to Yj

Figure 1 shows the example of a solution of such a problem.

Please! Help Peter.

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases. The description of each test case is given below:

The first line of each test case contains N (2  N  10). The second line contains N numbers,
X1, X2, . . . , XN (1  Xi  1000 for all 1  i  N). The third line contains N numbers Y1, Y2, . . . , YN
(1  Yi  1000 for all 1  i  N).

Input is terminated by a case whose N = 0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The description of output for each test case is given below:

For each set of input print the (N N) grid after placing the numbers in it. The array should be
printed by lines: first N numbers of the first row, then N numbers of the second row, etc. If the cell
has a number  print it; however, if it does not  print just 0. All the numbers should be separated by
blanks and/or new line symbols. Its not necessary to care about nice array. If there are many solutions,
find just one of it. Its guaranteed that at least one solution will always exist.

Print a blank line after the output for each set of input.
