title: Uva 00809  Bullet Hole
---


## Input

```
A cube is suspended in space. A
Cartesian coordinate system is de-
fined with its origin at one of the
bottom corners of the cube, as
shown in the figure. The cube
has side dimension d, so its op-
posite corners are at coordinates
(0, 0, 0) and (d, d, d). The positive
z-direction of the coordinate sys-
tem is up with respect to gravity.

The interior of the cube con-
tains partitions with uniform spac-
ing in each dimension, so that the
cube is partitioned into n3 mini-
cubes of equal size. The partitions are thin and watertight, and each mini-cube is filled with water.
The total volume of water in all the minicubes is d3 .

A gun fires a bullet which may hit the cube. The muzzle of the gun is at the point (x1, y1, z1). The
point (x2, y2, z2) is a point on the bullets path that defines the direction of the bullet. The bullet does
not shatter the cube, but wherever the bullet touches a side or interior partition of the cube, it makes a
small hole. Bullet holes may be made in the sides, edges, or corners of the interior mini-cubes. Water,
influenced by gravity, may leak through these small holes. All the water that leaks out of the large
cube is collected and measured.

## Output

```
The input data set consists of several trials. Each trial is described by eight integers. The first
integer is n (n  50), as described above. The second integer is d (d  100). The remain-
ing six integersx1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2represent the origin and a point on the path of the bullet
(100  x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2  100). The origin and the point on the path of the bullet are not
the same. The origin may be inside the cube. After the last trial, the integer 0 terminates the data
set.

## Sample Input

```
Your program must compute the total volume of water that leaks out of the large cube. For each trial,
print the trial number, the notation Volume =, and the total volume of water accurate to two digits
to the right of the decimal point.

Print a blank line between trials.
Note: In this problem, two real numbers are considered equal if they are less than 106 apart.
