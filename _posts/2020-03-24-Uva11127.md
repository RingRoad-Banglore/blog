title: Uva 11127  TripleFree Binary Strings
---


```
A binary string consists of ones and zeros. Given a binary string T , if there is no binary string S such
that SSS (concatenate three copies of S together) is a substring of T , we say T is triple-free.

A pattern consists of ones, zeros and asterisks, where an asterisk() can be replaced by either one
or zero. For example, the pattern 0**1 contains strings 0001, 0011, 0101, 0111, but not 1001 or 0000.

Given a pattern P , how many triple-free binary strings does it contain?
```

## Input

```
Each line of the input represents a test case, which contains the length of pattern, n (0 < n < 31), and
the pattern P . There can be maximum 35 test cases.

The input terminates when n = 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the answer, shown below.

```

## Sample Input

```
4 0**1
5 *****
10 **01**01**
0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 2
Case 2: 16
Case 3: 9
```
