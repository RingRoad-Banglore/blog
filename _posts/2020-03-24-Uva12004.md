title: Uva 12004  Bubble Sort
---


## Input

```text
Check the following code which counts the number of swaps of bubble sort.

int findSwaps( int n, int a[] )
{

int count = 0, i, j, temp, b[100000];

for( i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {
b[i] = a[i];

}
for( i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {

for( j = 0; j < n - 1; j++ ) {
if( b[j] > b[j+1] ) {

temp = b[j];
b[j] = b[j+1];
b[j+1] = temp;

count++;
}

}
}
return count;

}

You have to find the average value of count in the given code if we run findSwaps() infinitely
many times using constant n and each time some random integers (from 1 to n) are given in array
a[]. You can assume that the input integers in array a[] are distinct.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 1000), denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains an
integer n (1  n  105) in a single line.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number and the desired result. If the result is an integer, print it. Otherwise
print it in p/q form, where p and q are relative prime.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
1
2

```
