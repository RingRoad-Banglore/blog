title: Uva 10304  Optimal Binary Search Tree
---


```
Given a set S = (e1, e2, ..., en) of n distinct elements such that e1 < e2 < . . . < en and considering a
binary search tree (see the previous problem) of the elements of S, it is desired that higher the query
frequency of an element, closer will it be to the root.

The cost of accessing an element ei of S in a tree (cost(ei)) is equal to the number of edges in the
path that connects the root with the node that contains the element. Given the query frequencies of the
elements of S, (f(e1), f(e2), . . . , f(en)), we say that the total cost of a tree is the following summation:

f(e1)  cost(e1) + f(e2)  cost(e2) + . . .+ f(en)  cost(en)

In this manner, the tree with the lowest total cost is the one with the best representation for
searching elements of S. Because of this, it is called the Optimal Binary Search Tree.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several instances, one per line.

Each line will start with a number 1  n  250, indicating the size of S. Following n, in the
same line, there will be n non-negative integers representing the query frequencies of the elements of
S: f(e1), f(e2), . . . , f(en), 0  f(ei)  100. Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Output

```
For each instance of the input, you must print a line in the output with the total cost of the Optimal
Binary Search Tree.
