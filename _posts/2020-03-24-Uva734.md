title: Uva 00734  The Programmers Hex
---


## Input

```text

Figure 1 Figure 2

The goal of this problem is to solve a puzzle that
consists of 7 hexagonally-shaped pieces of wood (from
now on referred to simply as hexagons) that can be
placed on 7 pegs that are mounted on a wooden base.
The pegs are arranged in the pattern shown in Figure
1. Notice that we have numbered the pegs (0 through
6) in order to facilitate this discussion. The hexagons
are labeled with the capital letters A through G
(see figure 2 for one example). An integer (between
0 and 9, inclusive) is printed adjacent to each edge of
each hexagon.

You will notice that when 7 hexagons are placed on the 7 pegs that 3 edges of each of the outer
hexagons and all edges of the hexagon on peg 0 are adjacent to an edge of some other hexagon. In
order to solve the puzzle you must find an arrangement and orientation of all 7 hexagons so that the
numbers associated with each edge that is adjacent to some other edge equals the number associated
with that other edge. (See Figure 3).

Figure 3 - Overhead View of a Solved Puzzle

The program must read a description of seven
hexagons from the input file, find a solution to the
puzzle using those 7 hexagons (if one exists), and
write to the output file a description of the puzzles
solution. If more than one solution exists, you may
choose any one of them (Obviously, once a solution
is found, one could rotate the hexagon on peg 0 and
move the other hexagons around to find other closely-
related solutions.) If no solution exists, your program
should report same by writing an appropriate mes-
sage to the output file. After solving the puzzle for
one set of hexagon solutions, your program should
read the next set, solve the new puzzle, and continue
until the end-of-file is detected in the input file.
```

## Output

```text
As stated above the input file contains several sets
of hexagon descriptions. The first 7 lines in the file
contain 6 digits on each line (no spaces). These digits
represent the integers that are printed on the 6 sides of each hexagon. The first line contains the integers
printed on the hexagon labeled A. The second line corresponds to hexagon B, and so forth through
line 7 that corresponds to hexagon G. The first digit on each line corresponds to the integer printed on
the edge that is initially in the 12 OClock position that well call TOP. The next 5 digits are the
numbers on the edges as you proceed in a clockwise fashion from the edge that is TOP. For example
the hexagon in figure 2 on the previous page could be represented by the data line: 123456. As you
can see in figure 3, the edges of a given hexagon do NOT necessarily have unique integers.

After the 7 lines that describe a given set of hexagons, there is a line that contains a single asterisk
(*) in column 1 which is used as a delimiter between sets of hexagon. After finding a solution for the

current set of hexagons, and until the end-of-file is detected, your program should read the next 7 lines
that represent a new set of hexagons and a new puzzle that should be solved. The asterisk follows every
set, including the final one.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output file should contain a description of a solution for each set of hexagons given in the input
file. A solution description consists of reporting which hexagon should be placed on peg 0, peg 1, peg 2,
... and peg 6. In addition it is necessary that the report describe the orientation of each hexagon. Thus
the output should consists of a 3 column report. Column 1 is a list of the pegs 0 through 6. Column
2 is a list of the letters that represent the hexagons that should be placed on peg 0, peg 1, ... and
peg 6, in that order. Column 3 is a list of the edge numbers for the hexagon listed in column 2. The
digits should begin with the edge that is in the TOP position when the puzzle is solved. The next 5
digits should correspond to the edges as you proceed in a clockwise fashion. Each column should have
a heading. The first columns heading should be PEG. The heading for column 2 should be HEX. The
third heading should be POSITION.

If there is no solution for a particular set of hexagons, print the message: No solution possible.
Write a line of 36 asterisks * to the output file after each solution description (or No solution
message) in order to separate the output for one puzzle from the next.

Note: The first sample case corresponds to the puzzle and solution shown in Figure 3.
