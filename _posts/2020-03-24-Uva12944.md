title: Uva 12944  Earthquake Disaster
---


## Input

```
An earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 on the Richter scale has just occurred in Seismicity. Houses
collapsed, many people are homeless and food becomes scarce. Now, it is time for the rest of the country
to help. The country has N cities, numbered from 1 to N , being the city N Seismicity.

Each city has a maximum number of tons of basic goods (water, food, blankets, clothing, medicine)
it can donate, and these basic goods will be transported to Seismicity in truck containers through the
national road network. Each road is bidirectional and connects two cities. Additionally, if government
decides to use a road to move trucks along it, it must pay a compensation to the road neighbors because
of contamination and noise, and no more than a fixed number of tons can be transported over it.

Your task is to compute the maximum number of tons of basic goods that can be taken from other
cities to Seismicity and the minimum amount of money to be paid to road neighbors to achieve it.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two blank-separated
integers N and M , where N is the number of cities (2  N  20), and M is the number of roads
(1  M  500). Then N  1 lines follow, each one containing an integer ti indicating the maximum
number of tons of basic goods that the city i can donate (0  ti  50, for each 1  i  N  1). Each
of the next M lines contains four blank-separated integers a, b, w and c, indicating that there is a
road between cities a and b over which no more than w tons can be transported at a cost of c per ton
(1  a < b  N , 1  w  50, 1  c  50). Note that all roads are bidirectional, and that there may be
several roads between any two fixed cities.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the maximum number of tons of basic goods that can be taken from other
cities to Seismicity, followed by the minimum amount of money to be paid to road neighbors to achieve
it.
