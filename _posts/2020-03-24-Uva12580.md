title: Uva 12580  Yell Classico
---


```
The Old Yellers, the contestants of the old days of IIUC are going to have a football match with the
current contestants. As the yellers are going to be the host of the match, it will be called Yell Classico.
As the yellers are always busy in yelling, oops, I mean programming, they have appointed you as the
manager of their team. Now, as a manager of the Yeller team, you have to select 11 players for the
match from N players.

All the N players will stand in a line just before the match. Your task will be to select 11 players
from them in such a way that, the player standing in front is as tall as possible. If there are more than
one such team formations, do it in a way where the 2nd player is as tall as possible. If still there is a
tie, choose the formation having tallest player in the 3rd position and so on. (Which means, until
you can break the tie or reach the 11th position, keep looking in the next position).

Note that,

1. You dont have enough time to change the order in which players are standing.

2. If you have tie even after reaching the 11th position, select from any of the tied formations.

Players are quite same in their playing abilities, you dont need to bother about that.

## Output

Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12580  Yell Classico 2/2

From them, you can not select the 1st team-formation because it has a player with height 2 in front,
but other formations have a taller player of height 6 in front.

Now, there is a tie, because, all the other formations have a player of same height (6) in front. So,
now you will have to look for the formation which has the tallest player in next (2nd) position. For
this case, it is the second one (having a player of height 3) and there is no tie for this position. So, the
team-formation you will select is 6 3 8 7 2 5 3 4 3 5 10.
