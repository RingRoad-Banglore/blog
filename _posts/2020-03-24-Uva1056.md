title: Uva 01056  Degrees of Separation
---


## Input

```text
In our increasingly interconnected world, it has been speculated that everyone on Earth is related to
everyone else by no more than six degrees of separation. In this problem, you must write a program to
find the maximum degree of separation for a network of people.

For any two people, the degree of separation is the minimum number of relationships that must be
traversed to connect the two people. For a network, the maximum degree of separation is the largest
degree of separation between any two people in the network. If there is a pair of people in the network
who are not connected by a chain of relationships, the network is disconnected.

As shown below, a network can be described as a set of symmetric relationships each of which
connects two people. A line represents a relationship between two people. Network A illustrates a
network with 2 as the maximum degree of separation. Network B is disconnected.

Network A: Max. degree of separation = 2 Network B: Disconnected
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of data sets that describe networks of people. For each data set, the first line has
two integers: P (2  P  50), the number of people in the network, and R (R  1), the number of
network relationships. Following that first line are R relationships. Each relationship consists of two
strings that are names of people in the network who are related. Names are unique and contain no
blank spaces. Because a person may be related to more than one other person, a name may appear
multiple times in a data set.

The final test case is followed by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each network, display the network number followed by the maximum degree of separation. If the
network is disconnected, display DISCONNECTED. Display a blank line after the output for each network.
Use the format illustrated in the sample output.
