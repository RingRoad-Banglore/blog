title: Uva 11861  Explosion
---


## Input

```
Planet Krypton is about to explode. The inhabitants
of this planet have to leave the planet immediately.
But the problem is that, still some decisions have to
be made  where to go, how to go etc. So, the council
of Krypton has invited some of the people to meet in
a large hall.

There are n people in planet Krypton, for sim-
plicity they are given ids from 1 to n. The council
uses a super computer  Oracle to call them in the
meeting.

Oracle has four types of messages for invitation.
The message format is type x y, where x and y are
two different persons ids and type is an integer as
follows

 1 x y means that either x or y should be present in the meeting.

 2 x y means that if x is present, then no condition on y, but if x is absent y should be absent.

 3 x y means that either x or y must be absent.

 4 x y means that either x or y must be present but not both.

Each member of the council has an opinion too. The message format is type x y, where x, y and
z are three different persons ids and type is an integer as follows

 1 x y z means that at least one of x, y or z should be present

 2 x y z means that at least one of x, y or z should be absent

Now you have to find whether the members can be invited such that every message by oracle and
the council members are satisfied.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with in integer T ( 200) denoting number of cases.

Each case starts with a blank line. Next line contains 3 integers n, m and k (3  n  1000,
0  m  2000, 0  k  5) where m means the number of messages by oracle, k means the total
members in the council. Each of the next m lines will contain a message of Oracle in the format given
above. Each of the next k lines will contain a message of a council member. You can assume that all
the ids given are correct.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and whether its possible to invite the people such that all the
messages are satisfied. If its not possible, then print Impossible. in a single line. Otherwise, print
Possible and the number of invited people and the Ids of invited people in ascending order. Print
the line leaving a single space between fields. Terminate this line with a .. See the samples for details.
There can be multiple answers; print any valid one.
