## Input

```
You work at a company that produces circular plates. In a meeting, your boss announces a new mar-
keting plan  the company will package the plates in specially shaped containers, so as to attract
customers attention. The specially shaped containers will always be convex polygon. The existing
packaging software can easily compute the maximum plate size for a given container size, but unfortu-
nately, it can only do so for rectangular containers. Therefore, your boss asks you to write a program
that can compute the maximum plate size given the containers shape.

The above figure shows a maximum plate placed inside a convex-polygon-shaped container.
Given the shape of a container, you need to compute the radius of the largest possible plate which

can be fitted inside the container?
```

## Output

```
Input consists of multiple problem instances. Each instance begins with a single positive integer n,
where 3  n  50. It is followed by 2n integers, x1, y1, x2, y2, . . . , xn, yn, where 1000  xi, yi  1000
for all i. They indicate the shape of a container which is a simple convex polygon with n vertices
(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn) in counter-clockwise order. The area of the polygon is guaranteed to be
positive and no three consecutive vertices are collinear. The input data is terminated by an n being 0.
There will not be more than 100 test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print out the radius of the largest possible plate which can be fitted inside the input
container. The answer should be printed with 3 digits after the decimal point in a single line.
