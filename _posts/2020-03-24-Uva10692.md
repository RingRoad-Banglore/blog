title: Uva 10692  Huge Mod

```
The operator for exponentiation is different
from the addition, subtraction, multiplication
or division operators in the sense that the de-
fault associativity for exponentiation goes right
to left instead of left to right. So unless we mess
it up by placing parenthesis, 232 should mean
2(3

2) = 29 = 512 not (23)2 = 82 = 64 . This leads to the obvious fact that if we take the levels of
exponents higher (i.e., 23453), the numbers can become quite big. But lets not make life miserable.
We being the good guys would force the ultimate value to be no more than 10000.

Given a1, a2, a3, . . . , aN and m(= 10000) you only need to compute a1 a2 a3. . . aN mod m.
```

## Input

```
There can be multiple (not more than 100) test cases. Each test case will be presented in a single line.
The first line of each test case would contain the value for M (2  M  10000). The next number of
that line would be N (1  N  10). Then N numbers  the values for a1, a2, a3, . . . , aN would follow.
You can safely assume that 1  ai  1000. The end of input is marked by a line containing a single
hash (#) mark.

```

## Output

```
For each of the test cases, print the test case number followed by the value of a1 a2 a3. . . aN mod m
on one line. The sample output shows the exact format for printing the test case number.

```

## Sample Input

```
10 4 2 3 4 5
100 2 5 2
53 3 2 3 2
#

```

## Sample Output

```
Case #1: 2
Case #2: 25
Case #3: 35
```
