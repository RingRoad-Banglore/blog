title: Uva 00750  8 Queens Chess Problem
---


```

In chess it is possible to place eight queens on the board so that no one queen can be taken by any
other. Write a program that will determine all such possible arrangements for eight queens given the
initial position of one of the queens.

Do not attempt to write a program which evaluates every possible 8 configuration of 8 queens placed
on the board. This would require 88 evaluations and would bring the system to its knees. There will
be a reasonable run time constraint placed on your program.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains the number of datasets, and
its followed by a blank line.

Each dataset contains a pair of positive integers separated by
a single space. The numbers represent the square on which one
of the eight queens must be positioned. A valid square will be
represented; it will not be necessary to validate the input.

To standardize our notation, assume that the upper left-most
corner of the board is position (1,1). Rows run horizontally and
the top row is row 1. Columns are vertical and column 1 is
the left-most column. Any reference to a square is by row then
column; thus square (4,6) means row 4, column 6.

Each dataset is separated by a blank line.

```

## Output

```
Output for each dataset will consist of a one-line-per-solution representation.
Each solution will be sequentially numbered 1 . . . N . Each solution will consist of 8 numbers. Each

of the 8 numbers will be the ROW coordinate for that solution. The column coordinate will be indicated
by the order in which the 8 numbers are printed. That is, the first number represents the ROW in
which the queen is positioned in column 1; the second number represents the ROW in which the queen
is positioned in column 2, and so on.

Notes:
The sample input below produces 4 solutions. The full 88 representation of each solution is shown

below.

DO NOT SUBMIT THE BOARD MATRICES AS PART OF YOUR SOLUTION!
