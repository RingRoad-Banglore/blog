Mr. Kim is planning to open a new restaurant. His city is
laid out as a grid with size M M . Therefore, every road
is horizontal or vertical and the horizontal roads (resp., the
vertical roads) are numbered from 0 to M  1. For prof-
itability, all restaurants are located near road junctions.
The city has two big apartments which are located on the
same horizontal road. The figure below shows an example
of a city map with size 1111. A circle represents an exist-
ing restaurant and a circle labeled with A or B represents
the location of an apartment. Notice that a restaurant is
already located at each apartment. Each road junction is
represented by the coordinate of the ordered pair of a ver-
tical road and a horizontal road. The distance between two
locations (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is computed as |x1  x2|+ |y1  y2|. In the figure below, the coordinates
of A and B are (0, 5) and (10, 5), respectively.

Mr. Kim knows that the residents of the two apartments frequently have a meeting. So, he thinks
that the best location of a new restaurant is halfway between two apartments. Considering lease
expenses and existing restaurants, however, he cant select the optimal location unconditionally. Hence
he decides to regard a location satisfying the following condition as a good place. Let dist(p, q) be the
distance between p and q.

A location p is a good place if for each existing restaurants location q, dist(p,A) < dist(q, A)
or dist(p,B) < dist(q,B). In other words, p is not a good place if there exists an existing
restaurants location q such that dist(p,A)  dist(q, A) and dist(p,B)  dist(q,B).

In the above figure, the location (7, 4) is a good place. But the location p = (4, 6) is not good
because there is no apartment which is closer to p than the restaurant at q = (3, 5), i.e., dist(p,A) =
5  dist(q, A) = 3 and dist(p,B) = 7  dist(q,B) = 7. Also, the location (0, 0) is not good due to
the restaurant at (0, 5). Notice that the existing restaurants are positioned regardless of Mr. Kims
condition.

Given n locations of existing restaurants, write a program to compute the number of good places
for a new restaurant.

## Input

```
Your program is to read the input from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number
of test cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing two
integers M and n (2  M  60, 000 and 2  n  50, 000), which represent the size of a city map and
the number of existing restaurants, respectively. The (i+1)-th line of a test case contains two integers
xi and yi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n and 0  xi, yi < M), which represents the coordinate of the i-th existing
restaurant. Assume that all restaurants have distinct coordinates and that the two apartments A and
B are positioned at the locations of 1-st restaurant and 2-nd restaurant. Notice that A and B are placed
on the same horizontal line.
