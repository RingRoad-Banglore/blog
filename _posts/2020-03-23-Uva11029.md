11029 Leading and Trailing
Apart from the novice programmers, all others know that you can’t exactly represent numbers raised
to some high power. For example, the C function pow(125456, 455) can be represented in double data
type format, but you won’t get all the digits of the result. However we can get at least some satisfaction
if we could know few of the leading and trailing digits. This is the requirement of this problem.

## Input
The first line of input will be an integer T < 1001, where T represents the number of test cases. Each
of the next T lines contains two positive integers, n and k. n will fit in 32 bit integer and k will be less
than 10000001.

## Output
For each line of input there will be one line of output. It will be of the format LLL . . . TTT , where LLL
represents the first three digits of nk and TTT represents the last three digits of nk. You are assured
that nk will contain at least 6 digits.

## Sample Input
<p>2</p><p>123456 1</p><p>123456 2</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>123...456</p><p>152...936</p>
