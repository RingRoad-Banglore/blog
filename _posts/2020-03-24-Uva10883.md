Do you know how to compute the mean (or average) of n numbers? Well, thats not good enough
for me. I want the supermean! Whats a supermean, you ask? Ill tell you. List the n given numbers
in non-decreasing order. Now compute the average of each pair of adjacent numbers. This will give you
n 1 numbers listed in non-decreasing order. Repeat this process on the new list of numbers until you
are left with just one number - the supermean. I tried writing a program to do this, but its too slow.
:-( Can you help me?
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a line
containing n (0 < n  50000). The next line will contain the n input numbers, each one between 1000
and 1000, in non-decreasing order.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the supermean, rounded to 3
fractional digits.
