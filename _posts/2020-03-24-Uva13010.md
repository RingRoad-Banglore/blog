## Input

```
The year is 2115. The Interplanetary Commercial Planning Center (ICPC) is supported by the Au-
tonomous Communication Ministry (ACM).

A commercial operation is performed executing transactions between connected ACM offices
throughout the galaxy. The execution of a transaction between two connected ACM offices involves
a non-negative tax whose value increases, or decreases, continuously as a linear function A  t + B of
time t, where t is a real number measured in minutes during the day (0  t  24 60).

The total tax of a commercial operation performed between a source ACM office and a destination
ACM office at some time t, is calculated as the minimum possible sum of the taxes of the executed
transactions between the ACM offices visited along some path from the source ACM office to the
destination ACM office. The tax of each transaction is calculated at the same time t.

Since the tax of the transactions between connected ACM offices is continually changing during the
day, it would be better to perform the commercial operation at some specific time in the day, in order
to maximize the collected tax. At that time, ACM decides to perform the commercial operation, and
not before or after.

Your task is to write a program that receives as input the description of the ACM office network
and returns as output the maximum total tax of the commercial operation that can be achieved during
the day, that is, the maximum total tax that ACM can collect.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases; each test case is formatted as follows. The first line contains two
integers N and M , representing respectively the number of ACM offices in the network, and the number
of connections (2  N  1000 and 1  M  104). The ACM offices are identified with distinct integers
from 1 to N , being 1 the source ACM office and N the destination ACM office. Each of the next M
lines describes a connection with four integers I, J , A and B, indicating that there is a bidirectional
connection between office I and office J (1  I < J  N), such that the tax of a transaction executed
between office I and office J at time t is defined by the formula A  t + B (100  A  100 and
0  B  106). Taxes are non-negative, so A  t + B  0 for 0  t  24  60. There is at most one
connection between each pair of ACM offices, and there is at least one path between the source ACM
office and the destination ACM office.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input, output a line with a rational number representing the maximum total
tax that ACM can collect. The result must be output as a rational number with exactly five digits after
the decimal point, rounded if necessary.
