## Input

```

The famous Korean internet company has provided an internet-based photo service which allows
The famous Korean internet company users to directly take a photo of an astronomical phenomenon in
space by controlling a high-performance telescope owned by . A few days later, a meteoric shower,
known as the biggest one in this century, is expected. has announced a photo competition which
awards the user who takes a photo containing as many meteors as possible by using the photo
service. For this competition, provides the information on the trajectories of the meteors at
their web page in advance. The best way to win is to compute the moment (the time) at which the
telescope can catch the maximum number of meteors.

You have nmeteors, each moving in uniform linear motion; the meteormi moves along the trajectory
pi + t vi over time t, where t is a non-negative real value, pi is the starting point of mi and vi is the
velocity of mi. The point pi = (xi, yi) is represented by X-coordinate xi and Y -coordinate yi in the
(X,Y )-plane, and the velocity vi = (ai, bi) is a non-zero vector with two components ai and bi in the
(X,Y )-plane. For example, if pi = (1, 3) and vi = (2, 5), then the meteor mi will be at the position (0,
5.5) at time t = 0.5 because pi+ tvi = (1, 3)+0.5(2, 5) = (0, 5.5). The telescope has a rectangular
frame with the lower-left corner (0, 0) and the upper-right corner (w, h). Refer to Figure 1. A meteor
is said to be in the telescope frame if the meteor is in the interior of the frame (not on the boundary of
the frame). For example, in Figure 1, p2, p3, p4, and p5 cannot be taken by the telescope at any time
because they do not pass the interior of the frame at all. You need to compute a time at which the
number of meteors in the frame of the telescope is maximized, and then output the maximum number
of meteors.

## Output

```
Your program is to read the input from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The
number of test cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing
two integers w and h (1  w, h  100, 000), the width and height of the telescope frame, which are
separated by single space. The second line contains an integer n, the number of input points (meteors),
1  n  100, 000. Each of the next n lines contain four integers xi, yi, ai, and bi; (xi, yi) is the starting
point pi and (ai, bi) is the nonzero velocity vector vi of the i-th meteor; xi and yi are integer values
between -200,000 and 200,000, and ai and bi are integer values between -10 and 10. Note that at least
one of ai and bi is not zero. These four values are separated by single spaces. We assume that all
starting points pi are distinct.
