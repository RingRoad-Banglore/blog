title: Uva 13270  Kids Spiral Problem
---


## Input

```text
A spiral on a grid of size (2n+ 1) (2n+ 1) has been con-
structed as follows. Number 1 is in the center square at
(0, 0), number 2 is to the right of it at (1, 0), and then we
continue place the positive integers in order along the spiral
in counterclockwise fashion. Now, given 2 coordinates indi-
cating 2 corners of a rectangle, find the sum of all numbers
in the enclosing rectangle.

See the figure on the right for example.
```

## Output

```text
A number of of inputs ( 100), each starting with line
contains two integers n (1  n  109) and q (1  q  100):
the size of the grid and the number of queries.

After this, there are lines, each containing four integers
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in that order, where n  x1, y1, x2, y2  n. This is the 2 corners of the rectangle,
in cartesian 2D coordinates.

See the diagram, 1 is at the center at (0, 0).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input, output the answer modulo 1000000007.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2 3
0 -2 1 1
-1 0 1 0
1 2 1 2

```
