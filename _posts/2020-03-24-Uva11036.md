title: Uva 11036  Eventually periodic sequence
---


## Input

```text
Given is a function f : 0..N 
0..N for a non-negative N and a non-
negative integer n  N . One can
construct an infinite sequence F =
f1(n), f2(n), . . . fk(n) . . ., where fk(n) is
defined recursively as follows: f1(n) =
f(n) and fk+1(n) = f(fk(n)).

It is easy to see that each such se-
quence F is eventually periodic, that is
periodic from some point onwards, e.g
1, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6, 5, 4, 6, 5, 4, 6 . . .. Given non-
negative integer N  11000000, n  N
and f , you are to compute the period of
sequence F .
```

## Output

```text
Each line of input contains N , n and the a description of f in postfix notation, also known as Reverse
Polish Notation (RPN). The operands are either unsigned integer constants or N or the variable x.
Only binary operands are allowed: + (addition), * (multiplication) and % (modulo, i.e. remainder of
integer division). Operands and operators are separated by whitespace. The operand % occurs exactly
once in a function and it is the last (rightmost, or topmost if you wish) operator and its second operand
is always N whose value is read from input. The following function:

2 x * 7 + N %

is the RPN rendition of the more familiar infix (2*x+7)%N. All input lines are shorter than 100 char-
acters. The last line of input has N equal 0 and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, output one line with one integer number, the period of F corresponding to the
data given in the input line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 1 x N %
11 1 x x 1 + * N %
1728 1 x x 1 + * x 2 + * N %
1728 1 x x 1 + x 2 + * * N %
100003 1 x x 123 + * x 12345 + * N %
0 0 0 N %
