## Input

```text

You will be given N points on a circle. You must write a program to determine how many distinct
equilateral triangles can be constructed using the given points as vertices.

The figure below illustrates an example: (a) shows a set of points, determined by the lengths of the
circular arcs that have adjacent points as extremes; and (b) shows the two triangles which can be built
with these points.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains an integer N , the number
of points given. The second line contains N integers Xi, representing the lengths of the circular arcs
between two consecutive points in the circle: for 1  i  (N  1), Xi represents the length of the arc
between between points i and i+ 1; XN represents the length of the arc between points N and 1.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case your program must output a single line, containing a single integer, the number of
distinct equilateral triangles that can be constructed using the given points as vertices.

 3  N  105

 1  Xi  103, for 1  i  N
