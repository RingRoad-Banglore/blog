title: Uva 01152  4 Values whose Sum is 0
---


## Input

```
The SUM problem can be formulated as follows: given four lists A,B,C,D of integer values, compute
how many quadruplet (a, b, c, d)  AB C D are such that a+ b+ c+ d = 0. In the following, we
assume that all lists have the same size n.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first line of the input file contains the size of the lists n (this value can be as large as 4000).
We then have n lines containing four integer values (with absolute value as large as 228) that belong
respectively to A,B,C and D.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, your program has to write the number quadruplets whose sum is zero.

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
