## Input

```
The Department of National Defence
(DND) wishes to connect several north-
ern outposts by a wireless network.
Two different communication technolo-
gies are to be used in establishing the
network: every outpost will have a ra-
dio transceiver and some outposts will in
addition have a satellite channel.

Any two outposts with a satellite
channel can communicate via the satel-
lite, regardless of their location. Other-
wise, two outposts can communicate by
radio only if the distance between them
does not exceed D, which depends of the
power of the transceivers. Higher power
yields higher D but costs more. Due
to purchasing and maintenance consider-
ations, the transceivers at the outposts
must be identical; that is, the value of D
is the same for every pair of outposts.

Your job is to determine the minimum
D required for the transceivers. There
must be at least one communication path
(direct or indirect) between every pair of
outposts.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains N , the
number of test cases. The first line of
each test case contains 1  S  100, the number of satellite channels, and S < P  500, the number of
outposts. P lines follow, giving the (x, y) coordinates of each outpost in km (coordinates are integers
between 0 and 10,000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output should consist of a single line giving the minimum D required to connect the
network. Output should be specified to 2 decimal points.
