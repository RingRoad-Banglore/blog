title: Uva 13081  XOR Sequence Revisited
---


```
Jerry loves XOR sequence. He has an array A. The array is described below:

 A0 = 1

 Ax = Ax1  x for x > 0 ( is symbol of XOR)

First few elements of the array are [1, 0, 2, 1, 5, 0, 6, 1, 9].
Given a range [L,R], find the AND of all the elements between AL and AR (inclusive), i.e. You

need to find AL&AL+1&AL+2& . . .&AR where & is the symbol of bitwise AND operator.
```

## Input

```
First line will contain an integer number T (1  T  100000), denoting number of test cases. Each of the
next T lines contains one test case. Each test case will contain two integers L and R (0  L  R  1015).

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the answer in a single line.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
2 4
2 2

```

## Sample Output

```
0
2
```
