title: Uva 00854  Worse Code
---


```
Morse code has been used for a long time in telecommunications. Its external representation consists
of sequences of two distinct atomic symbols: the dot (a short tone) and the dash (a slightly longer
tone). A sequence of dots and dashes forms a symbol.

The exact representation associated with each symbol was constructed after a statistical analysis
of the occurrence of the various letters in English text, so as to give to the most frequent letters the
shortest representation. For instance, the letter E is represented as a single dot while the letter T is a
single dash. In regular morse code, symbols are separated by a small pause (the space atomic symbol).

The technology you are employing does not allow for spaces to separate symbols, so different ar-
rangements have to be made: youll have to make do with a Worse Code, in which there may be only
two distinct symbols (the dot and the dash).

You are asked to write a program that evaluates the resourses necessary to transmit a particular
sentence in Worse Code. In order to do that, your program has to be able to produce the optimal
Worse code, tailored for the input sentence.

The problem can be formulated as follows:

 With just an input sentence, to (internally) determine an optimal Worse Code for that sentence
and display the length (in number of dash-dot atomic symbols) of the resulting coded message.
```

## Input

```
Several input sentences, each sentence in one or more lines and terminated with a blank line or the
end-of-file character.
Notes:

 Sequences of whitespace and newlines within a sentence are to be converted into a single space
character, except if they are at the end of the sentence, in which case they are ignored.

 Lower case letters are mapped to the corresponding upper case equivalents. Any other characters,
including accented letters, are simply ignored.

```

## Output

```
The number of atomic symbols (dot or dash) in the optimal Worse Code representation for each input
sentence on a line by itself.

```

## Sample Input

```
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS
OVER THE LAZY DOG.

Don't make codes for letters not appearing
in the text!

```

## Sample Output

```
192
204
