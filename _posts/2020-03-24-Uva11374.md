title: Uva 11374  Airport Express
---


```
In a small city called Iokh, a train service, Airport-Express,
takes residents to the airport more quickly than other transports.
There are two types of trains in Airport-Express, the Economy-
Xpress and the Commercial-Xpress. They travel at different
speeds, take different routes and have different costs.

Jason is going to the airport to meet his friend. He wants to
take the Commercial-Xpress which is supposed to be faster, but
he doesnt have enough money. Luckily he has a ticket for the
Commercial-Xpress which can take him one station forward. If
he used the ticket wisely, he might end up saving a lot of time.
However, choosing the best time to use the ticket is not easy for
him.

Jason now seeks your help. The routes of the two types of
trains are given. Please write a program to find the best route
to the destination. The program should also tell when the ticket
should be used.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. Consecutive cases are separated by a blank line.

The first line of each case contains 3 integers, namely N , S and E (2  N  500, 1  S,E  N),
which represent the number of stations, the starting point and where the airport is located respectively.

There is an integer M (1  M  1000) representing the number of connections between the stations
of the Economy-Xpress. The next M lines give the information of the routes of the Economy-Xpress.
Each consists of three integers X, Y and Z (X,Y  N, 1  Z  100). This means X and Y are
connected and it takes Z minutes to travel between these two stations.

The next line is another integer K (1  K  1000) representing the number of connections between
the stations of the Commercial-Xpress. The next K lines contain the information of the Commercial-
Xpress in the same format as that of the Economy-Xpress.

All connections are bi-directional. You may assume that there is exactly one optimal route to the
airport. There might be cases where you MUST use your ticket in order to reach the airport.

```

## Output

```
For each case, you should first list the number of stations which Jason would visit in order. On the
next line, output Ticket Not Used if you decided NOT to use the ticket; otherwise, state the station
where Jason should get on the train of Commercial-Xpress. Finally, print the total time for the journey
on the last line. Consecutive sets of output must be separated by a blank line.
