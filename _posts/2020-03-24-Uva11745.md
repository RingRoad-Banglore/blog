title: Uva 11745  Slitherlink
---


```
The puzzle game Slitherlink is played on a
grid. Each cell of the grid contains either
a space or an integer from 0 to 3. The
goal is to draw in some grid lines con-
necting vertically or horizonally adjacent
points on the grid subject to the following
constraints:

1. If a grid cell is numbered k then ex-
actly k out of the 4 adjacent grid
lines are drawn.

2. The grid lines form a single loop
that does not cross itself.

Determining if a given instance of a
Slitherlink puzzle can be completed or
not is NP-complete which means nobody
knows of an efficient algorithm to solve
the problem for large grids. Your task is
simpler. Given an instance of a Slither-
link puzzle and a proposed solution, you
are to check that the solution indeed satisfies the constraints for that puzzle.

For example, the first sample input is not valid since there are 2 grid lines drawn adjacent to a cell
numbered 1. The second, third, and fourth samples are invalid since the grid lines do not form a single
loop. However, the fifth sample is valid.
```

## Input

```
The first integer denotes the number of test cases to follow. Each test case is specified by a line
containing two positive integers R and C (both at most 50) followed by a grid of 2R+1 rows of 2C +1
characters. The contents of row r and column c (counting from 1) are as follows:

1. if both r and c are odd then the character is a + indicating a grid point

2. if both r and c are even then the character is either a space or one of 0, 1, 2, or 3 indicating the
contents of the corresponding grid space

3. if r is odd and c is even then the character is either a space or - indicating a drawn horizontal
grid line

4. if r is even and c is odd then the character is either a space or | indicating a drawn vertical grid
line

You can assume all inputs are well-formed descriptions of a Slitherlink puzzle and a proposed
solution. A blank line also precedes each test case.

## Output

```
The output for each test case is a single line containing either Valid or Invalid, depending on
whether the proposed solution is valid or not.
