title: Uva 12382  Grid of Lamps
---


## Input

```
We have a grid of lamps. Some of the lamps are on, while others are off. The luminosity of a row/column
is the number of its lighted lamps. You are given a permutation of the luminosities of the rows and a
permutation of the columns. Unfortunately, these values are not accurate but we know at least that
they are not overestimates. You should tell us the minimum possible number of lighted lamps in this
grid.

As an example, consider the following grid. The lighted lamps are shown by 1s and unlighted ones
by 0s.

1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

The actual luminosities of the rows are < 3, 5, 2, 3, 1 >. A permutation of them could be
< 1, 2, 5, 3, 3 >, and the inexact values youd be given could be < 1, 1, 4, 2, 3 >.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains an integer T  100 denoting the number of test-cases. Each test-case
begins with two integers M and N , both in the interval [1, 1000], determining the number of rows and
columns of the grid respectively. The next two lines give the luminosities, the first for rows (M values)
and the second for columns (N values).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test-case, on a single line, output the minimum conceivable number of lighted lamps.
