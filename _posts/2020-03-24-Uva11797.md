```
Well, 5 of the trouble makers are going to Di-
najpur by the well known train Drutojan Ex-
press. The 5 trouble makers  Ja, Sam, Sha,
Sid and Tan were discussing about how to cre-
ate trouble in Dinajpur. But after a while they
themselves got into trouble. Well, let me share
the story with you.

The tickets they bought were the cause of
the problem. See, 4 of those tickets all shared
the same compartment while the other ticket
was for a different compartment. As you can
guess, no one was willing to go to the compart-
ment where the single seat is.

After almost two hours of quarrel and un-
mentionable fights, they were exhausted; so they came up with a plan. The plan is: each of them will
make a list containing names of the other persons. Now, if a person goes to the single seat, first he will
stay there for M minutes. After that he will exchange his seat with the person who is on top of his
own list. At this point he will also update his list by removing this name from top of his list and add
the name at the bottom of the list.

This will go on all through their journey. So you are given their lists, the person who is on the
single seat right now and the total time N (in minutes) for which they would be traveling. For each of
them, you have to find the total time he will stay in the single seat. You can assume that its takes 2
minutes to exchange seats. And you will start time counting from the 0-th minute. That means if M is
5 and the first person who is in the single is Sid, then he will exchange after 5 minutes. Then from the
7-th minute the next person in his list (Sha) will be in that seat. Remember that a person can leave
the seat without staying M minutes if the train reaches the destination within M .
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input will contain an integer T ( 500) denoting the number of cases.

Each case starts with two integers M (2  M  30) and N (10  N  1000) and the name of
the person who is in the single seat. Then there will be 5 lines. Each of the lines represents a list. A
list contains and integer k (1  k  20) and k names separated by spaces. That means this list has k
members and the names are listed from top to bottom. These 5 lines contain lists of Ja, Sam, Sha, Sid
and Tan respectively. In a list, a name can occur more than once. You can assume no one will put his
own name in his list.

```

## Output

```
For each case print the the case number in a single line. Then print 5 lines for each person (in the order
shown below) and total time he will be on the single seat. Check samples for details. Report the names
as in input.
