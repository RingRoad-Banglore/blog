title: Uva 10982  Troublemakers

## Input

```text
[after seeing that the room is on fire; Ted has a needle

in his hand while holding the leg of a dead woman; Sara
has a bottle of champagne in her hand, and Juancho is smoking]

Man: Did they misbehave?
Robert Rodrigues, The Misbehavers.

Every school class has its troublemakers  those kids who can make the teachers life miserable.
On his own, a troublemaker is manageable, but when you put certain pairs of troublemakers together in
the same room, teaching a class becomes very hard. There are n kids in Mrs. Shaidas math class, and
there are m pairs of troublemakers among them. The situation has gotten so bad that Mrs. Shaida has
decided to split the class into two classes. Help her do it in such a way that the number of troublemaker
pairs is reduced by at least a half.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a line
containing n (0  n  100) and m (0 < m < 5000). The next m lines will contain a pair of integers u
and v meaning that when kids u and v are in the same room, they make a troublemaker pair. Kids are
numbered from 1 to n.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by L  the number of kids who
will be moved to a different class (in a different room). The next line should list those kids. The total
number of troublemaker pairs in the two rooms must be at most m/2. If that is impossible, print
Impossible. instead of L and an empty line afterwards.
