## Input

```

A competition was just over. It had 3 problems and n players. Each player had an ID number from 1
to n. The final rank was decided by the total score of the 3 problems. The higher the total score was,
the higher a player ranked (the smaller the rank number). If two players got the same total score, the
one with the smaller ID number got a higher rank. Weve known for each problem, how much score
each player might get if he dint solve totally wrong (if solved totally wrong, the player got zero in the
problem). However, we dont know whether a player did get score in a problem. For a predicted final
rank, you need to judge if the rank is possible.
```

## Output

```
Input contains several cases. For each case, the first line is an integer n, (n  16384) to indicate
the number of players, followed by n lines, the i-th of which contains three real numbers a, b, c
(0  a, b, c < 1000. a, b and c have 2 decimal places at most.) to respectively indicate the score of each
problem Player i might get if he didnt solve totally wrong. Another line containing n integers follows
to indicate the player ID number in the order from rank 1-st to rank n-th.

The last case is followed by a line containing only a zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, if the rank is possible, output the highest possible total score for the player with the
lowest rank (calculate to 2 decimal places), otherwise output No solution (quotes for clarity).

Sample Explanation:

Case 1:

Rank Player ID Number Problem 1s Score Problem 2s Score Problem 3s Score

1 1 100 200 300

2 2 100 200 300

3 3 100 200 300

Case 2:

Rank Player ID Number Problem 1s Score Problem 2s Score Problem 3s Score
