```
The alfalfas team is visiting the Great Wall of China. They want to cross it from beginning to the end,
but some parts of the Great Wall was rebuilt for the tourists and it is necessary to pay a toll. Then,
they bought a map that represented the Great Wall as a grid of 5 rows and n columns. Each site was
marked with a digit that represents the cost to the toll. The alfalfas want that you write a program to
get the way to cross the Great Wall from column 0 to n  1 with the minimum cost. They began in
the first column, each per represented by @. The cost of all sites in the first column are 0. They can
move only horizontally and vertically. They want to visit all unique parts of the Great wall, so they
never pass through the sites that another alfalfa has visited.
