title: Uva 12554  A Special Happy Birthday Song!!!
---


## Input

```text
There are n people (excluding myself) in my 30th birthday party. They sing the traditional happy
birthday song:

Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to Rujia! Happy birthday to you!!!

Since I love music, I want to hear something more interesting, not that everyone sings together. Ah
yes, I want one person to sing one word!

For example, there are three people: Mom, Dad, Girlfriend, Id like them to sing like this:

Mom: Happy
Dad: birthday
Girlfriend: to
Mom: you
Dad: Happy
Girlfriend: birthday
Mom: to
Dad: you
Girlfriend: Happy
Mom: birthday
Dad: to
Girlfriend: Rujia
Mom: Happy
Dad: birthday
Girlfriend: to
Mom: you

Very nice, right? What if there are more than 16 people? Thats easy: repeat the song until
everyone has sung at least once :)

Please, dont stop in the middle of the song.
