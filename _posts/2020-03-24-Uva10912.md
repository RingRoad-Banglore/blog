title: Uva 10912  Simple Minded Hashing
---


```
All of you know a bit or two about hashing. It involves mapping an element into a numerical value
using some mathematical function. In this problem we will consider a very simple minded hashing. It
involves assigning numerical value to the alphabets and summing these values of the characters.

For example, the string acm is mapped to 1 + 3 + 13 = 17. Unfortunately, this method does not
give one-to-one mapping. The string adl also maps to 17 (1 + 4 + 12). This is called collision.

In this problem you will have to find the number of strings of length L, which maps to an integer S,
using the above hash function. You have to consider strings that have only lowercase letters in strictly
ascending order.

Suppose L = 3 and S = 10, there are 4 such strings.

1. abg

2. acf

3. ade

4. bce

agb also produces 10 but the letters are not strictly in ascending order.
bh also produces 10 but it has 2 letters.
```

## Input

```
There will be several cases. Each case consists of 2 integers L and S (0 < L,S < 10000). Input is
terminated with 2 zeros.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output Case#: where # is replaced by case number. Then output the result. Follow
the sample for exact format. The result will fit in 32 signed integers.

```

## Sample Input

```
3 10
2 3
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 4
Case 2: 1
```
