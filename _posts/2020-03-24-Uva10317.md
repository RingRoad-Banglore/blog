title: Uva 10317  Equating Equations
---


```
Read (incorrect) equations with up to 16 terms and + and - operators and reorder the terms (but
not the operators) so that the equations hold. For example

1 + 2 = 4 - 5 + 6

is not a correct equation but the terms can be rearranged thus so it is:

6 + 2 = 4 - 1 + 5
```

## Input

```
Standard input consists of several pseudo-equations, one per line. Each pseudo-equation has up to 16
integer terms and each term is less than 100. Adjacent terms are separated by one operator, and spaces
may appear surrounding the terms. There is exactly one = operator in the equation.

```

## Output

```
Your output will consist of one line per input line, with the same operators and the same terms. The
order of the operators must be preserved, but the terms must be reordered so the equation holds. Any
ordering such that the equation holds is correct. If there is more than one ordering any one of the
orderings will do.

If no ordering exists, a line containing

no solution

should be printed. One space should appear on either side of each operator and there should be no
other spaces.

```

## Sample Input

```
1 + 2 = 4 - 5 + 6
1 + 5 = 6 + 7

```

## Sample Output

```
6 + 2 = 4 - 1 + 5
no solution
```
