```
Prof. Peter decided to surprise his class by organizing a new lot-
tery with a very peculiar system.

He starts by announcing a small positive number M . After-
wards, each student is going to secretly write an integer from the
set {1, ...,M} on a slip of paper that is then folded. After every-
one has selected a number, they reveal all choices and whoever
wrote down the lowest unique number is the winner! For instance,
if there are only three students in the class, two of them select
number 2 and the other selects number 5, then the student who
chose number 5 is the winner.

The lottery was a success, but Prof. Peter is now wondering
what strategy his students should have used. If everyone follows the same optimal randomized strategy,
with which probability should each number be chosen so that they maximize their chances of winning?
A strategy is optimal if, when everyone is following it, then no individual student can improve his
winning probability by selecting a different strategy. Can you help Prof. Peter?

Given N , the number of students in the class, and M , the largest number they can write down,
determine the optimal randomized strategy (followed by all students). That is, determine the probability
of selecting each number between 1 and M .
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

There is one line with two integers: N , which is the number of students in the class, and M , which
is the largest integer each student can choose.

Constraints
3  N  7 Number of students in the class
1  M  N + 1 Maximum number that can be selected

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output consists of M lines. Line k should have the probability of selecting
number k.

The result will be considered correct as long as the absolute error does not exceed 103.
