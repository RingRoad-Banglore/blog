title: Uva 10848  Make Palindrome Checker
---


```
As you all know, Miguel Revilla has been very busy revising the website for the programming contest.
But alas, as things go, he lost some files in the upgrade. And even worse: as he backups his files as
frequently as most of us, he cannot restore them. He clearly needs some help.

One of the files lost is the file with the test vectors for Make Palindrome, problem 10453
(http://acm.uva.es/p/v104/10453.html). Miguel needs a program to test the contributions to this
problem. In order to do this, he first makes a new file from the file with the test inputs and the file with
the outputs of a program: every line consists of the input to the program and its output, separated by
a space. Systematic as he is, he makes a list of properties every line in this new file should have:

1. It consists of a first string of lower case characters (length le1000), a single space, an integer ( 0,
 1000), a single space, and a second string of lower case letters (length  2000), we will call this
property P1.

2. P1 & the second string is a palindrome.

3. P1 & all letters of the first string appear in the second string.

4. P1 & the frequency of every letter in the second string is at least the frequency of this letter in
the first string.

5. P1 & the first string can be made out of the second string by removing 0 or more letters (and
leaving the order of the letters intact).

6. P1 & the length of the second string is equal to the length of the first string plus the value of the
integer.

7. P1 & the value of the integer is smaller than the length of the first string.

Obviously, the list is not complete, but given the time pressure Miguel is under and the short nights
he has had during the upgrade, we can easily forgive him.
```

## Input

```
Every input consists of a concatenation of an input submitted to and an output computed by a program
made to the specification of Make Palindrome, separated by a space. Every line contains less than
5000 ASCII characters. Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of the value T or F (for True and False; without the quotes) for every property
in the list above, and a statement The solution is accepted if all properties are true, and The
solution is not accepted otherwise (again, both without the quotes). There is a single space
between the statement and the Ts and Fs; there is none between the Ts and Fs.
