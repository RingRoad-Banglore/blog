## Input

```

Finally, desperate Bilbo asked Gollum the following programming puzzle. Help the poor creature with
his dinner!

A = {A[1], A[2], . . . , A[N ]} is a sequence of lowercase letters.
B = {B[1], B[2], . . . , B[K]} is another such sequence. B is called a subsequence of A if there exists

a set of integers S = {S[1], S[2], . . . , S[K]} such that the following two conditions are true:

(i) 1  S[1] < S[2] < . . . < S[K]  N

(ii) A[S[i]] = B[i] for all 1  i  K

Here, S is called an occurrence of B in A. S is called the earliest occurrence of B in A, if there is
no other occurrence Y such that, Y [j] < S[j] for some 1  j  K.

The earliest occurrence S of B in A is called a weak occurrence if, S[i+1]S[i]  M for all 1  i < K.
Here, M is called the weakness limit.

For example, if M = 2 then {b, c, d} has a weak occurrence in {a, b, y, c, d, c, d}, but {a,
c, d} doesnt.

You are given a forbidden sequence F of lowercase letters and a weakness limit M . A sequence X
of length N is called strong if one of the following conditions is true:

(i) the earliest occurrence of F in X is not a weak occurrence or

(ii) F doesnt occur in X at all.

Write a program to calculate the number of strong sequences of lowercase letters of length N . Print
the answer modulo 1000000007.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains T , the number of test cases. T  5000. Each test case consists
of two lines. The first line contains a non-empty string of lowercase letters that denotes the forbidden
sequence F which contains no more than 100 characters. The next line contains two positive integers
M (1  M  10) and N (1  N  109), where M denotes the weakness limit and N denotes the
desired length of the strong sequences.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input, print the output in the format, Case X: Y  where X is the serial of the input
and Y is the desired output (see the sample output for clarification).
