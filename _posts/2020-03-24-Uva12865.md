```
Controlling the volume level is important for com-
puters, smart phones or any hardware that plays
music or songs or acts as a sound mixing device.
Most such devices have one master volume con-
troller and one or more secondary volume con-
troller. Having more than one controller is useful
for two reasons: (i) We can keep volume levels dif-
ferent for different programs (Software)/ devices
(Hardware) (ii) Higher precision volume control.

The first reason is common and well known to
all of us but in this problem we will concentrate on
the second reason. In the figure on the left, a vol-
ume control interface is shown. Using the master
volume controller one can set the general volume
level for all sound/mixing devices and using the
other volume controllers, one can set volume level for individual sound devices/software. For example
after midnight one would like to keep the headphone sound level high but the Speaker sound level low
for obvious reasons. But for high quality sound devices this two level controlling can ensure higher
precision volume controlling. For example if the master volume controller can set 100 different dis-
crete volume levels (Equidistant levels of course) it cannot actually set more than 100 levels, but if the
Speaker volume controller can also set 100 different discrete volume levels then in combination they
can set a lot more than 100 volume levels. If both the master and the speaker volume controller is at
50% level, in actually the speaker is at (0.500.50100 = 25%) volume level (Considering 100% as the
highest possible volume level), if the master and the speaker volume controller is at 30% and 42% level
respectively then the speaker is actually at level 12.6%. Given the number of different volume levels
both the Master and the secondary volume controller can set you have to report how many different
volume levels they can create combined.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input file contains a positive integer T (T  10, 000) which indicates the total number
of test cases. Each of the next line contains a positive integer N (N  30, 000) which denotes how many
different volume levels (Excluding the 0% level) both the Master and secondary volume controller can
set.

```

## Output

```
For each test case produce one line of output. This line contains an integer D which denotes how many
different volume levels can be set using the Master and secondary volume controller.
Note:

Illustration of the 2nd sample input. The master volume controller can set volumes to 0%, 25%,
50%, 75% and 100% and the secondary volume controller can reduce this again to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%
and 100%. So when these two are combined they can set volume levels to 0%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 0%,
6.25%, 12.5%, 18.75%, 25%, 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%, 0%, 18.75%, 37.5%, 56.25%, 75%, 0%, 25%,
50%, 75%, 100%. So unique volume levels these two can set are 0%, 6.25%, 12.5%, 18.75%, 25%, 37.5%,
50%, 56.25%, 75% and 100%, so total 10 different volume levels.
