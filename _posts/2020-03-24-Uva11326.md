title: Uva 11326  Laser Pointer
---


## Input

```text
Jake and his friends have been walking around a
house of mirrors at a carnival for quite some time
now. While Jakes friends are still interested in see-
ing a few rooms, Jake is quite bored. He decides to
wait by the exit while the rest of them search the re-
mainder of the house. Jake also has a laser pointer
which he plays with to help pass the time.

The exit is located at the end of a hallway of
length L and width W where 0 < L,W  10, 000.
The walls along the length of the hallway are lined
with mirrors. Jake is at the start of the hallway and
is leaning against the right wall. He shines his laser
pointer toward the exit making an angle (in degrees)
of 0   < 90 with the right wall.

The laser beam travels some distance A, perhaps reflecting off one or more walls, until it illuminates
a spot at the end of the hall on the exit door. In his boredom, Jake wonders how much further this
beam travelled than if he had shone the laser pointer directly at the spot on the door. That is, if the
Euclidean distance from the laser pointer to the illuminated point on the wall is B, Jake is trying to
determine the ratio A/B.
