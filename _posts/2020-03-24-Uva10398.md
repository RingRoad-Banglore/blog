## Input

```
The plane can be tiled by a geometric progression of equilateral triangles, with a polynomial charac-
teristic equation, as shown in the figure below. You can assume the following things:

a) The width of the black borders of the triangles are negligible

b) The geometric progression of the triangles is forming pentagons of different sizes.

You can see in the picture above that the triangles are numbered 1, 2, 3, , etc. In this problem
your job is two fold:

a) Find out the length of a side of the I-th triangle if the length is less than 1000000000 and print
its nearest smaller round number (L).

b) If the length of a side of the I-th triangle is greater than or equal to 1000000000 then print how
many digits L has in decimal number system. The meaning of L is given above.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains N (N  7300) lines of input. Each line contains a floating point number S
(0  S  10000) which is the length of a side of the first triangle, and an integer I (1  I < 100000000).
The meaning of I is described before. Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains a single integer L or D. Here L
indicates the length of a side of I-th triangle rounded down to the nearest integer. If L is not less than
1000000000 then you should output D instead of L, where D is the number of digits in L.
