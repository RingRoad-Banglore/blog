## Input

```
In this problem you are expected to count two-terminal series-parallel networks. These are electric
networks considered topologically or geometrically, that is, without the electrical properties of the
elements connected. One of the two terminals can be considered as the source and the other as the
sink.

A two-terminal network will be considered series-parallel if it can be obtained iteratively in the
following way:

 A single edge is two-terminal series-parallel.

 If G1 and G2 are two-terminal series-parallel, so is the network obtained by identifying the sources
and sinks, respectively (parallel composition).

 If G1 and G2 are two-terminal series-parallel, so is the network obtained by identifying the sink
of G1 with the source of G2 (series composition).

Note here that in a series-parallel network two nodes can be connected by multiple edges. Moreover,
networks are regarded as equivalent, not only topologically, but also when interchange of elements in
series brings them into congruence; otherwise stated, series interchange is an equivalence operation. For
example, the following three networks are equivalent:

Similarly, parallel interchange is also an equivalence operation. For example, the following three
networks are also equivalent:

Now, given a number N , you are expected to count the number of two-terminal series parallel
networks containing exactly N edges. For example, for N = 4, there are exactly 10 series-parallel
networks as shown below:
```

## Output

```
Each line of the input file contains an integer N (1  N  30) specifying the number of edges in the
network.

A line containing a zero for N terminates the input and this input need not be considered.
