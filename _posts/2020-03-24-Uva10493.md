---


## Input

```
A cat wears a hat if and only if it has N cats in its hat. There
is exactly one cat that is not inside any other cats hat. If there
are M cats without hats, how many cats are there?
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several test cases. For each case, there would be
two integers, N and M , where 1  N < 100000 and 1  M <
100000. The input ends with a case where N = 0. You must not
process this test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print N and M . Then if the total number of
cats can be expressible uniquely in an integer, print the number.
If the case is impossible print the word Impossible without
quotes. If there are multiple answers, print the word Multiple
without the quotes.

```

## Sample Output

```
2 5
3 4
3 3
0 0

```
