title: Uva 12586  Overlapping Characters
---


## Input

```

All the uppercase English letters and decimal digits (total 36 characters) can be written in (16*43)
grids (16 rows and 43 columns) using dots (.) and asterisks (*). Some such characters are shown
below. As you can see that the empty pixels are marked with .s and black pixels are marked with *s.

When these characters are placed one over another (without scaling, translation or rotation) it is
very difficult to judge from above how many characters are there in the pile. Sometimes it is also very
difficult to say which characters are in the pile but sometimes it is very easy as you can tell whether
a character is present in the pile just by checking a single pixel (if the pixel is black the character is
present, otherwise absent). Suppose out of the 36 characters you have specific grid representation of
specific M characters with you. From those M character grids your friend can choose any number of
grids and place them in any order to form a pile and then ask you to guess which characters are present
there. But you are clever and you know that there are certain characters whose presence in the pile
can be detected just by checking a single pixel (regardless of whatever your friend does). Given the
characters in hand your job is to identify the characters whose presence can be detected by checking
only a single pixel.
```

## Output

```
There is only a single set of input.

First line of the input file contains two integers N (1  N  36) and Q (1  Q  1000). Here
N is the total number of character grids to consider for all the queries of this problem and Q denotes
the total number of queries. The next line contains a string consisting exactly N distinct uppercase
alpha-numerals. This string denotes the order in which the description alpha-numeral grids will appear
in the input. The next 17N lines describe the grid for N characters. Each character-grid is described

in exactly 16 lines but there is a line containing only empty pixels following the description of each
character.

Each of the next Q lines a string of M (1  M  18) characters which describes the set of characters
from which your friend can choose any number of character grids and place on a pile in any order. All
the characters in this query string will be distinct.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each query produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by a string
containing only N or Y (one for each character in the input query string). The printed character
should be Y if the presence of the corresponding input character grid can be identified by checking
whether a single pixel is black. N should be printed otherwise. (Note that sometimes if a single pixel
is empty, the presence of a character can certainly be detected. But we are not considering that issue
in this problem)
