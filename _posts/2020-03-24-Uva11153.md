Museums have been playing a very important role in the development of art and culture in
various places around the world. Museums acquire, conserve, research, communicate and
exhibit, for purposes of study, education and enjoyment, material evidence of people and
their environment...

- Museums Guide Book, LCSD, 2003

You are on holiday, and being a culture lover, you de-
cide to visit some museums this afternoon. You have the
Museums Guide Book on hand, in which details of all muse-
ums are included. To each museum you have also assigned a
fun index, ranging from 1 to 9, describing how interesting
it is.

Everything seems fine except that you have a pretty low
budget, as you need to save up money to buy manga books.
Whats worse, the time you can use is also limited, thus you
may not be able to visit all museums. As a result, you will
need to plan your trip carefully such that the fun you can
get is maximized, i.e. the total fun index of all places you
visit is the greatest.

Here are some guidelines for your planning. Firstly,
since you will travel in your car, you will assume the trans-
port cost to be $0. Secondly, you will need to spend at
least 15 minutes at the museum for each visit  youve
really got to look at the exhibits! Thirdly, you should not
visit any museum more than once, although you may travel past it many times. Last but not least,
your trip should start and end both at your home.

You see that planning the trip is a real torture to your mind, so you need to write a program
that helps you with it. Given the details of all museums and roads as well as the restrictions on money
and time, your program should find the maximum fun you can get.

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases. The first line of the input file gives the number of cases.

The first line of each case gives four positive integers d, t, n and m. d is the amount of money
you can spend (in dollars), which will not exceed 100. t is the time limit for your trip (in minutes),
which can be up to 600. n gives the number of museums in your list, which will always be less than 13.
Finally, m is the number of roads, which has a upper limit of n (n+ 1)/2.

Next comes n lines, each with two integers specifying the admission fee (in dollars, not greater than
50) and fun index of a museum.

Each of the following m lines of the input has three integers i, j and k, which means that a
bidirectional road connects nodes i and j, and it takes k ( 200) minutes for your car to go through it.
In this problem we define node 0 as the position of your home, and node i as the i-th museum in your
above list. Please note that some (but not all) museums might NOT be reachable from your home at
all, so be careful. Moreover, no roads will connect a node to itself, but there might be more than one
road between two nodes.
