title: Uva 12719  Fill the Cuboid
---


## Input

```

Can you fill an (a  b  c) cuboid with exactly n cubes? The cubes may touch, but cannot overlap and
each cell inside the (a  b  c) cuboid should be covered by exactly one cube. You may use cubes of
different dimensions and for each positive integer p, you can use as many (p  p  p) cubes as you like.
For example, a (2  2  3) cuboid can be filled with five cubes: four (1  1  1) cubes and one (2  2  2)
cube. It can also be filled with twelve (1  1  1) cubes.

To make this problem slightly more difficult, m of the cells in the cuboid are already filled and cannot
be filled by another cube. Your job is to find out the possible values of n such that the remaining cells
inside the cuboid, can be filled by exactly n cubes.
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 300 test cases. Each test case begins with four integers a, b, c, m (2  a, b, c  20,
a  b  c  125, 0  m < a  b  c).

Each of the next m lines contains three integers x, y, z (1  x  a, 1  y  b, 1  z  c), that
means the cell (x, y, z) is already filled.

No cell will be mentioned twice. There will be at least one non-filled cell.
The input is terminated by a line containing four zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the list of possible answers in increasing order. There is
a single space before each number in the output. Look at the output for sample input for details.
