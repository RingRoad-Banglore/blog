title: Uva 12385  Interesting Sequences
---


```
For a sequence of integer numbers < x1, x2, . . . , xn >, a contiguous subsequence < xi, xi+1, . . . , xj >
where i < j  n, is called interesting if its first and last elements are equal (i.e., xi = xj). Two
interesting subsequences S1 =< xi, xi+1, . . . , xj > and S2 =< xa, xa+1, . . . , xb > are called conflict-
free if either a  j or i  b.

For a given sequence of known size, find the maximum number of interesting subsequences which
are pairwise conflict-free.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains an integer T  100 denoting the number of test-cases. Each test-case
begins with an integer 1  N  100, 000, on a separate line, denoting the size of the sequence. The
following line contains N positive integers each between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive).

```

## Output

```
For each test-case, output on a single line the maximum number of pairwise conflict-free interesting
subsequences.
