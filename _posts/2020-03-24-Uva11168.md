title: Uva 11168  Airport

## Input

```
It is no coincidence that in no known language

does the phrase As pretty as an Airport appear.

Douglas Adams

There is a small town with n houses. The town needs an airport. An airport is basically a very
long, very straight road. Think of it as an infinite line. We need to build the airport such that the
average distance from each house to the airport is as small as possible. However, no one wants to walk
across the runway, so all of the houses must be on the same side of the airport. (Some houses may be
a distance of zero away from the runway, but thats ok; well give them some free ear plugs.)

Where should we build the airport, and what will be the average distance?
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N ( 65). N test cases follow. Each one is a
line containing n (0 < n  10000), followed by n lines giving the xy-coordinates of the houses. All
coordinates are integers with absolute value of at most 80,000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the average distance from the
airport to the houses, with 3 digits after the decimal point. No answer will be within 105 of a round-off
error case.
