```
Calvin likes to lie in a field and look at the night sky. Since he doesnt know any real star constellations,
he makes them up: if two stars are close to each other, they must belong to the same constellation.
He wants to name them all, but fears to run out of names. Can you help him and count how many
constellations there are in the sky?

Two stars belong to the same constellation if distance between their projections on a two-dimensional
sky plane isnt more than D units.
```

## Input

```
There is a number of tests T (T  50) on the first line. Each test case contains the number of stars N
(0  N  1000) a real distance D (0.00  D  1000.00). Next N lines have a pair of real coordinates
X Y (1000.00  X,Y  1000.00) for each star. Real numbers in the input will have at most 2 digits
after a decimal point.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output a single line Case T: N . Where T is the test case number (starting from
1) and N is the number of constellations.
