title: Uva 10674  Tangents
---


## Input

```text
You can see in the pictures below that two different circles can have at most four common tangents.
Given the center and radius of two circles your job is to find the length of their common tangents and
also the points where they touch the two circles.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several lines of inputs.

Each line contains six integers x1 (100  x1  100), y1 (100  y1  100), r1 (0 < r1  200),
x2 (100  x2  100), y2 (100  y2  100), r2 (0 < r2  200). Here (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the
coordinates of the center of the first circle and second circle respectively, r1 is the radius of the first
circle and r2 is the radius of the second circle.

Input is terminated by a line containing six zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input you should produce one of more lines of output. The description of this output
is given below.

First line of the output for each line of input contains an integer n, which denotes the number
of different tangents between the two circles. If there is infinite number of tangents between the two
circles then the value of n should be -1. If n is positive then next n lines contains the description
of each tangent. The description of the tangent contains five floating-point numbers Sx, Sy, Tx, Ty,
L in a single line. Here (Sx, Sy) is the point at which the tangent touches the first circle and (Tx, Ty)
is the point where the tangent touches the second circle and L is the length of the tangent. All the
floating-point numbers have five digits after the decimal point. Errors less than 2105 will be ignored.
The tangents should be printed in ascending order of Sx and in case of a tie they should be printed in
ascending order of Sy.

```
