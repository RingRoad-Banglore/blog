title: Uva 12073  Altitude Triangle
---


## Input

```text
If DEF is an acute triangle and DA, EB and FC are its three heights on EF, DF and DE respectively,
then the triangle ABC is called the altitude triangle of triangle DEF. It is well known that DA, EB
and FC are concurrent and let us assume that their common point of intersection is O. So point O is
called the orthocenter of triangle DEF. It can be proved that O is the in center of triangle ABC. In
this problem you will be given the altitude triangle ABC and your job is to find out the corresponding
acute triangle DEF.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 2000 lines of input. Each line contains six integers x1, y1, x2, y2 and
x3, y3. These six integers denote an altitude triangle with vertex A (x1, y1), B (x2, y2) and C (x3, y3)
respectively. Input is terminated by a case where all six integers are zero. The points A, B and C will
not be collinear.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce four lines of outputs. The description of these four lines is given below:

The first line contains the serial of output. Each of the next three lines contains two floating-point
numbers, which are actually the coordinate of D, E and F respectively. Note that for a given altitude
triangle ABC, there can be four possible triangles DEF. But you are requested only to find the one
that is acute. Also note that judge data will be such that precision errors should not occur if you use
double precision floating-point numbers. Absolute values of none of the output numbers will be greater
than 100000 and all the numbers should have three digits after the decimal point.
