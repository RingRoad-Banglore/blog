title: Uva 10344  23 Out of 5
---


```
Your task is to write a program that can decide whether you can find an arithmetic expression consisting
of five given numbers ai (1  i  5) that will yield the value 23.

For this problem we will only consider arithmetic expressions of the following from:

(((a(1) o1 a(2)) o2 a(3)) o3 a(4)) o4 a(5)

where  : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a bijective function and oi  {+,, }(1  i  4)
```

## Input

```
The Input consists of 5-Tupels of positive Integers, each between 1 and 50.

Input is terminated by a line containing five zeros. This line should not be processed. Input file
will have no more than 25 lines.

```

## Output

```
For each 5-Tupel print Possible (without quotes) if their exists an arithmetic expression (as described
above) that yields 23. Otherwise print Impossible.

```

## Sample Input

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 5 7 11
0 0 0 0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
Impossible
Possible
Possible
```
