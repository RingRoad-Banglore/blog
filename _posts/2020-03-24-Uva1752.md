title: Uva 01752  Money for Nothing
---


## Input

```text
In this problem you will be solving one of the most profound challenges of humans across the world
since the beginning of time  how to make lots of money.

You are a middleman in the widget market. Your job is to buy widgets from widget producer
companies and sell them to widget consumer companies. Each widget consumer company has an open
request for one widget per day, until some end date, and a price at which it is willing to buy the widgets.
On the other hand, each widget producer company has a start date at which it can start delivering
widgets and a price at which it will deliver each widget.

Due to fair competition laws, you can sign a contract with only one producer company and only one
consumer company. You will buy widgets from the producer company, one per day, starting on the day
it can start delivering, and ending on the date specified by the consumer company. On each of those
days you earn the difference between the producers selling price and the consumers buying price.

Your goal is to choose the consumer company and the producer company that will maximize your
profits.
