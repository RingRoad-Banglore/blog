title: Uva 12431  Happy 109 Day
---


## Input

```
2011 is a very special year. There appeared some amazing dates in this year which would appear every
100 years. 1-1-11, 1-11-11, 11-1-11, 11-11-11 are some of many amazing dates. Oh, by the way, I hope
you already found out why the problem name says 10/9. If you convert it to decimal then you will find
series of 1 appears. However same logic applies for 1/9 or 100/9 also. This problem is related with
same digit appearance.

In short the problem asks you to find X%M where X is an n-digit number consisting only of digit
d. But we are a bit visionary. We want to generalize this problem a bit. Who knows one day we will
not use 10 base number system anymore, may be 2 base, or 16 base or any other number! So you have
to calculate the value considering the number in base b (d < b).

For example, for b = 10, n = 3, d = 2 our X = 222. So if our M is say 10, then X%M = 2 which is
the answer.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains a single positive integer T (1  T  1, 000) denoting the number of test
cases. Then in each of the following T lines, there will be 4 integers n, b, d and M (2  b le100 and
1  n,M  1012). All these numbers are given in base 10.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each of the cases output the case number followed by the desired answer. For clarity please follow
the sample input output. Remember that this output should always be in base 10, irrespective of the
input.
