title: Uva 01479  Graph and Queries
---


```

You are given an undirected graph with N vertexes and M edges. Every vertex in this graph has an
integer value assigned to it at the beginning. Youre also given a sequence of operations and you need
to process them as requested. Heres a list of the possible operations that you might encounter:

1. Deletes an edge from the graph.

The format is [D X], where X is an integer from 1 to M , indicating the ID of the edge that you
should delete. It is guaranteed that no edge will be deleted more than once.

2. Queries the weight of the vertex with K-th maximum value among all vertexes cur-
rently connected with vertex X (including X itself).

The format is [Q X K], where X is an integer from 1 to N , indicating the id of the vertex, and
you may assume that K will always fit into a 32-bit signed integer. In case K is illegal, the value
for that query will be considered as undefined, and you should return 0 as the answer to that
query.

3. Changes the weight of a vertex.

The format is [C X V ], where X is an integer from 1 to N , and V is an integer within the range
[106, 106].

The operations end with one single character, E, which indicates that the current case has ended.
For simplicity, you only need to output one real number  the average answer of all queries.
```

## Input

```
There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each case starts with two integers N and M (1  N 
2  104, 0  M  6  104), the number of vertexes in the graph. The next N lines describes the initial
weight of each vertex (106  weight[i]  106). The next part of each test case describes the edges
in the graph at the beginning. Vertexes are numbered from 1 to N . The last part of each test case
describes the operations to be performed on the graph. It is guaranteed that the number of query
operations [Q X K] in each case will be in the range [1, 2  105], and there will be no more than 2  105
operations that change the values of the vertexes [C X V ].

There will be a blank line between two successive cases. A case with N = 0, M = 0 indicates the
end of the input file and this case should not be processed by your program.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one real number  the average answer of all queries, in the format as
indicated in the sample output. Please note that the result is rounded to six decimal places.

Explanation for samples:
For the first sample:
D 3  deletes the 3rd edge in the graph (the remaining edges are (1, 2) and (2, 3))
Q 1 2  finds the vertex with the second largest value among all vertexes connected with 1. The

answer is 20.
Q 2 1  finds the vertex with the largest value among all vertexes connected with 2. The answer is

30.

D 2  deletes the 2nd edge in the graph (the only edge left after this operation is (1, 2))
Q 3 2  finds the vertex with the second largest value among all vertexes connected with 3. The

answer is 0 (Undefined).
C 1 50  changes the value of vertex 1 to 50.
Q 1 1  finds the vertex with the largest value among all vertex connected with 1. The answer is 50.
E  This is the end of the current test case. Four queries have been evaluated, and the answer to

this case is (20 + 30 + 0 + 50) / 4 = 25.000.

For the second sample, caution about the vertex with same weight:
Q 1 1  the answer is 20
Q 1 2  the answer is 20
Q 1 3  the answer is 10
