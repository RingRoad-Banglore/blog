title: Uva 12907  Toby the adventurer
---


```
Toby is a great adventurer. Today he is trying to explore Bitland (a new country that will be
remembered after Tobys exploration).

Bitland is divided into N small cities and M unidirectional roads between cities.
Toby begins the adventure at the city R, and after that he goes to any city R, if this new city

(R) is not known by Toby, a road between R and R is needed and he must pay a cost (in terms of
adventure power) associated to the road. Otherwise, if Toby wants to go to a known city he does not
need pay anything, even if there is no road from the current city to the target city (like teleportation)...
is not Toby so cool?

Toby keeps traveling between cities until he reaches every city in Bitland. After this moment Toby
goes to home, happy and eager for new adventures.

Wait! Where is the problem?
Did you remember that Toby has to pay for each road that is used to disclose a new city? Help

Toby to minimize this cost (the sum of all power paid), because he needs as much energy as possible
for his new adventures.

## Input

```
The input starts with an integer 1 < T  100 indicating the number of test cases.

Each test case begins with three integers 3 < N  10000, 3 < M  N , 0  R < N denoting the
number of cities, number of roads and initial city, respectively. Followed by M lines which contain three
integers, 0  u, v < N , 1  w  10000. These numbers denote a road from the city u to the city v with
cost w.

Note that there could be several roads between the same pair of cities

```

## Output

```
Print one line with the total cost for the adventure, followed by N  1 lines with the chosen roads in
the same format that was given in the input:

u v w  three space separated integers denoting a road from u to v with cost w.

If there are several answers, print any of them.
If there is no way to visit all the N cities, print impossible without quotes.
