## Input

```
Given n objects youd have to tell how many different groups can be chosen if r objects are taken at a
time.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of 100 test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n (0 < n  50), m (0  m  n).
The next line will contain the labels (numbers in the range 1 to n) of the n objects you are to choose
from. Two objects with the same label are considered equivalent. Then in the last line for that test
case, youd have m values for r. There will be a single space separating two consecutive numbers in a
line. Input is terminated by a test case where n = 0, you must not process this test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the test case number. And for each query number r, print the number of
different groups that can be formed if r objects are taken from the given n objects. You can assume
that for all input cases, the output will always fit in a 64-bit unsigned integer and (0  r  n).

```

## Sample Output

```
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
2 1
4 1
1 2 3 4
2
0 0

```
