title: Uva 10475  Help the Leaders

## Input

```
Have you ever listened to the speeches of leaders (Political or non-political)?
People often find these speeches monotonous and hopeless. The leaders also
sometimes feel very embarrassed about their speeches and they are often
afraid of covering the same topics in two different speeches. You can save our
intelligent leaders from these kinds of embarrassments. For example, lets
consider that a leader has the following topics in his mind

a) War

b) Terror

c) Peace

d) Nuclear-Bomb

e) Human-Right

f) Food

g) Oil-Crisis

h) Equal-Right

He delivers speeches on any two of these topics at once but never wants to cover the topics Oil-
Crisis and War in the same speech. The same thing applies for the topics Nuclear-Bomb and
Equal-Right. You can help him by making all possible combinations of topics (Of course considering
the restrictions supplied by him) so that he can choose any one from them according to his convenience
and can avoid any blunders. The specific details are given in the input and output specifications.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer n(n  100), which indicates how many sets of inputs
are there. The description of each set is given in the paragraph below:

The first line of each set has three integers t(0 < t < 16), p(0  p < t(t 1)/2), s(0 < s  5). Here
t denotes the number of topics in the leaders mind, p denotes the number of prohibited pairs and s is
the total number of topics the leader wants to cover in a single speech. The next t lines contain t topics
of the leaders mind. The topics are all different. Each topic will contain only alphanumeric characters
and hyphens. Each of the next p lines contains two different topics in each line separated by a single
space. These pairs of topics should not come in the same speech. Same pair of topics may appear more
than once in the input. Each topic has a maximum length of 15.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set you should first print the serial of that set. Each of the next lines should contain all the
possible topic groups. The topics in each group should be separated by a single space. Print a blank
line after the output for each set of input. In a group the topics should be printed in the descending
order of their lengths. If lengths of two topics are same the lexicographically smaller one should come
first. This order should also be maintained in the printing order of the groups.

Topics should be considered case insensitive. While printing the topics print all the characters as
uppercase. Print a blank line after the output for each case.
