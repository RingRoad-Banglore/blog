## Input

```

Let us consider paths in the plane integer lattice Z  Z consisting only of steps (1,1) and (1,-1) and
which never pass below the x-axis. A peak at height k is then defined as a point on the path with
coordinate y = k that is immediately preceded by a (1,1) step and immediately followed by a (1,-1)
step. The pictures below show two such paths: on the left picture we have 4 peaks (2 peaks at height
2 and 2 peaks at height 3); while on the right picture we have 3 peaks (1 peak at height 1, 1 peak at
height 2 and 1 peak at height 3).

The problem consists of counting the number of admissible paths starting at (0,0) and ending at
(2n, 0) with exactly r peaks at height k.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them consists of one line with the natural numbers n,
r and k which define the problem (first number gives n, second number r, and the last one k). Assume
that 1  n < 20, 0  r < 20, and 1  k < 20.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output is a single integer on a line by itself, answering the problem, being
guaranteed to be less than 231.

```

## Sample Output

```
3 1 2

10 3 2
