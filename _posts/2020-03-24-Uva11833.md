title: Uva 11833  Route Change
---


## Input

```text
The road system of a country connects all N cities so that it is possible to travel between any pair of
cities using existing roads. Each road connects two different cities, is two-way and one has exactly one
toll booth (a toll is paid for both directions of traffic). Roads intersect only in a city and no pair of
cities is interconnected by two or more roads.

Dias Tranport offers a one-day parcel delivery service between cities. Each parcel must be trans-
ported from a city A to another city B. The management of Dias Transport defines, for each parcel, a
service route, consisting of C cities and C  1 roads: the first city on the service route is the origin of
the parcel, the final city is the destination of the parcel. The service route never passes twice through
the same city, and the vehicle chosen to deliver a parcel can only travel by the service route defined.

One day, however, a vehicle broke down and was taken for repairs in a city that was not among the
cities in its service route. The management of Dias Transport wants to know which is the lowest total
cost, in terms of tolls, for delivering the parcel (that is, to take the vehicle from the city it was repaired
to the destination city), but with an additional constraint: if at some point the vehicle reaches one of
the cities that make up its service route, it should go back to following its service route.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contais four integers N , M , C and K
(4  N  250, 3  M  N  (N  1)/2, 2  C  N  1 e C  K  N  1), representing, respectively,
the number of cities, the number of roads, the number of cities in the service route and the city where
the vehicle was taken for repair. The cities are identified by integers from 0 to N 1. The service route
is 0, 1, . . . , C  1, that is, the origin is 0, from 0 goes to 1, from 1 to 2 and so on, until the destination
C  1. The next M lines describe the road system. Each of those lines describes one road and contains
three integers U , V and P (0  U , V  N  1, U = V , 0  P  250), indicating that there exists a
road connecting cities U and V with a toll of cost P .

The last test case is followed by a line containing four zeros separated by blank spaces.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, your program should print a single line, containing a single integer, the minimum
total toll cost for the vehicle to reach the destination city.
