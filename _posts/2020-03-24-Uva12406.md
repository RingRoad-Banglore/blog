## Input

```text
You know Dexter, right? He is a very talented young scientist. He has
a huge lab hidden inside his building. He made all possible security
arrangement to keep his naughty sister Dee Dee away from his lab. But
she always finds a way into the lab. One day Dee Dee came to the
lab and started her usual work, messing up Dexters lab! Dexter was
working on a very important project, so he begged to her and said,
Please!!! Not today. I will do anything for you, but please leave this
lab today!!! Dee Dee was waiting for this chance, she said, Ok, you
do my homework I wont disturb you today. What can Dexter do? He
agreed. Dee Dee said, My teacher told me to write down 17 numbers.
First one single digit number, second one two digit number, ..., n-th
one n digit number. They will consist of only digit 1 and 2 and the
n-th number should be divisible by 2n. Dexter thought, I have very little time to finish the project.
I cant waste my time for this silly problem, I have bigger problem to think! So, he sent the modified
version of this problem to you. Hurry up, Dee Dee is waiting.

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 300), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with two integers: p q (1  p, q  17).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number first. Then you have to find two integers (smallest and largest)
which have p digits and is divisible by 2q. The integers should contain only 1s and 2s. If no result is
found, print impossible. If there is only one integer, then print that integer. Otherwise print both
integers (first the smallest one then the largest one) separated by a single space.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
2 2
2 1
2 3
