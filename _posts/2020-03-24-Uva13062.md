```
After leaving the pharmacy with grandma, Eloi has realized there are still some interesting mathematical
puzzles regarding grannys pill taking routine.

Grannys memory pills come in two sizes: large and small. The dose in each large pill is equivalent
to that in two small ones. Eloi observes granny picks a pill at random from the bottle every day: if its
a small one, she takes it; otherwise she splits it and takes a half, replacing the other which is from then
on considered a small pill.

Eloi would like to solve the following puzzles regarding a given bottle with l large pills and s small
pills:

1. What is the expected number of small pills remaining when the last large pill is picked?

2. What is the expected day in which the last large pill is picked?

Your task is to help Eloi solve those puzzles.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of a line with two blank separated
numbers l and s (0  l  100 and 0  s  100).

The end of the input is given by l = s = 0, which should not be processed as a test case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line with two blank-separated numbers a1 and a2: a1 is the answer to
question 1 and a2 to question 2 above. Each ai must approximate the correct answer to within 106.
