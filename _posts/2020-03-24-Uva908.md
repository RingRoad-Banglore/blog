title: Uva 00908  Reconnecting Computer Sites
---


## Input

```

Consider the problem of selecting a set T of high-speed lines for connecting N computer sites, from a
universe of M high-speed lines each connecting a pair of computer sites. Each high-speed line has a
given monthly cost, and the objective is to minimize the total cost of connecting the N computer sites,
where the total cost is the sum of the cost of each line included in set T . Consider further that this
problem has been solved earlier for the set of N computer sites and M high-speed lines, but that a few
K new high-speed lines have recently become available.

Your objective is to compute the new set T  that may yield a cost lower than the original set T ,
due to the additional K new high-speed lines and when M +K high-speed lines are available.
```

## Output

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive
test cases are separated by a single blank line.

The input is organized as follows:

 A line containing the number N of computer sites, with 1  N  1000000, and where each
computer site is referred by a number i, 1  i  N .

 The set T of previously chosen high-speed lines, consisting of N  1 lines, each describing a
high-speed line, and containing the numbers of the two computer sites the line connects and the
monthly cost of using this line. All costs are integers.

 A line containing the number K of new additional lines, 1  K  10.

 K lines, each describing a new high-speed line, and containing the numbers of the two computer
sites the line connects and the monthly cost of using this line. All costs are integers.

 A line containing the number M of originally available high-speed lines, with N  1  M 
N(N  1)/2.

 M lines, each describing one of the originally available high-speed lines, and containing the num-
bers of the two computer sites the line connects and the monthly cost of using this line. All costs
are integers.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The output file must have one line containing the original cost of connecting the N computer sites
with M high-speed lines and another line containing the new cost of connecting the N computer sites
with M +K high-speed lines. If the new cost equals the original cost, the same value is written twice.
