title: Uva 10989  Bomb Divide and Conquer
---


```
War is Gods way of teaching Americans geography.

Ambrose Bierce (1842 - 1914)

The enemy has n cities connected by m roads. We have bombers that can destroy roads. The Bomb,
Divide and Conquer strategy dictates that if we separate the enemys cities from each other, then the
two (or more) pieces will be easier to secure. Bombing a road has a cost (fuel, risk factor, etc.) What
is the minimum total cost of bombing enough roads to ensure that there is some pair of cities that have
no path between them? A path is a sequence of connected roads.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with two
lines containing n (2  n  150) and m (0  m  n(n 1)/2). The next m lines contain m triples of
integers denoting two different cities (between 1 and n) that are connected by a road and the cost of
destroying that road (between 1 and 1000).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the total cost of disconnecting a
pair of cities.
