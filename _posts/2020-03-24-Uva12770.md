title: Uva 12770  Palinagram
---


## Input

```text

A palindrome is a word that is spelt the same backwards or forwards. Examples are level and
madam. An anagram is a word made from another word just by rearranging the characters, like
made to dame. For this problem anagrams and palindromes may not be valid English words. For
example daamm is an anagram of madam and amdma is also palindrome although it is not an
English word. daamm is also called a palinagram because it is the anagram of a palindrome. Any
palindrome is also a palinagram but the vice versa is not always true. Some other examples palinagrams
are aabbcc, aaaaa etc. Given a string you will have to print the string that needs to be appended
with it to make it a palinagram.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 6000 test cases. The description of each test case is given below.
Each case consists of a single string S of length L (1  L  500). This string contains only lowercase

English letters (a to z).
Input is terminated by a line containing a single hash (#) character. This line need not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. The line contains the string that needs to be appended
to the given string to make it a palinagram (Can be an empty string as well). If there are more than
one solutions output the shortest one, if there is still a tie output the lexicographically smallest one.
