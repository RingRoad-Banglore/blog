title: Uva 11981  Corrupted Friendship
---


## Input

```text
Many of us know a person named Mr. Haba Kom Khan. He is very corrupted and lazy. He maintains
links with a lot of (corrupted) persons. In order to corrupt more lazy persons, he invites his friends in
a recursive fashion in a meeting. The idea is:

If X has some cards, he keeps one card and he invites one of his friends Y who has no invitation
cards yet and X gives all the remaining cards to Y. Then we say that Y is invited by X. Y then
has the responsibility to distribute as many cards as he can, and Y keeps one card and continues the
same procedure as X. When Y cannot find any more friends to give the invitation cards, he gives the
remaining cards back to X. X then checks for his friends who have no cards yet. If any such friend is
found, X continues the same procedure. Otherwise, if X was invited by Z then X gives the remaining
cards back to Z. X keeps the cards if there is no such person.

Initially Mr. Haba has N invitations cards, and he starts the invitation process as stated. There
are N persons, and they are numbered from 1 to N . Mr. Haba is the person numbered 1. And the
strange fact is that, after the invitation process, each person gets exactly 1 card.

Given all the information of persons being invited by others, Mr. Haba wants you to find the total
number of invitations that was made. He also asks you to find the number of different pairs of persons
who are certainly not friends. Help Mr. Haba Kom Khan to succeed in his corrupted life!

## Output

```text
The first line of input will contain T ( 30) denoting the number of cases.

Each case starts with an integer N (1  N  105). Each of the next N  1 lines will contain two
integers, X and Y (1  X,Y  N , X = Y ) denoting that person Y received his invitation card from
person X. Input is huge. So, faster I/O methods (e.g. scanf, printf, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter)
are recommended.
