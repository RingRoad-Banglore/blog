## Input

```text
We would like to place n rooks, 1  n  5000, on a n n board
subject to the following restrictions

 The i-th rook can only be placed within the rectangle given
by its left-upper corner (xli, yli) and its right-lower corner
(xri, yri), where 1  i  n, 1  xli  xri  n, 1  yli 
yri  n.

 No two rooks can attack each other, that is no two rooks
can occupy the same column or the same row.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each of
them contains one integer number, n, the side of the board. n lines follow giving the rectangles where
the rooks can be placed as described above. The i-th line among them gives xli, yli, xri, and yri. The
input file is terminated with the integer 0 on a line by itself.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Your task is to find such a placing of rooks that the above conditions are satisfied and then output n
lines each giving the position of a rook in order in which their rectangles appeared in the input. If there
are multiple solutions, any one will do. Output IMPOSSIBLE if there is no such placing of the rooks.

```
