## Input

```

Consider an integer sequence consisting of N elements where

X1 = 1

X2 = 2

X3 = 3

Xi = (Xi1 +Xi2 +Xi3)%M + 1 for i = 4 to N

Find 2 values a and b so that the sequence (Xa Xa+1 Xa+2 . . . Xb1Xb) contains all the integers
from [1,K]. If there are multiple solutions then make sure (b a) is as low as possible.

In other words, find the smallest subsequence from the given sequence that contains all the integers
from 1 to K.

Consider an example where N = 20, M = 12 and K = 4.
The sequence is {1 2 3 7 1 12 9 11 9 6 3 7 5 4 5 3 1 10 3 3}.
The smallest subsequence that contains all the integers {1 2 3 4} has length 13 and is highlighted

in the following sequence:
{1 2 3 7 1 12 9 11 9 6 3 7 5 4 5 3 1 10 3 3}.
```

## Output

```
First line of input is an integer T (T < 100) that represents the number of test cases. Each case consists
of a line containing 3 integers N (2 < N < 1000001), M (0 < M < 1001) and K (1 < K < 101). The
meaning of these variables is mentioned above.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the case number followed by the minimum length of the subsequence. If there is
no valid subsequence, output sequence nai instead. Look at the sample for exact format.

```

## Sample Output

```
2

20 12 4

20 12 8
