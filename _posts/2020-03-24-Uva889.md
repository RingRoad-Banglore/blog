## Input

```
Now that the Eurotunnel between France and Great Britain is in operation, the French government
is thinking about a new project to expand the connections with their British neighbors. Inspired by
the movie Bridges of Madison County, their prime architect Clouseau has been working on a plan to
connect France to the Channel Islands by building a number of bridges.

To minimize the costs of the bridges, a necessity to get the plan approved, Clouseau has been
working hard to find the best places to build the bridges that connect the islands to France. He has
figured out that connecting each island to France individually is not the cheapest solution; it is cheaper
to construct a bridge between one island and France, and build additional bridges to connect the other
islands indirectly. Clouseau, however, is unable to find the best places to build the bridges because of
the irregular shapes of the islands.

By approximating the islands as circles, Clouseau was able to report his boss, Mr. Dreyfus, an
estimate of the length of the interconnecting bridges. Mr. Dreyfus, however, is not satisfied and
demands that Clouseau report by Monday the exact length of the bridges needed based on the actual
shapes of the Channel Islands. If Clouseau does not report on time he will be fired. Would you be
so kind to help out Clouseau and write a program that computes the minimum length of the bridges
needed to interconnect the Channel Islands?
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains the number of test cases. A test case consists of one line holding the
number of islands (2  N  100), followed by N lines that describe the islands. An island is a polygon,
which is described as a number (1  P  25) that gives the number of points followed by P pairs of
coordinates. Each coordinate is an integer in the range [1000..1000]. The points are listed in order
such that by connecting consecutive points, and the last point to the first, the perimeter of the island
is given. It is guaranteed that islands do not touch or intersect.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output one line reporting the minimal interconnect as follows:

The minimal interconnect consists of N bridges with a total length of L

Where N is the number of bridges, and L is the total length, which should be printed as a floating
point number with an accuracy of three digits.
