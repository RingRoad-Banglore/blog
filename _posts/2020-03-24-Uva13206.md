title: Uva 13206  Beautiful Triad
---


```
A numerical triad of limit N is a set of 3 numbers A, B and C where 0  A,B,C  N . A numerical
triad of limit N is considered a beautiful triad in base K, if and only if all the pairs that can be
formed between their values A, B and C differ by no more than K units.

For example (4, 4, 6) is a beautiful triad in base 3 because the difference between A and B is 0, the
difference between A and C is 2 and the difference between B and C is 2, all differences being less than
3. However, this is not a beautiful triad in base 1, because two of their differences are greater than 1.

Knowing N and K, can you tell how many different beautiful triads of limit N in base K can be
formed? Note that (4, 4, 6), (4, 6, 4) and (6, 4, 4) are three different triads.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T , the number of test cases. Each case contains two
integers N and K as described previously (0  N  2109, 0  K  1000, K  N).

```

## Output

```
Print one line per test case, the number of beautiful triads of limit N in base K that can be formed. It
is guaranteed that this number fits in a 64 bits signed integer.
