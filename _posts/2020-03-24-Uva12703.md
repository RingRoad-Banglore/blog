title: Uva 12703  Little Rakin

```

Little Rakin is learning Math. While learning the Fibonacci series, he is talking over the phone to his
paternal aunt who lives in New York. The Fibonacci series is:

F0 = 0

F1 = 1

Fn = Fn1 + Fn2, n > 1

But Rakin, who is listening to the visit that his uncles family paid in the statue of Liberty on the
phone, became very fascinated. He begins to imagine himself on the place, forgetting his present state.
Due to his loss in concentration, what Rakin writes is:

F0 = 0

F1 = 1

Fn = Fn1  Fn2, n > 1

Now, you have to solve a problem which is similar to Little Rakins Fibonacci series. Here is a
sequence given:

F0 = a

F1 = b

Fn = Fn1  Fn2, n > 1

Given a, b, and n, prime factorize Fn.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input will consist of the number of test cases T  100. Then T cases follows. For each
case, there is a line containing three number n, a, b, where :

 2  n  40

 2  a, b  1000

```

## Output

```
Print the prime factorization of Fn so that each prime number and its power will be in a single line
separated by single space. If there is more than one prime, then prime numbers should be printed in
increasing order. Print a blank line after each test case. For more clarification see the sample output
format given below.
