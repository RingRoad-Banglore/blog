12639 Hexagonal Puzzle

A hexagonal piece is a hexagon whose sides are labeled with distinct integers values between 1 and 6.
A Hexagonal Puzzle is a set of seven hexagonal pieces, e.g.,

A Hexagonal Puzzle is solvable if and only if its pieces can be translated and rotated, without
reflecting or flipping any of them, to form a honeycomb pattern where neighboring sides of any two
pieces are labeled with the same integer values. The following figure depicts a honeycomb pattern
witnessing the fact that the above hexagonal puzzle is solvable:

Your task is to determine if a given Hexagonal Puzzle is solvable or not.

## Input

The input contains several test cases, each one of them corresponding to the description of a Hexagonal
Puzzle. A case comprises seven lines, each one containing a blank-separated permutation of the numbers
1, 2, . . . , 6 indicating the clockwise labeling of the sides of a hexagonal piece of the puzzle.

## Output

For each case print one line with the word ‘YES’ if the given Hexagonal Puzzle is solvable, or the word
‘NO’ otherwise. Answers should be left aligned.
