title: Uva 12671  Disjoint water supply
---


```

Nlogonia is a queendom that consists of several cities located on a big mountain. The capital city
is Logville, located on the mountain peak. Logville has a huge lake with a perfectly round shape,
appropriately named The Big O. This is the only lake with drinkable water in the entire queendom,
so it is used to supply all cities. Some cities in Nlogonia are connected with water pipes that allow the
distribution of the water. As there are no pumps, each pipe carries water from a city to another city
at a lower altitude, using gravity.

Nlogonias water system has been a source of worries for the Queen, because since cities depend on
other cities for their water supply, hot discussions occur about how much water a city is allowed to use.
A water supply path is a sequence of cities in decreasing order of altitude, starting in Logville and such
that there is a pipe connecting each pair of consecutive cities in the sequence. Two cities have disjoint
water supply if and only if there exist two water supply paths, one supply path ending in each of the
cities, such that Logville is the only city that is present in both paths. Notice that Logville itself has
disjoint water supply with every other city.

The Queen considers disjoint water supply a nice property because it reduces dependency problems
and also avoids water outages to spread as quickly through Nlogonia. She therefore ordered a survey to
assess the current state of water supply disjointness in the whole queendom. Being the cleverest advisors
in the Queens court, you have been summoned to help calculate the number of pairs of distinct cities
that have disjoint water supply.

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line contains two integers C (2  C  1000) and P (1  P  105), representing respectively
the number of cities and the number of water pipes in Nlogonia. Cities are identified with different
integers from 1 to C, in strictly decreasing order of altitude (no two cities have the same altitude);
Logville is city 1. Each of the next P lines describes a pipe with two integers U and V (1  U < V  C)
indicating that the pipe connects city U with city V . You may assume that no two pipes connect the
same pair of cities, and that for each city in Nlogonia there is at least one water supply path that ends
in it.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line with an integer representing the number of pairs of distinct cities that
have disjoint water supply.
