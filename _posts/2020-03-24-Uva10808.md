Resistance will be punished.

Cooperation will be rewarded.
J. Michael Straczynski, "Babylon 5" and "Jeremiah".

Given a network of resistors, what is the equivalent resistance between two given points in the
network? More precisely, consider an undirected, weighted graph, where each edge is a wire with the
edge weight representing its resistance, in Ohms. Given a pair of nodes, A and B, in this graph, imagine
passing 1 Ampere of current from A to B. What will be the voltage between A and B, in Volts?

A brief review of high school physics. For any pair of points, P and Q, in the network, the voltage
between the points is the difference in potentials at the two points (V(P) - V(Q)) and is equal to the
current from P to Q times the resistance between P and Q. For any point in the network, the sum of
the currents entering the point is zero (conservation of charge).
Warning! This problem is harder than it seems.

## Input

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (N < 30). N test cases follow. Each one starts
with a description of a graph:
n m (the number of nodes and wires in the graph)
n will not be larger than 16. The next m lines contain 3 integers each:
u v r

specifying that there is a wire with resistance r (0 < r < 10) connecting node u to node v. The nodes
are numbered from 0 to n  1. There can be multiple wires connecting the same pair of nodes and
wires connecting a node to itself. The next line of each test case will contain the number of queries, Q
(0  Q  10). The next Q lines will list pairs of nodes A and B.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the line Case #x:, where x is the number of the test case. Then print Q
lines of the form Resistance between A and B is s/t, where s/t is a fraction in lowest terms.
Print 1/0 if no current can go from A to B. Finally, print an empty line after each test case.
