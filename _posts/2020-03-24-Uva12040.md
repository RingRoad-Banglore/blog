title: Uva 12040  Again Lucky Numbers
---


## Input

```
Some people believe that 13 is an unlucky number. So they always want to avoid the number 13. But
I believe that 7 is an unlucky number and want to avoid it. So unlucky number is different for man to
man. If 13 is an unlucky number and in a number there is no 13 (i.e. no 1 is followed by a 3) then we
can call it a lucky number. For example, if we consider 13 as an unlucky number then 12345 is a lucky
number. But if any number contains 13 then it is not a lucky number, such as 13254 and 21345 are
not lucky numbers. Given the number of digits N in a number and the unlucky number M, you have
to find out how many lucky numbers are possible with N digits considering that M is unlucky number.
Note that leading 0s are not allowed. So, 011 is not a valid three digit number.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer T (T  1000) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

Two positive integers N (1  N  100), M (1  M  10100).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print the number of lucky numbers of N digits considering that M is the unlucky
number. The result may be very large. You have to output the result modulo 10000007.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
1 3
