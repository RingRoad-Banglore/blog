title: Uva 00504  Random number
---


## Input

```text
A Black Box algorithm supposes that natural number sequence u(1), u(2), . . . , u(N) is sorted
in non-descending order, N  M and for each p (1  p  N) an inequality p  u(p)  M
is valid.

Making tests for this algorithm we have met with the following problem. For setting a random se-
quence {u(i)} a usual random data generator did not fit. As the sequence itself had been imposed certain
restrictions, the method of choosing the next random element (in the interval defined by restrictions)
did not give the random sequence as a whole.

We have come to a conclusion that the problem can be solved in the following way. If we arrange
all possible sequences in certain order (for example, in lexicographical order) and assign each sequence
its number, after choice of the random number it is possible to take the correspondent sequence for the
random one. At the first glance it seems enough to make up a program generating all these sequences in
such order. Alas! Even having not great values of M and N it would have taken any powerful modern
computer centuries to enumerate all such sequences. It turned out it was possible to avoid generating
all sequences if we managed to create required sequence according to its number immediately. But even
this statement does not cover all. As the amount of sequences is quite large, the number can be a long
one, composed of hundreds decimal digits, though our random data generator could give only normal
numbers. We decided to produce a long random number from a real random number distributed in
[0,1]. Namely, present the number in binary notation: 0.b1b2 . . . , where all bi = 0 or 1. Let us set a
regulation to associate such real number to an integer from [A,B] segment:

Formula

G(A,B, 0.b1b2 . . . bp) =




A, if p = 0 or A = B;

otherwise:
{

G(A, (A+B) div 2, 0.b2b3 . . . bp), if b1 = 0
G((A+B) div 2 + 1, B, 0.b2b3 . . . bp), if b1 = 1

Here we suppose, that A  B, p  0, and div 2 is an integer division by 2.

Let M , N (1  N  M  200) and a binary real number 0.b1b2 . . . bp (1  p  400) be given.
Write a program to find out the corresponding u(1), u(2), . . . , u(N) sequence, i.e. to find a sequence
with G(1, T, 0.b1b2 . . . bp) number in lexicographical order of all possible {u(i)} for the given M and N
(T is the quantity of such sequences). Numeration begins with 1.

Keep in mind that in lexicographical order {l(i)} proceeds {h(i)} if after omitting equal beginnings,
the first number of {l(i)} tail is smaller than the first number or {h(i)} tail.

Following example illustrates the list of all possible sequences for M = 4 and N = 3 in lexicographical
order.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input is an integer K, then a blank line followed by K datasets. There is a blank
line between datasets.

The first line of each dataset contains M and N . The second line contains binary real number
0.b1b2 . . . bp (without leading, trailing and other spaces).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each dataset, write into the output data file the corresponding sequence u(1), u(2), . . . , u(N). The
sequence numbers should be separated with spaces and end-of-line characters.

There should be up to 20 numbers in each line. If neccesary, the numbers will have leading blanks
to occupy 3 characters. Print a blank line between datasets.

A note (it does not concern the solution of this task):
The choice of random binary vector 0.b1b2 . . . bp does not give an absolute uniform random data

generator if we use the Formula. However, taking into account the fact that [A,B] interval is big we
shall obtain a distribution applicable in most cases.
