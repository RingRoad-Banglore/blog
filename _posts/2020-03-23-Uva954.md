954 Tetravex Solver

In the so-called tetravex puzzle, MN square pieces are to be placed side-by-side inside an M × N
rectangle so that touching sides have the same number.

Given 16 different square pieces, arrange them in a 4×4 square. Touching sides must have the same
number. The following figure illustrates what is desired.

## Input

The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive
test cases are separated by a single blank line.

Each piece is encoded by four consecutive one digit numbers, each of which represented in the ASCII
character set; 0 will be represented by ascii(48), i.e., by ’0’ in the C language, 1 by ascii(49), and so
on, up to 9 (ascii(57)). The four digits represent, from left to right, the one digit numbers associated
with the right, up, left, and down sides.

For example, the string "3195" (the double-quotation marks will not be present in
the input) represents the square piece shown on the right.

This representation must also be used in the output. There must be at least one
white space character between the piece representations. A white space character is
either a space, i.e., ascii(32), ’ ’ in the C language, or a new line character (also known as the line
feed character), i.e., ascii(10), ’\n’ in the C language. There may exist white space characters both
before the description of the first piece and after the description of the last piece. If any other characters
(i.e., not a digit nor a white space) are present then the input is not valid. The input is also not valid
when there are repeated pieces. Two pieces are equal if and only if they have the same representation.

## Output

For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The first line of the output must contain a single digit, represented in the ASCII character set,
immediately followed by the new line character. This digit must be

• 0, if the input is not valid, or

• 1, if the input is valid and there are no solutions, or

• 2, if the input is valid and there is only one solution, or

• 3, if the input is valid and there are two or more solutions.

If there is only one solution, the output must have 4 more lines, each of which containing the pieces
of one row of the solution, top row first. Each of these 4 lines must contain the representation of the
4 pieces of the corresponding row, left piece first. There must exist a single space character between
piece representations of the same row. Each line must be terminated by a new line character.
