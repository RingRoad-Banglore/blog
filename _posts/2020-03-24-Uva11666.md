## Input

```
From time immemorial different series has been an integrated
part of mathematics. Series is very important for finding values
of many important functions such as sin(x), ex, ln(x), etc. The
well known formula for finding the value of ln(1 x) is shown
below:

ln(1 x) = x
x2

2


x3

3


x4

4
 ... to . Here |x| < 1

However as this formula is true when x is less than 1, a
modification is needed to find the formula for any integer. For
any integer n the following relationship is true:

ln(n) = L x
x2

2


x3

3


x4

4
 ... to .

Here |x| < 1 and it is a real number, n is a positive integer and L is a non-negative integer.
But for a given integer n, L can have more than one value. Your job is to find the smallest possible

value of L and for that L find the value of x.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains around 10000 line of input. Each line contains a single integer n (0 < n < 2311).
Input is terminated by a line containing a zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains one integer followed by one floating
point number. The integer number denotes the smallest possible value of L and floating-point number
denotes the corresponding value of x. This floating-point number should have eight digits after the
decimal point.
