title: Uva 11049  Basic wall maze
---


## Input

```
In this problem you have to solve a very simple maze consisting of:

1. a 6 by 6 grid of unit squares

2. 3 walls of length between 1 and 6 which are placed either horizontally or vertically to separate
squares

3. one start and one end marker

A maze may look like this:

You have to find a shortest path between the square with the start marker and the square with
the end marker. Only moves between adjacent grid squares are allowed; adjacent means that the grid
squares share an edge and are not separated by a wall. It is not allowed to leave the grid.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of five lines: The first line contains
the column and row number of the square with the start marker, the second line the column and row
number of the square with the end marker. The third, fourth and fifth lines specify the locations of the
three walls. The location of a wall is specified by either the position of its left end point followed by
the position of its right end point (in case of a horizontal wall) or the position of its upper end point
followed by the position of its lower end point (in case of a vertical wall). The position of a wall end
point is given as the distance from the left side of the grid followed by the distance from the upper side
of the grid.

You may assume that the three walls dont intersect with each other, although they may touch at
some grid corner, and that the wall endpoints are on the grid. Moreover, there will always be a valid
path from the start marker to the end marker. Note that the sample input specifies the maze from the
picture above.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print a description of a shortest path from the start marker to the end marker. The
description should specify the direction of every move (N for up, E for right, S for down and W for
left).

There can be more than one shortest path, in this case you can print any of them.
