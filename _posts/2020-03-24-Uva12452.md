title: Uva 12452  Plants vs Zombies HD Super Pro
---


## Input

```
Plants versus Zombies HD Super Pro is a game
played not a grid, but on a connected graph G
with no cycles (i.e., a tree). Zombies live on
edges of the tree and chew through edges so
that tree falls apart! Plants can be purchased
and placed on vertices of the tree to protect
the tree from falling apart. It is not possible to
plant more than one plant on the same vertex.
A plant protects one or more adjacent edges,
depending on the strength and capabilities of
the plant.

The Almanac offers you to buy any of three
different types of plants:

 PEASHOOTERS: These are your first line of defense and can shoot peas along any one edge (of
your choosing) adjacent to the vertex upon which it is placed. Cost: $100 per plant.

 SPLIT PEAS: These are hard working pea shooters and can shoot peas along any two edges (of
your choosing) adjacent to the vertex upon which it is placed. Cost: $175 per plant.

 STARFRUIT: Having just visited the dentist, a STARFRUIT is very upset and shoots stars along
all edges adjacent to the vertex upon which it is placed. Cost: $500 per plant.

Your goal is to protect the tree from the Zombies by having every edge covered by at least one
plant, and doing so spending the least amount of money. You can buy more than one of each type of
plant, but you can only plant at most one plant on each vertex.
```

## Output

```
The input starts with an integer T  the number of test cases (T  100). T cases follow, each starting
with the integer N on the first line, the number of vertices in G (2  N  10, 000). N  1 line follows,
each containing two space separated integers u and v (0  u, v  N  1, u = v)  describing an edge.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print on a separate line the minimum cost of protecting the tree, formatted like in
the sample output.

Note: In the second case we can put a Split Pea on the vertex 1.
