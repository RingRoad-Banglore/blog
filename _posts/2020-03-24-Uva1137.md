title: Uva 01137  Phony primes
---


## Input

```text
You are chief debugger for Poorly Guarded Privacy, Inc. One of the top selling product, ReallySe-
cureAgent, seems to have a problem with its prime number generator. It produces from time to time
bogus primes N . After a while, you realize that the problem is due to the way primes are recognized.

Every phony prime N you discover can be characterized as follows. It is odd and has distinct prime
factors, say N = p1  p2  . . .  pk with pi = pj , where the number k of factors is at least 3. Moreover,
for all i = 1..k, pi  1 divides N  1. For instance, 561 = 3  11  17 is a phony prime.

Intrigued by this phenomenon, you decide to write a program that enumerates all such N s in a
given interval [Nmin, Nmax], with 1  Nmin < Nmax < 231, Nmax Nmin < 106.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases, each of them following the description below. A blank line separates
two consecutive cases.

Each test file contains one line. On this line are written the two integers Nmin and Nmax separated
by a blank.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the list of phony primes in increasing order, one per line. If there are no
phony prime in the interval, then simply output none on a line.

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 2000

20000 21000
