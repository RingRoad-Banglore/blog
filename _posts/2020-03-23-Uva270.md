270 Lining Up
“How am I ever going to solve this problem?” said the pilot.

Indeed, the pilot was not facing an easy task. She had to drop packages at specific points scattered
in a dangerous area. Furthermore, the pilot could only fly over the area once in a straight line, and she
had to fly over as many points as possible. All points were given by means of integer coordinates in a
two-dimensional space. The pilot wanted to know the largest number of points from the given set that
all lie on one line. Can you write a program that calculates this number?

Your program has to be efficient!

## Input
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The input consists of N pairs of integers, where 1 < N < 700. Each pair of integers is separated by
one blank and ended by a new-line character. The list of pairs is ended with an end-of-file character.
No pair will occur twice.

## Output
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

The output consists of one integer representing the largest number of points that all lie on one line.

## Sample Input
<p>1</p><p></p><p>1 1</p><p>2 2</p><p>3 3</p><p>9 10</p><p>10 11</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
