title: Uva 00677  All Walks of length n from the first node
---


```
A computer network can be represented as a graph. Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph, V =
(v1, v2, v3, . . . , vm) represents all nodes, where m is the number of nodes, and E represents all edges.
The first node is v1 and the last node is vm . The number of edges is k. Define the adjacency matrix
A = (aij)mm where

aij = 1 if {vi, vj}  E, otherwise aij = 0

An example of the adjacency matrix and its corresponding graph are as follows:


0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 0




Calculate
An = A A   A  

n

and use the Boolean operations where 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 =
1, 1 + 1 = 1, and 0  0 = 0  1 = 1  0 = 0, 1  1 = 1. The entry in
row i and column j of An is 1 if and only if at least there exists
a walk of length n between the i-th and j-th nodes of V. In other words, the distinct walks of length n
between the i-th and j-th nodes of V may be more than one. Note that the node in the paths can be
repetitive.

The following example shows the walks of length 2.

A2 = A A =




0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 0


 




0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 0


 =




1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1




Write programs to do above calculation and print out all distinct walks of length n. (In this problem
we let the maximum walks of length n be 5 and the maximum number of nodes be 10.)
```

## Input

```
The input file contains a number of test examples, the test examples are separated by -9999. Each
test example consists of the number of nodes and the length of walks in the first row, and then the
adjacency matrix.

```

## Output

```
The output file must contain all distinct walks of the length n, and with all its nodes different, from the
first node, listed in lexicographical order. In case there are not walks of length n, just print no walk
of length n

Separate the output of the different cases by a blank line.
