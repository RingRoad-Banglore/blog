## Input

```
The infamous University of Kala Jadu (UKJ) have been operating underground for the last fourteen
centuries training very select few students the dangerous art of black magic. However, with the recent
trend of going digital, they too wanted to try out a bit of public exposure by enrolling students in their
new distance education program.

Within the first three semesters they have got 6,789 students enrolled. The forkaclone spell allows
them to clone their teachers to train at most 10,000 students in a running semester. But they do not
have the server capacity to handle 10,000 students to register for their courses right at the beginning
of the semester during their 4-day registration period. Sadly, their art of black magic (or kala jadu, as
they say), only works on humans, it cannot be extended to their web server running on a Pentium IV
machine.

UKJ server administrators realized that if they could split the load on the server and balance it
somehow, then they can still handle 10,000 students per semester. Their idea is to divide the students
into roughly 4 equal groups A, B, C and D. Each group would then be given one day to register; no
other group can register on that same day  they will get their turn. They wanted to use total number
of credits completed by a student as the deciding factor to assign students to the 4 different groups. As
the students who would register can have completed any integer number of credits between 0 to 160,
one easy group assignment would be:
0 - 40 credits completed: group A
41 - 80 credits completed: group B
81 - 120 credits completed: group C
121 - 160 credits completed: group D

A bit of analysis of the number of students that may fall in these groups revealed that the number
of students in each group vary greatly. So this particular idea of splitting students into 4 groups to
balance the server load does not quite work out.

UKJ seeks your help in finding the credit boundaries that can create an optimal distribution of
students so that each group roughly have the same number of students. Youd suggest three integers
a, b and c to distribute the students as follows:
0 - a credits completed: group A
a+ 1 - b credits completed: group B
b+ 1 - c credits completed: group C
c+ 1 - 160 credits completed: group D

If the total number of students is N , the best possible scenario would place N/4 students in each
group. You need to minimize the sum of difference, d between N/4 and the number of student you
place in each group. For example, given N = 8 students to distribute, if you divide them into a group
of 3, 0, 3, 2 students then the difference with N/4 for the groups would be 1, 2, 1, 0 respectively. This
results in 1+ 2+1+0 = 4 as sum of differences. This is what youd have to minimize. Note that, N/4
can be a floating point number.

## Output

```
The input description for the problem starts with T (1 < T  100)  the number of test cases, then
T test cases follow. The first line of each case starts with the number of students N (0 < N  10000).
The next N lines contains the number of credits (always integer), Ci (0  Ci  160) the i-th student
have completed prior to this registration.

## Sample Input

```
Output for each test case will start with the test case label (starting with 1, and formatted as shown in
sample output.) The label will be followed by three integers, a, b and c (0  a < b < c < 160) denoting
the group boundaries as described in the problem. If there are multiple such boundaries possible with
the same d value, then pick the solution that has the smallest a value. If there is a tie, then pick the
one with the smallest b value. If even that fails to break the tie, then pick the solution with the smallest
c value.
