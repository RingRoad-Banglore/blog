## Input

```text
Archeologists from the Antiquities and Curios
Museum (ACM) have flown to Egypt to ex-
amine the great pyramid of Key-Ops. Us-
ing state-of-the-art technology they are able
to determine that the lower floor of the pyra-
mid is constructed from a series of straight-
line walls, which intersect to form numerous
enclosed chambers. Currently, no doors exist
to allow access to any chamber. This state-
of-the-art technology has also pinpointed the
location of the treasure room. What these ded-
icated (and greedy) archeologists want to do
is blast doors through the walls to get to the
treasure room. However, to minimize the dam-
age to the artwork in the intervening chambers
(and stay under their government grant for dy-
namite) they want to blast through the mini-
mum number of doors. For structural integrity
purposes, doors should only be blasted at the
midpoint of the wall of the room being entered. You are to write a program which determines this
minimum number of doors.

An example is shown on the right.

## Output

```text
The input will consist of several cases.The first line of the input contains the number of cases, and its
followed bya blank line.

The first line of each case will be an integer n (0  n  30) specifying number of interior walls,
followed by n lines containing integer endpoints of each wall x1y1x2y2. The 4 enclosing walls of the
pyramid have fixed endpoints at (0,0), (0,100), (100,100) and (100,0) and are not included in the list of
walls. The interior walls always span from one exterior wall to another exterior wall and are arranged
such that no more than two walls intersect at any point. You may assume that no two given walls
coincide. After the listing of the interior walls there will be one final line containing the floating point
coordinates of the treasure in the treasure room (guaranteed not to lie on a wall).

Different cases are separated by a blank line.

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print a single line listing the minimum number of doors which need to be created, in the
format shown below.

Print a blank line between cases.
