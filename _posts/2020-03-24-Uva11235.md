title: Uva 11235  Frequent values
---


## Input

```text
You are given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, . . . , an in non-decreasing order. In addition to that, you
are given several queries consisting of indices i and j (1  i  j  n). For each query, determine the
most frequent value among the integers ai, . . . , aj .
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers n and
q (1  n, q  100000). The next line contains n integers a1, . . . , an (100000  ai  100000, for each
i  {1, ..., n}) separated by spaces. You can assume that for each i  {1, . . . , n  1}: ai  ai+1. The
following q lines contain one query each, consisting of two integers i and j (1  i  j  n), which
indicate the boundary indices for the query.

The last test case is followed by a line containing a single 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query, print one line with one integer: The number of occurrences of the most frequent value
within the given range.

Note: A naive algorithm may not run in time!

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 3
-1 -1 1 1 1 1 3 10 10 10
2 3
1 10
5 10
0

```
