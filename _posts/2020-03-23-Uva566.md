566 Adam’s Genes
You’ve been hired by Gemini Labs, the world leader in human cloning, to write decision support
software. At Gemini, all clones are derived from “ADAM”, a genetically perfect human. Something
about his DNA makes him much easier to clone than normal humans. Not all the clones of Adam are
the same, though, because geneticists introduce mutations, in the form of recessive genes, to learn more
about genetics. For example, Bob might be a clone of Adam with a recessive gene for baldness added.
Scientists would study Bob to see what subtle effects the gene may have. Clones of Bob would carry the
recessive gene, as would clones of those clones, and so on. All is well as long as no clone derived from
Bob is given a second recessive baldness gene. If that were to happen, a bald clone would be produced
and the Cloning Board would shut Gemini down.

The software you are to write takes cloning requests from the research staff and evaluates them
for consistency and safety. A collection of requests is “inconsistent” if it includes a clone that is not
descended from Adam. A collection of requests is “unsafe” if it produces a clone with two identical
recessive genes.

## Input
Your program consumes a file of cloning requests, one per line. Here is the format of a cloning request:
< request > = clone_< name >_from_< name >< genelist >
< genelist > = NULL|_mutating_< gene >< genes >
< genes > = NULL|_< gene >< genes >
< gene > = 3 upper case alphabetical characters
< name > = 1 to 10 upper case alphabetical characters
_ = one blank

A typical cloning request is

clone BOB from ADAM mutating BLD HEM

Note: there is always exactly one space between words; the last character on a line is immediately
followed by EOLN. There can be zero to ten mutations in a request. If there are no mutations in the
request, the keyword “mutating” does not appear, e.g.,

clone BOB from ADAM

The input is guaranteed to satisfy the syntactic format specifications, and it is guaranteed to contain
at most one cloning request per clone, i.e., “clone BOB” will appear no more than once as the beginning
of an input line. Furthermore, you are to process requests as though only those definitions which precede
it are in effect. Therefore, if you have the following input segment

clone BOB from ADAM
clone MIKE from TIM
clone TIM from BOB

your output would include

clone MIKE from TIM has no connection to ADAM



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 566 – Adam’s Genes 2/2

because at the time MIKE was cloned, there was no connection to ADAM. If an clone is not consistent
and safe, then all subsequent clones from that clone should be reported as having no connection to
ADAM. For example, if you have the following input segment

clone BOB from ADAM mutating BLD
clone CHARLIE from BOB mutating BLD
clone DAVID from CHARLIE

your output would include

clone BOB from ADAM is consistent and safe
clone CHARLIE from BOB was at least twice mutated with BLD
clone DAVID from CHARLIE has no connection to ADAM

You are also guaranteed that no gene is listed twice in the same request.

## Output
Your program produces a file of the processed requests, one per line, in the same order as they were
consumed. The requests are modified according to the following rules.

1. If a clone is consistent and safe, the line should have the format
clone JOE from ADAM is consistent and safe

2. If a clone is inconsistent, the line should indicate this as follows
clone < name > from < name > has no connection to ADAM

3. If a clone is unsafe, the line should indicate this as follows
clone < name > from < name > was at least twice mutated with < gene >
where < gene > is the first gene to appear in the clone’s mutation list that is a second mutation
from Adam. You should print ONLY the first such doubly mutated gene.

If a particular cloning request is inconsistent, there is no need to report whether or not it is safe.
Your output should contain exactly one space between words and no leading or trailing spaces.

## Sample Input
<p>clone JOE from ADAM</p><p>clone BOB from ADAM mutating HEM</p><p>clone SAM from BOB mutating BLD</p><p>clone ED from SAM mutating BLD</p><p>clone FRANK from ED mutating HEM</p><p>clone KAIN from ABEL</p><p>clone ABEL from KAIN</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>clone JOE from ADAM is consistent and safe</p><p>clone BOB from ADAM is consistent and safe</p><p>clone SAM from BOB is consistent and safe</p><p>clone ED from SAM was at least twice mutated with BLD</p><p>clone FRANK from ED has no connection to ADAM</p><p>clone KAIN from ABEL has no connection to ADAM</p><p>clone ABEL from KAIN has no connection to ADAM</p>
