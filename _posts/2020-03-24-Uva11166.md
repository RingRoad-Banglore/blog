You are probably familiar with the binary representation of inte-
gers, i.e. writing a nonnegative integer n as


ai2

i, where each ai is
either 0 or 1. In this problem, we consider a so called signed binary
representation, in which we still write n as


ai2

i, but allow ai to take
on the values -1, 0 and 1. We write a signed binary representation of a
number as a vector (ak, ak1, . . . , a1, a0). For instance, n = 13 can be
represented as (1, 0, 0,1,1) = 24  21  20.

The binary representation of a number is unique, but obviously,
the signed binary representation is not. In certain applications (e.g.
cryptography), one seeks to write a number n in signed binary rep-
resentation with as few non-zero digits as possible. For example, we
consider the representation (1, 0, 0, -1) to be a better representation of
n = 7 than (1, 1, 1). Your task is to write a program which will find
such a minimal representation.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases (at most 25), one per line. Each test case consists of a positive
integer n  250000 written in binary without leading zeros. The input is terminated by a case where
n = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input, output one line containing the signed binary representation of n that has the
minimum number of non-zero digits, using the characters - for -1, 0 for 0 and + for +1. The number
should be written without leading zeros. If there are several possible answers, output the one that is
lexicographically smallest (by the ASCII ordering).

## Sample Input

```
10000
1111
10111
0

```

## Sample Output

```
+0000
+000-
++00-
