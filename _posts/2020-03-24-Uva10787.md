title: Uva 10787  Modular Equations

## Input

```
The laws of modular arithmetic are among the best weapons that we have in our arsenal. We, the
wannabe computer scientists, frequently use those laws to keep things manageable. For example if we
are to compute the units digit of

23513714  24514732

we would be able to do that in a flash. However if it requires dealing with equations involving modular
arithmetic, many of us may not feel just as comfortable. Fear not; were not going to daunt you with a
system of gruesome modular equations we would keep it small and simple.

Given the range of three integers a (amin  a  amax), b (bmin  b  bmax) and m (mmin 
m  mmax) you are to find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the equation:

(a+ b) mod m = (a b) mod m

Here is a sample.
1  a  2,2  b  4,3  m  5

(a + b) mod m = (a  b) mod m
(1 + 2) mod 4 3 (1  2) mod 4
(1 + 3) mod 3 1 (1  3) mod 3
(1 + 4) mod 4 1 (1  4) mod 4
(2 + 2) mod 4 0 (2  2) mod 4
(2 + 3) mod 3 2 (2  3) mod 3
(2 + 4) mod 4 2 (2  4) mod 4
```

## Output

```
There can be multiple test cases. The first line of the input gives you the number of test cases T
(1  T  20). Each of the next T line would contain the input for each test case. The input for each
test is given by 3 pairs of integer amin, amax, bmin, bmax and mmin, mmax. You can assume that,

 1000  amin  amax  +1000

 1000  bmin  bmax  +1000

 +1  mmin  mmax  +1000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each of the test case you need to print the serial number of the test case first. Then on the same
line you have to print the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy our modular equation.
