## Input

```
In the Republic of Remoteland, the people celebrate their independence day every year. However, as
it was a long long time ago, nobody can remember when it was exactly. The only thing people can
remember is that today, the number of days elapsed since their independence (D) is a perfect square,
and moreover it is the largest possible such number one can form as a product of distinct numbers less
than or equal to n.

As the years in Remoteland have 1, 000, 000, 007 days, their citizens just need D modulo
1, 000, 000, 007. Note that they are interested in the largest D, not in the largest D modulo
1, 000, 000, 007.
```

## Output

```
Every test case is described by a single line with an integer n, (1  n  10, 000, 000). The input ends
with a line containing 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the number of days ago the Republic became independent, modulo
1, 000, 000, 007, one per line.

```

## Sample Output
