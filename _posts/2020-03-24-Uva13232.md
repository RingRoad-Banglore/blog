title: Uva 13232  Do Pillars Again
---


## Input

```
Assuming that there are N pillars, and we need to put onto the pillars, a bunch of balls, i.e., numbered
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . , in increasing order such that on the same pillar, the sum of the numbers of any 2 adjacent
balls is a cube (k3 for positive integer k). Calculate the maximum number of balls that can be placed
on the N pillars. You may put the ball on any pillar, but no balls can be skipped. The process stops
once you cannot not place a ball.
```

## Output

```
A number of of inputs ( 1000), each with N (0 < N  2000000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input, output the total number of balls on one line.

```

## Sample Output
