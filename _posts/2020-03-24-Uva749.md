title: Uva 00749  Machine Repair Simulation
---


```
A system is composed of 1, 2, or 3 machines and a repairman responsible for maintaining these machines.
Normally, the machines are running and producing a product. At random points in time, the machines
fail and are fixed by the repairman. If a second or third machine fails while the repairman is busy fixing
the first machine, these machines will wait on the services of the repairman in a first come, first served
order. When repair on a machine is complete, the machine will begin running again and producing a
product. The repairman will then repair the next machine waiting. When all machines are running,
the repairman becomes idle.

Write a program that will simulate this system for a fixed period of time and calculate the fraction
of time the machines are busy (utilization) and the fraction of time the repairman is busy (utilization).
Machines are busy when producing parts and the repairman is busy when repairing machines.
```

## Input

```
The input file is composed of three parts each separated by a header record. The first part is a list
of 50 random machine running times until failure. The second part is a list of 50 random machine
repair times. The third part is a list of the cases to be simulated. Each case specifies the length of the
simulation and the number of machines assigned to the repairman. Cases end with the specification
of a 0 length and an assignment of 0 machines. Each case will use the same random machine running
times and repair times, starting at the beginning.

## Output

```
A sample with the details of the output file (print results accurately rounded to 3 decimal places) is
provided below. Diagrams are also provided to illustrate the simulation process.

Case 1 Simulation

Machine Utilization = (7 + 3.5)/20 = .525
Repairman Utilization = (9.5)/20 = .475

Case 2 Simulation



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 749  Machine Repair Simulation 2/2

Machine Utilization = ((7+3)+(4.5+6)+(13))/(3*20) = .558
Repairman Utilization = (15.5)/20 = .775
