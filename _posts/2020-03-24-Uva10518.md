title: Uva 10518  How Many Calls?
---


## Input

```text
The fibonacci number is defined by the following recurrence:

 fib(0) = 0

 fib(1) = 1

 fib(n) = fib(n 1) + fib(n 2)

But were not interested in the fibonacci numbers here. We would like to know how many calls does
it take to evaluate the n-th fibonacci number if we follow the given recurrence. Since the numbers are
going to be quite large, wed like to make the job a bit easy for you. Wed only need the last digit of
the number of calls, when this number is represented in base b.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. For each test youd be given two integers n (0  n < 263  1), b
(0 < b  10000). Input is terminated by a test case where n = 0 and b = 0, you must not process this
test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the test case number first. Then print n, b and the last digit (in base b) of the
number of calls. There would be a single space in between the two numbers of a line.

Note that the last digit has to be represented in decimal number system.

```

## Sample Output

```text
0 100
1 100
2 100
3 100
10 10
0 0

```
