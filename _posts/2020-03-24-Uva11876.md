title: Uva 11876  N  NOD N
---


## Input

```
Consider an integer sequence N where,

N0 = 1
Ni = Ni1 +NOD(Ni1) for i > 0

Here, NOD(x) = number of divisors of x.
So the first few terms of this sequence are 1 2 4 7 9 12 18 ...
Given two integers A and B, find out the number of integers

in the above sequence that lies within the range [A,B].
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 100000), that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
contains two integers, A followed by B (1  A  B  1000000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the case number first followed by the required result.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
1 18
1 100
3000 4000

```
