title: Uva 12587  Reduce the Maintenance Cost
---


## Input

```

There are n towns (numbered from 1 to n) in a strange city and the maintenance costs of the towns are
not necessarily same. There are bi-directional roads in the city and a road connects two towns. The
merchants use the roads to trade amongst towns. If a road becomes unusable for some reason, it may
affect the trading between some towns.

So, the mayor of the city has planned that every road will be maintained by one of its connecting
towns. That means if a road connects town a and b, then either a or b (not both) will be given the
responsibility to maintain the road.

The cost of maintaining a road is = N  L. Here:
N = The number of town pairs that cannot trade if this road is damaged,

L = the length of the road

If a town is given the responsibility to maintain some roads then the maintenance cost of the town
will be increased by the summation of maintenance costs of the roads itd be maintaining. Now, you are
given the information of the towns, your task is to assign the roads to towns such that the maximum
maintenance cost of a town is as small as possible.

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T (T  30), denoting the number of test cases.
Each case starts with a blank line. Next line contains two integers n (2  n  10000) and m

(0  m  20000), where n denotes the number of towns andm denotes the number of roads respectively.
The next line contains n space separated integers between 1 and 10000 (inclusive), where the i-th integer
denotes the maintenance cost of the i-th town. Each of the next m lines contains three integers u v
w (1  u, v  n, 1  w  10000, u = v), denoting that there is a road between town u and v whose
length is w. There is at most one road between two towns.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and the result.

Note: Dataset is huge, use faster I/O methods.

For case 2, if the road between 1 and 4 goes down the town pairs that will be affected are: (1, 4),
(1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6).
