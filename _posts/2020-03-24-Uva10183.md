title: Uva 10183  How many Fibs
---


## Input

```
Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers:

f1 := 1

f2 := 2

fn := fn1 + fn2 (n  3)

Given two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range [a, b].
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two non-negative integer numbers a
and b. Input is terminated by a = b = 0. Otherwise, a  b  10100. The numbers a and b are given
with no superfluous leading zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers fi with a  fi  b.

```

## Sample Output

```
10 100
1234567890 9876543210
0 0

```
