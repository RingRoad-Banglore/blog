title: Uva 12300  Smallest Regular Polygon
---


## Input

```
Given two different points A and B, your task is to find a regular polygon of n sides, passing through
these two points, so that the polygon area is minimized.
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each case contains 5 integers xA, yA, xB, yB, n (0 
xA, yA, xB, yB  100, 3  n  10000), the coordinates of A and B, and the number of sides of
the regular polygon. The two points A and B are always different. The last test case is followed by a
line with five zeros, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the smallest area of the regular polygon to six decimal places.

```

## Sample Output

```
0 0 1 1 4
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
0 0 0 0 0

```
