## Input

```
At time 0, F frogs are sitting on a straight line. All the positions of the frogs are non-negative integer
numbers. Every second, all the frogs jump. Each of the frogs has its own velocity, i.e., every second
the i-th frog jumps Vi units. Every frog jumps to its right.

The line is divided into N +1 contiguous segment. The left end of the first segment is always 0 and
the right end of the (N + 1)-th segment is 109. The segments are denoted by a sequence of N positive
integers, the right end point of first N segments. Every segment except the first one starts from the
first point after the right endpoint of the last segment.

For example, if N = 1 and the sequence has 1 integer number 10, then there are two segments, one
is from 0 to 10 and another is from 11 to 109, both inclusive.

You are given the initial positions of all the F frogs and a sequence of positive integers describing
the segments. Find the minimum time it will take all the frogs to reach a single segment. A frog is
said to be on a segment if and only if its sitting on some points inside the segment (including the
endpoints). Please note that a frog is not said to be inside a segment when its jumping.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with a single positive integer, 1  T  10, on a single line, denoting the number of test
cases. Each of the following T test cases has the following 5 lines,

1. Blank line. To separate cases.

2. Two non-negative positive integers 1  F  1000, 1  N  100, 000.

3. F non negative integers, where the i-th integer represents the position of the i-th frog.

4. F non negative integers, where the i-th integer represents the velocity of the i-th frog.

5. A sequence of N positive integers describing the segments.
Note that, all the numbers in the input are greater than 0 and less than 109 where a limit is not
specified.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the minimum time it takes all the frogs to reach a single segment. If its impossible
for all the frogs to be on a single segment, print -1. For every case print the output on a single line.
