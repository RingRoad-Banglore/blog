```

Fig: Square in a pentagon.

You are asked to place the largest possible square inside a regular
pentagon (whose internal angles are same and all the sides are
same in length). You are given the information that one vertex of
the square will be coincident with a vertex of the square as shown
in the figure below. You will have to find the length of a side of
the square when a side of the regular pentagon is given.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains
a floating point number F (0  F  100000) which indicates the
length of a side of the pentagon. Input is terminated by end of
file.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output containing a floating point number with ten digits
after the decimal point. This number indicates the largest possible side of a square that fits in the
pentagon. This output will be judged with a special correction program, so dont worry about small
precision errors.
