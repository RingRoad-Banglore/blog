title: Uva 11184  Joyful Ride
---


```
Suppose you want to own a roller coaster. Before you start, you might
be interested in designing the course. The course is circular when seen
from above, with n towers of equal distances on it. The figure below
shows a course with n = 7 (numbers inside circles are heights of towers).

To make the towers look interesting, their heights should be distinct
positive integers not greater than n+1. To let customers enjoy a large
variety of excitement, the height differences between neighboring towers
should be all different. Since there are n height differences, each integer
value between 1 and n must appear exactly once. In the example above,
the height differences are: 8-1=7, 8-2=6, 7-2=5, 7-3=4, 5-3=2, 5-4=1,
4-1=3. You can check that every integer between 1 and 7 appears
exactly once.

Write a program to design the ride.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each case contains a single integer n (2  n  1000), the
number of towers. The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and n numbers if the design is possible, -1 otherwise.

```

## Sample Input

```
7
234
0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 1 4 5 3 7 2 8
Case 2: -1
```
