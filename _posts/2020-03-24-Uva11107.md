title: Uva 11107  Life Forms
---


## Input

```
You may have wondered why most extraterrestrial life forms
resemble humans, differing by superficial traits such as height,
colour, wrinkles, ears, eyebrows and the like. A few bear no hu-
man resemblance; these typically have geometric or amorphous
shapes like cubes, oil slicks or clouds of dust.

The answer is given in the 146th episode of Star Trek - The
Next Generation, titled The Chase. It turns out that in the vast
majority of the quadrants life forms ended up with a large frag-
ment of common DNA.

Given the DNA sequences of several life forms represented as
strings of letters, you are to find the longest substring that is
shared by more than half of them.
```

## Output

```
Standard input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with 1  n  100, the number of life
forms. n lines follow; each contains a string of lower case letters representing the DNA sequence of a
life form. Each DNA sequence contains at least one and not more than 1000 letters.

A line containing 0 follows the last test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the longest string or strings shared by more than half of the life forms. If
there are many, output all of them in alphabetical order. If there is no solution with at least one letter,
output ?. Leave an empty line between test cases.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
abcdefg
bcdefgh
cdefghi
3
xxx
yyy
zzz
0
