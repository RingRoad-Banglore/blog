title: Uva 00287  Text Comparsion
---


```
Write a program that will compare two texts. The two texts are assumed do be different versions of
the same text. Three different things can happen to a text between two versions:

 Text could be deleted

 Text could be inserted

 Text could be changed

Any combination of the three can occur at once. A move, for example will look as a deletion at
one place and an insert at another. You should list all changes that happened from the old to the new
version.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several datasets, each containing two lines with text1 and text2 strings. They
contain the two versions of the text to compare. String text2 should be regarded as the older version,
and string text1 as the newer.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the outputfile contain all deletions, insertions and changes that happended to the
text between the two versions in the following format:

 deletion: Position of the first character deleted, the word deleted and the number of characters
deleted and the text that has been deleted.

 insertion: Position of the first character of the text inserted, the word inserted since the last
version, the number of characters inserted an the text inserted.

 change: Position of the first character changed, the word changed, the number of characters
changed, the original text and what it has been changed to.

The position of the first character always refers to the position in the older version (i.e. the position
within text2). The first character in a file is numbered zero (0). The program should not be case-
sensitive.

Seee the sample below for details. Print a blank line after the output of each test case.

Note: The numbers for position characters and the headings of lines are not included in the input file.
