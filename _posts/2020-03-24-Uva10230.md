title: Uva 10230  Savage Garden
---


## Input

```
Mr. Savage has a huge square-shaped garden named Savage Garden. The Savage Garden is very famous
for its rare plants and amazing beauty. Currently, he is thinking of improving the garden by changing
the orientation of plants into a special way. He wishes to divide the garden into smaller square regions
such that the length of the complete square region is a power of two. Then, he wants to group the
regions into L-shaped regions formed by three smaller squares. Each L-shaped region will have a different
plant from the adjacent L-shaped regions. He feels that the L will represent Love and his loved ones
from all over the world and in the heavens can enjoy its beauty forever.

You have been hired by Mr. Savage to generate a plan for Savage Garden.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several test cases. Each test case specifies three integers, N , X and Y . N , 1  N  10
represents that Savage Garden is of size 2N  2N , after division. X and Y indicate the region where his
house is located. For example, topmost-leftmost region is indicated by X = 1 and Y = 1. Of course,
he doesnt want his house to be planted with saplings. So, make sure you leave his house intact while
deriving the plan. You can assume that the co-ordinates given are always within the square region.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a square matrix showing the Savage Garden. Indicate his house by the
character *. All other regions should be indicated by alphabets a-z. Character used to represent one
Lshaped region should be different from the ones used to represent its neighboring Lshaped regions.
Assume that each small square region has 8 neighbors. If there are many solutions, you may output
any of them. You may assume that there is at least one solution for the given test cases. Output a
blank line after each test case.

```

## Sample Output

```
2 3 4
