title: Uva 11960  Divisor Game
---


## Input

```
Steve is playing a game with numbers. He picks up a random positive number N and finds the largest
positive number not bigger than N that has the most divisors. As N becomes larger its more and more
difficult for Steve to avoid mistakes when counting the divisors and he asks you to write a program.
You argue that it is a very easy task to just find the divisors and suggest that you could solve the
original task of Steve as well.
```

## Output

```
You are given a number of tests T (T  50000). Each test on a single line specifies a number N
(1  N  106).

```

## Sample Input
