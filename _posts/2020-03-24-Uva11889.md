title: Uva 11889  Benefit
---


```
Recently Yaghoub is playing a new trick to sell some more. When somebody gives him A Tomans, he
who never has appropriate changes, asks for B Tomans such that lowest common multiple of A and B
equals to C and he will pay back a round bill. Or otherwise take some snack instead of the remaining of
his money. He believes that finding such a number is hard enough that dissuades students from paying
that.

You should write a program that help poor students giving the appropriate amount of money to
Yaghoub. Of course if there are several answers you go for students benefit which is the lowest of them.
