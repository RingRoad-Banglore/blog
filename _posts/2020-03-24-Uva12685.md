title: Uva 12685  Binary Tree
---


```

Binary Tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, usually they are
distinguished as left and right child. And the node having the children are called parent of those
children.

An instruction string is a string consisting of the letters L, R and U. L stands for Left, R for Right
and U for Up. Meaning of these will be clear shortly.

One day I have drawn an infinitely large Binary Tree. In this tree each node has exactly two
children (left child and right child) and each of them has a parent. For this problem, we will consider
the parent of the root is root itself. I put a pen in the root and follow the instruction string S.
That is, we look at the first character if it says L we go to left child, if it says R we go to right child
and if it says U then to the parent. If we receive a U instruction at root we just end up at root since we
assumed parent of the root is root itself.

Now we have another instruction string T . Starting from the node where we are after following the
instruction string S, we will follow the instruction string T . But this time, if we wish we may skip any
instruction in the string T (possibly discarding all of them). You have to tell me how many different
nodes I can end up after following instruction string T (skipping as many instructions as I wish).

For example:
Suppose: S = L and T = LU. Our answer is 3. Following S we will end up at the left child of the

root. Now, when we follow T , there may be 4 cases:

i Skipping all letters: we will be at the same node where we are.

ii Skipping L and following U: we will be at the root.

iii Following L and skipping U: we will be at the left child of current node.

iv Following both L and U: we will be at the same node as in case i.

Since 3 different nodes we can end up after following T, the answer is 3.

## Input

```
First line of the test file contains an integer N ( 20) denoting number of test cases. Hence follow N
test cases. Each test case consists of two non empty strings. First line will contain instruction string S
and the second line will contain the instruction string T . You may assume that there will not be any
letter other than L, R or U in these strings. Length of the strings will not be greater than 100000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case print the case number followed by the number of nodes we can end up finally. Since
the answer may be large, you have to give the answer modulo 21092013.
