```
Sort a sequence of integers in non-decreasing order by repeating a single operation:

Delete any of one of the numbers in the sequence and add it to an existing number.
For example, to sort (3,2,2), simply take one of the 2s and add to other 2 to get (3,4) in a single

operation.
```

## Input

```
A number of of inputs ( 150), each starting with n on a line, followed by a line with n numbers ai
(1  n  5000, 1  ai  100000).

```

## Output

```
For each input, output the minimum number of operations required to sort the sequence.

```

## Sample Input

```
