## Input

```text
Gurin and Malon are a couple of penguins living in Binary Land, a marvelous country. They are
trapped in a mystical maze, described as a grid with cells that are either free spaces or walls. Exactly
one of the free spaces is designated as the love cell, having a nice heart inside a cage. Gurin and Malon
are initially located at two free spaces inside the maze.

The maze is surrounded by walls, so no penguin can move outside it because, as everyone knows,
penguins cannot move through walls.

Both penguins can move freely through the free spaces, until they meet at the love cell, where they
can fall in love together. At any given time, a penguin can move from its current cell to an adjacent
cell in one of four possible directions: north, south, east and west.

However, Gurin and Malon were cursed by an evil witch! If a penguin goes north or south, then the
other must automatically go in the same direction; and, if a penguin goes east or west, then the other
must automatically go in the opposite direction. As it was mentioned before, no penguin can move
through a wall and additionally, both penguins can be in the same cell at any given time.

In detail, the curse works as follows:

 If a penguin has a free cell to the north and it moves one step to the north, then the other penguin
must move one step to the north (at the same time). However, if the other penguin had a wall to
the north, it must stay in its current cell.

 If a penguin has a free cell to the south and it moves one step to the south, then the other penguin
must move one step to the south (at the same time). However, if the other penguin had a wall to
the south, it must stay in its current cell.

 If a penguin has a free cell to the west and it moves one step to the west, then the other penguin
must move one step to the east (at the same time). However, if the other penguin had a wall to
the east, it must stay in its current cell.

 If a penguin has a free cell to the east and it moves one step to the east, then the other penguin
must move one step to the west (at the same time). However, if the other penguin had a wall to
the west, it must stay in its current cell.

Each cursed move of both penguins takes exactly one unit of time. Given a maze, the coordinates
of the love cell, and the initial coordinates of Gurin and Malon, what is the minimum amount of time
in which both penguins can fall in love together?

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two blank-separated integers
R and C (1  R  40, 1  C  40) indicating, respectively, the number of rows and columns of the
maze (without the surrounding walls). The second line contains six blank-separated integers rL, cL, rG,
cG, rM , and cM (1  rL, rG, rM  R, and 1  cL, cG, cM  C) indicating the coordinates (rL, cL) of the
love cell, the initial coordinates (rG, cG) of Gurin, and the initial coordinates (rM , cM ) of Malon. Each
of the next R lines contains C characters . or #, where . represents a free space and # represents
a wall. You may assume that the coordinates (rL, cL), (rG, cG) and (rM , cM ) correspond to free spaces,
and that the given maze is surrounded by walls.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a single line with the minimum amount of time in which both penguins can
meet at the love cell or with the text NO LOVE if it is impossible for them to meet at the love cell.
