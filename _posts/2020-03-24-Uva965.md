title: Uva 00965  Police Road Blocks
---


```

Consider that a group of criminals was able to rob a bank and got away with a considerable amount
of money. However, they were reckless and the security cameras were able to film them. Hence, the
police was able to identify everybody in the group.

Suppose that the police has a map defined by (L,E), where L denotes the set of locations (with
|L|  106) and E denotes the set of roads connecting those locations (with |L|  1  |E|  106). The
map is connected, i.e., for all pairs of locations (u, v) there is always a connecting path in the map.

Let f : LL  N be a function that defines for every road (u, v)  E how many police officers are
necessary to make a police road block at road (u, v). Given a set of roads Ec, such that Ec  E, the
value of f(Ec) denotes the total number of police officers necessary to make road blocks in every road
(u, v)  Ec.

Since the police know the criminals, they were able to identify a set S (with S  L) of highly
suspicious places where the criminals are probably hiding. The purpose of the criminals is to be able
to get into a border location in order to get out of the country. The set F defines the set of border
locations such that F  L and S  F =  Therefore, the police needs to make road blocks in a set of
roads Ec with Ec  E in order to ensure that the criminals will not be able to move from the suspected
locations to the border without using one of the roads with police road blocks.

Your program must determine which is the minimum number of police officers necessary to control
a set of roads Ec such that the criminals will not be able to run from the suspected locations to the
border.

## Input

```
The input is as follows:

 One line with the number of locations N and the number of roads M in the map.

 A list of M lines where in each line there are three integers. The first two are two locations u
and v connected in the map and the third is the number f(u, v) of police officers necessary to
establish the police road block in that road.

 One line with a number S of suspected locations

 One line with S integers representing the suspected locations

 One line with a number F of border locations

 One line with F integers representing the border locations

```

## Output

```
The output must be the minimum number of police officers necessary to establish road blocks in a set
of roads Ec such that the criminals can not move from the suspected locations to the border without
going through a road with a police road block.
