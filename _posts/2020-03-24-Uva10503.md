title: Uva 10503  The dominoes solitaire
---


## Input

```text
A man used to play dominoes with some friends in a small town. Some families have left the town and
at present the only residents in the town are the man and his wife. This man would like to continue
playing dominoes, but his wife does not like plaing. He has invented a game to play alone. Two pieces
are picked out and are put at the two extremes of a row with a number (n) of spaces. After that, other
pieces (m) are picked out to fill the spaces. The number of pieces is greater than or equal to the number
of spaces (m  n), and the number of pieces is less than or equal to 14 (m  14). The spaces are filled
by putting one piece in each space, accoding to the rules of dominoes: the number of adjacent dots on
two different dominoes must coincide. Pieces with repeated values are placed in the same way as the
other pieces, and not at right angels.

The problem consists in the design of a program which, given a number of spaces (n), a number
of pieces (m), the two initial pieces (i1, i2) and (d1, d2), and the m pieces (p1, q1), (p2, q2), , (pm, qm),
decides if it is possible to fill the n spaces between the two initial pieces using the m pieces and with
the rules of dominoes. For example, with n = 3, m = 4, initial pieces (0,1) and (3,4), and pieces (2,1),
(5,6), (2,2) and (3,2), the answer is YES, because there is a solution: (0,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,4).
With n = 2, m = 4, pieces in the extremes (0,1) and (3,4), and (1,4), (4,4), (3,2) and (5,6), the answer
is NO.

## Output

```text
The input will consist of a series of problems, with each problem described in a series of lines: in the
first line the number of spaces (n) is indicated, in the second line the number of pieces (m) used to fill
the spaces, in the next line the piece to be placed on the left, with the two values in the piece separated
by a space and in the same way that the numbers appear in the row, in the following lines the piece to
be placed on the right, with the two values in the piece separated by a space and in the same way that
the numbers appear in the row, and the other m pieces appear in consecutive lines, one in each line,
with the two values separated by a space. Different problems appear in the input successively without
separation, and the input finishes when 0 appears as the number of spaces.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each problem in the input a line is written, with YES if the problem has a solution, and NO if it
has no solution.
