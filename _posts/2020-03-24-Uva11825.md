title: Uva 11825  Hackers Crackdown
---


```
Miracle Corporations has a number of system services running in a distributed computer system which
is a prime target for hackers. The system is basically a set of N computer nodes with each of them
running a set of N services. Note that, the set of services running on every node is same everywhere in
the network. A hacker can destroy a service by running a specialized exploit for that service in all the
nodes.

One day, a smart hacker collects necessary exploits for all these N services and launches an attack
on the system. He finds a security hole that gives him just enough time to run a single exploit in each
computer. These exploits have the characteristic that, its successfully infects the computer where it
was originally run and all the neighbor computers of that node.

Given a network description, find the maximum number of services that the hacker can damage.
```

## Input

```
There will be multiple test cases in the input file. A test case begins with an integer N (1  N  16),
the number of nodes in the network. The nodes are denoted by 0 to N  1. Each of the following N
lines describes the neighbors of a node. Line i (0  i < N) represents the description of node i. The
description for node i starts with an integer m (Number of neighbors for node i), followed by m integers
in the range of 0 to N  1, each denoting a neighboring node of node i.

The end of input will be denoted by a case with N = 0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line in the format, Case X: Y , where X is the case number & Y is the
maximum possible number of services that can be damaged.

```

## Sample Input
