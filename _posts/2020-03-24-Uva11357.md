title: Uva 11357  Ensuring Truth
---


## Input

```text
In this problem we will consider Boolean formulas written according to the following BNF grammar:

<formula> ::= <clause> | <formula> "|" <clause>
<clause> ::= "(" <conjunction-of-literals> ")"
<conjunction-of-literals> ::= <literal> | <conjunction-of-literals> "&" <literal>
<literal> ::= <variable> | "~" <variable>
<variable> ::= "a" | "b" | "c" | ... | "z"

Each formula can contain up to 26 different Boolean variables, which are denoted by lowercase En-
glish letters. We use the ampersand sign (&) to denote conjunction, vertical bar (|) for disjunction,
and tilde (~) for inversion. The truth tables of these operators are shown below for your reference.

x y x & y
false false false
false true false
true false false
true true true

x y x | y
false false false
false true true
true false true
true true true

x x
false true
true false

A formula is called satisfiable if it is possible to assign values to its variables in such a way as to
make the formula evaluate to true.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains an integer T (1  T  5000). Each of the next T lines contains
a Boolean formula. You can assume that the formulas will strictly follow the grammar specified above,
and will not be longer than 250 characters.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each formula, you should determine whether it is satisfiable, and output a line YES if yes, it is,
and NO otherwise.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
(a&b&c)|(a&b)|(a)
(x&~x)

```
