title: Uva 01236  Disjoint Paths
---


## Input

```

Path in a graph is defined to be disjoint if there is no common edge and vertex that belongs to more
than one path. Given a connected graph with N nodes and N  1 weighted edges, we are interested in
finding a set of up to K paths in the graph which are disjoint to each other. The set of paths should
be chosen so that the sum of all weight of edges of the paths is the maximum possible.

The example above shows two configurations of disjoint paths in the same graph. When the limit
of paths to be drawn (K) is one (shown on the left), the maximum sum of all the weight of its edges
is 13 (5+2+6). However, when we are allowed to draw up to 2 disjoint paths, we can draw two paths
whose sum of edge weights evaluates to 15 (shown on the right).
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a line containing an integer T , the number of test cases follow. Each case begins
with two non-negative integers N and K (K  N  60). The next N  1 following lines each will
contains three integers: A, B and D (1  A,B  N ; and |D|  10000) which means that there is an
undirected edge from node A to node B with weight D.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print in a single line the maximum possible sum of weight of up to K disjoint paths in
the given graph.
