title: Uva 11630  Cyclic antimonotonic permutations
---


```
A permutation is a sequence of integers which contains each integer from 1 to n exactly once. In this
problem we are looking for permutations with special properties:

1. Antimonotonic: for each consecutive 3 values pi1, pi, pi+1 (1 < i < n), pi should either be the
smallest or the biggest of the three values.

2. Cyclic: The permutation should consist of only one cycle, that is, when we use pi as a pointer
from i to pi, it should be possible to start at position 1 and follow the pointers and reach all n
positions before returning to position 1.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing an integer n,
(3  n  106), the number of integers in the permutation. Input is terminated by n = 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case print a permutation of the integers 1 to n which is both antimonotonic and cyclic. In
case there are multiple solutions, you may print any one. Separate all integers by whitespace characters.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
5
10
0

```

## Sample Output

```
3 1 2
4 5 2 3 1
6 10 2 9 3 5 4 7 1 8
```
