title: Uva 00478  Points in Figures Rectangles Circles and Triangles
---


## Input

```
Given a list of figures (rectangles, circles, and triangles) and a list of points in the x-y plane, determine
for each point which figures (if any) contain the point.
```

## Output

```
There will be n( 10) figures descriptions, one per line. The first character will designate the type of
figure (r, c, t for rectangle, circle, or triangle, respectively). This character will be followed by
values which describe that figure.

 For a rectangle, there will be four real values designating the x-y coordinates of the upper left
and lower right corners.

 For a circle, there will be three real values, designating the x-y coordinates of the center and the
radius.

 For a triangle, there will be six real values designating the x-y coordinates of the vertices.

The end of the list will be signalled by a line containing an asterisk in column one.

The remaining lines will contain the x-y coordinates, one per line, of the points to be tested. The
end of this list will be indicated by a point with coordinates 9999.9 9999.9; these values should not be
included in the output.

Points coinciding with a figure border are not considered inside.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each point to be tested, write a message of the form:

Point i is contained in figure j

for each figure that contains that point. If the point is not contained in any figure, write a message of
the form:

Point i is not contained in any figure

Points and figures should be numbered in
the order in which they appear in the input.

Note: See the picture on the right for a dia-
gram of these figures and data points.
