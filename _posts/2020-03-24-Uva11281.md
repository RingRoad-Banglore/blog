title: Uva 11281  Triangular Pegs in Round Holes
---


## Input

```text
Ever since we were small children, we have
learned that square pegs do not fit into round
holes. This is so much the truth that it has be-
come a figure of speech in the English language.
However, very little is ever said about triangu-
lar pegs. Have you ever wondered whether or
not they would fit into round holes?

In this problem, you are given a description
of a set of triangular pegs and round holes. You are to determine whether or not these triangular pegs
would fit through the round holes.

Each peg is a perfect triangular prism where the lengths of the three sides of the triangular face are
given. Each hole is a perfect circle with its diameter given. All pegs are longer than the diameter of
the largest hole.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains a number M (1  M  100), the number of holes. The next
line contains a sequence of M positive real numbers that describe the diameters of the holes. The first
such number is the diameter of hole 1, the second of hole 2, and so on.

A single number N (1  N  26), the number of pegs, appears on the next line. N lines of input,
each containing three real numbers describing the lengths of the sides of a triangular face, follow. The
pegs are named A through Z, so that first such line describes peg A, the second peg B, and so on.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each triangular peg, write one line indicating the holes that the peg will fit into, in the increasing
numerical order given. Follow the format shown in the sample output. If a peg will not fit into any of
the holes, output a line containing the text Peg  will not fit into any holes, where  is the
name of the peg.

```
