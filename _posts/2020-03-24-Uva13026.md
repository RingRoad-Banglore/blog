## Input

```text
Jalil is a five year old wonder boy. He has a very strange memory power. He can memorize any number
in his brain with at most one digit error. If you ask him to tell first 1000 digits of PI (3.141592...),
he will go through it without any hesitation. But he could have made a mistake in at most one digit,
whether you ask him to tell first 100 digits or 5 digits. Suppose you asked him to tell first 4 digits of
PI after decimal place. Probable answer from him could be 1415, 1416, 0415, 1475 etc. but not 0516,
1517 etc.

Due to ACM ICPC Preliminary contest, today is a school holiday for Jalil but not for his mommy.
He is feeling bored and thought about calling mommy to come home early. But his mommy has a new
mobile phone with new number. Though his mommy told him the number but he is afraid he might
have forgotten one of the digits of the mobile number. He took his dads mobile and searched for his
mommys number in the contact list, but could not succeed. Jalil is cent percent sure that one of the
numbers in the contact list of his dads mobile is his mommys number. So he took a backup of his dads
contact list in his computer and started matching the number he can remember with all the numbers
in the contact list.

As Jalil know that he might have mistaken at most one digit in his mommys mobile number, he
is preparing a list of mobile numbers from his dads contact list such that each of the numbers is only
at most one digit different from the number he remembers. As Jalil does not know programming, help
him to prepare the list.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contain a positive integer T (T  10), the number of test cases. First line of
each test case contains a positive integer number N ( 1000), number of mobile number in the dads
contact list. Each of the next N lines will contain a mobile number from dads contact list. Next line
will contain mommys phone number which Jalil can recall. A mobile number is a non-empty string of
numeric characters (0 to 9, leading zero allowed) of length at most 11. Every mobile number (contact
list and mommys number) given in a single test case will be of same length. Note that, 0123 and
00123 are different mobile numbers.

## Sample Input
