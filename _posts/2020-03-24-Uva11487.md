## Input

```

Winter is approaching! The weather is getting colder and days are becoming shorter. The animals take
different measures to adjust themselves during this season.

 Some of them migrate. This means they travel to other places where the weather is warmer.

 Few animals remain and stay active in the winter.

 Some animals hibernate for all of the winter. This is a very deep sleep. The animals body
temperature drops, and its heartbeat and breathing slow down. In the fall, these animals get
ready for winter by eating extra food and storing it as body fat.

For this problem, we are interested in the 3-rd example and we will be focusing on Yogi Bear.

Yogi Bear is in the middle of some forest. The forest can be modeled as a square grid of size N N .
Each cell of the grid consists of one of the following.

. an empty space

# an obstacle

[A-Z] an English alphabet

There will be at least 1 alphabet and all the letters in the grid will be distinct. If there are n letters,
then it will be from the first n alphabets. Suppose n = 3, that means there will be exactly 1 A, 1 B
and 1 C.

The letters actually represent foods lying on the ground. Yogi starts from position A and sets off
with a basket in the hope of collecting all other foods. Yogi can move to a cell if it shares an edge with
the current one. For some superstitious reason, Yogi decides to collect all the foods in order. That is,
he first collects A, then B, then C and so on until he reaches the food with the highest alphabet value.
Another philosophy he follows is that if he lands on a particular food he must collect it.

Help Yogi to collect all the foods in minimum number of moves so that he can have a long sleep in
the winter. You are also required to find the total number of shortest paths he can take that meets the
above constraints.
```

## Output

```
There will be several cases in the input file. Each case starts with, N (N  10), the size of the grid.
Each of the next N lines contains N characters each. Input ends with a value of 0 for N .

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the case number first. If its impossible to collect all the foods, output Impossible.
Otherwise, print the shortest distance followed by the total number of distinct paths. Since the total
number of shortest paths can be very big, output the result modulo 20437.
