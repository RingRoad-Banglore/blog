## Input

```

Indonesian children like to play with rubber bands, partly because they are very widely available, and
partly because a lot of villagers could not afford modern, more expensive toys for their kids.

The original shape of the rubber band is a simple circle like in Figure 1. Figure 2 and 3 are some
origami kids can make with rubber bands.

There are only two kinds of basic transformations of a rubber band:

1. Self-loop

2. Passing

The two transformations, when repeated multiple times on different parts of the rubber band, can
yield any of the valid origami.

Now your task is to detect whether a given origami is possible or impossible to be formed from the
original rubber band shape.

The description of the origami is as follows. Suppose the rubber band
has length L, and points in the rubber band is marked 0, 1, 2, . . . , L 1,
as illustrated on the right. Then the origami can be described with exactly
P pairs (Ai, Bi) of distinct numbers, such that when the origami is placed
in a flat plane and looked at from the top of the plane, position Ai in the
rubber band overlaps and occludes (is at the front of) position Bi.

Given the description of the overlappings of the flattened origami as
seen from the top, determine whether the origami position is reachable
from the original shape of the rubber band.

## Output

```
The first line of input contains an integer T (T  100) denoting the number of cases. The first line
of each case contains two integers, L (1  L  1, 000, 000) and P (1  P  5, 000) as defined by the
problem statement. The next P lines each contains Ai and Bi (0  Ai, Bi < L). A blank line follows
the last line in each case. The input is guaranteed to satisfy these conditions:

 A position in an origami is mentioned in at most one pair with some other position, describing a
unique overlap.

 The origami represented by the input is planar, that is, the overlappings result from the origami
being flattened on a plane.

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output Case #X: Y , where X is case number starts from 1 and Y is either a YES or
a NO (without quotes). A YES indicates that the origami is possible to be formed from the original
shape of the rubber band. A NO indicates otherwise.

The following 3 figures correspond to sample input.
