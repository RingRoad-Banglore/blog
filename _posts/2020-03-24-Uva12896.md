title: Uva 12896  Mobile SMS
---


```
Ali is known as very much stingy. He bought an old second-hand
mobile phone. He usually uses the mobile phone to receive phone
calls from others and rarely makes a phone call. Suddenly, he ob-
serves that sending a mobile SMS is much cheaper than making
a phone call. So he always sends a mobile SMS instead of making
a phone call. Currently, his mobile phone display has got a prob-
lem that it shows nothing on the screen. It is difficult for him to
write a mobile SMS. But he knows the number arrangement of
his mobile keypad. Now he asks your help to find out the text he
has keyed in while writing the SMS. He will let you which key he
has pressed and how many times. The keypad arrangement of his
mobile is given in the following picture; _ represents the space.

of the message. Each of the next two lines contains L positive
integers. First line contains 0  Ni  9, 1  i  L and second line contains 1  Pi  4, 1  i  L. Ni
are the keypad numbers which he types and Pi represents how many times he presses the Ni key.
