## Input

```text
Jolly and Emily are two bees studying in Computer Science. Unlike other bees they are fond of playing
two-player games. They used to play Tic-tac-toe, Chess etc. But now since they are in CS they invented
a new game that definitely requires some knowledge of computer science.

Initially they draw a random rooted tree (a connected graph with no cycles) in a paper which
consists of n nodes, where the nodes are numbered from 0 to n 1 and 0 is the root, and the edges are
weighted. Initially all the edges are unmarked. And an edge weigh w, has w identical units.

1. Jolly has a green marker and Emily has a red marker. Emily starts the game first and they
alternate turns.

2. In each turn, a player can color one unit of an edge of the tree if that edge has some (at least
one) uncolored units and the edge can be traversed from the root using only free edges. An edge
is said to be free if the edge is not fully colored (may be uncolored or partially colored).

3. If its Emilys turn, she finds such an edge and colors one unit of it using the red marker.

4. If its Jollys turn, he finds such an edge and colors one unit of it with the green marker.

5. The player, who cant find any edges to color, loses the game.

For example, Fig 1 shows the initial tree they have drawn. The tree contains four nodes and the
weights of the edge (0, 1), (1, 2) and (0, 3) are 1, 1 and 2 respectively. Emilys starts the game. She
can color any edge she wants; she colors one unit of edge (0 1) with her red marker (Fig 2). Since the
weight of edge (0 1) is 1 so, this edge is fully colored.

Fig 1 Fig 2 Fig 3 Fig 4

Now its Jollys turn. He can only color one unit of edge (0 3). He cant color edge (1 2) since if
he wants to traverse it from the root (0), he needs to use (0, 1) which is fully colored already. So, he
colors one unit of edge (0 3) with his green marker (Fig 3). And now Emily has only one option and
she colors the other unit of (0 3) with the red marker (Fig 4). So, both units of edge (0 3) are colored.
Now its Jollys turn but he has no move left. Thus Emily wins. But if Emily would have colored edge
(1 2) instead of edge (0 1), then Jolly would win. So, for this tree Emily will surely win if both of them
play optimally.

Now you are given the tree drawn by them. You have to determine the winner if they both play
optimally.

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 500), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing an integer n (2  n  1000). Each of the next n  1 lines
contains three integers u v w (0  u, v < n, u = v, 1  w  109) denoting that there is an edge between
u and v and their weight is w. You can assume that the given tree is valid.

Note: Dataset is huge, use faster I/O methods.
