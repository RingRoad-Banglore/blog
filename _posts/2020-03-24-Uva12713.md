title: Uva 12713  Pearl Chains
---


## Input

```

You have pearl of 3 types.

 Type 1 pearl can be of color from 1 to X.

 Type 2 pearl can be of color from X + 1 to X + Y

 Type 3 pearl can be of color from X + Y + 1 to X + Y + Z.

You have unlimited supply of pearls of each type and each color. You want to build some pearl
chain. But you have 2 more additional constraints.

 The total number of Type 1 and Type 3 pearls will be exactly A.

 The total number of Type 2 and Type 3 pearls will be exactly B.

Given A, B, X, Y and Z calculate how many different pearl chains are possible. 2 chains are
different if they have different length or there is a position in which they have different colored pearl.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains T (1  T  100) the number of test cases. Each test case contains 5
integers A, B, X, Y and Z. All of these 5 integers are between 1 and 1017 inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output an integer denoting the number of possible pearl chains. Since the result is
too huge output the result modulo 1000003.

```

## Sample Output

```
5

1 1 1 1 1

2 3 1 1 1

1 1 1 2 1

10 10 10 10 10

100 100 100 100 100
