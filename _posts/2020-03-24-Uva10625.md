title: Uva 10625  GNU  GNUsNotUnix
---


```
Let us define GNU, the recursive acronym for GNUs Not
Unix with the following recursive rules:

1. G > GNUs

2. N > Not

3. U > Unix

In each step we apply all the rules simultaneously. If a
character in a string does not have a rule associated with
it (there will be at most one rule per character), it remains
in the string.

For example if we start with GNU, we get:

Step String
0 GNU
1 GNUsNotUnix
2 GNUsNotUnixsNototUnixnix
3 GNUsNotUnixsNototUnixnixsNotototUnixnixnix
4 GNUsNotUnixsNototUnixnixsNotototUnixnixnixsNototototUnixnixnixnix
 

As you can see, the strings are growing larger in every steps. And in certain cases the growth can be
quite fast. Fear not, for were not interested in the entire string. We just want to know the frequency
of a particular character after a finite number of steps.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input starts with an integer, T (1  T  10), the number of test cases. Then T
test cases will follow. The first line of each test case will give you R, (1  R  10) the number of
rules. In each of the next R lines there will be one rule. The rules are written in the following format:
x->S (without the quotes). Here x is a single character and S is a sequence of characters. You can
assume that the ASCII value of the characters lie in the range 33 to 126, that S will contain no more
than 100 characters. You can also assume that the symbols - and > wont appear in S. The rules
can be immediately recursive, recursive in a cycle or not recursive at all. After the rules, youll find an
integer Q (1  Q  10), the number of queries to follow. Each of the Q queries will be presented in
the format initial_string x n in a single line, where initial_string is the string that you have in
step 0 (with length between 1 and 100), x is the character whose frequency you should count, and n
(1  n  10000) is the number of times the rules should be applied. All characters in the initial string
will have ASCII values in the range 33 to 126.

```

## Output

```
For each query, print the number of occurances of the particular character in the result string after
applying the rules n times, starting with the initial string. The output will always fit in a 64-bit
unsigned integer.
