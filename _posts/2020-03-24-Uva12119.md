title: Uva 12119  The Bells are Ringing

## Input

```
Perhaps you all have heard the mythical story
about Tower of Hanoi (The details of this story
is not required to solve this problem): There is
a tower of Hanoi with 64 disks and three pegs
and the preists make one move everyday and
the earth will be destroyed when all the pegs
have been moved from one peg to the other fol-
lowing the rules of Tower of Hanoi. In this
problem we deal with a similar story  The
story of an ancient temple. The ancient temple
has three incredibly large bells. At the begin-
ning of time the three bells rang together. Then
the three bells never rang together and when
they will ring together again the earth will be
destroyed. The three bells have cycle length of
t1, t2 and t3 (Here t1 < t2 < t3 and all are expressed in miliseconds). By this I mean that the first
bell rings at every t1 seconds from the beginning, the second bell rings at every t2 second from the
beginning and the third bell rings at every t3 second from the beginning. Also note that the difference
of the values of t1, t2 and t3 is not that much different so that ordinary people think many time that
they are ringing together.

Given the time difference between destruction of earth and beginning of time you will have to find
the values of t1, t2 and t3.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 600 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer which denotes (in
millisecond) the time difference between the beginning of time and the time of the bells ringing together.
Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. All the input numbers will fit in a 64 bit signed
integer.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce two lines or more of output. The first line contains the serial of output.
Each of the next lines contains three integers which denote the values of t1, t2 and t3 respectively. The
value of t1, t2 and t3 is such that t1 < t2 < t3 and 0 < t1, t2, t3  1000000 and |t1  t3|  25. If you
cannot find values of t1, t2, t3 with such constraints then print the line Such bells dont exist instead.
In case there is more than one solution sort the output in ascending order of the value of t1, then (in
case of a tie) in the ascending order of the value of t2 and then (still a tie) in ascending order of the
value t3. Print a blank line after the output for each test case. Look at the output for sample input for
details.
