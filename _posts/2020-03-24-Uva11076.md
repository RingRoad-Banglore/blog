```
Summation of sequence of integers is always a common problem in Computer Science. Rather than com-
puting blindly, some intelligent techniques make the task simpler. Here you have to find the summation
of a sequence of integers. The sequence is an interesting one and it is the all possible permutations of a
given set of digits. For example, if the digits are <1 2 3>, then six possible permutations are <123>,
<132>, <213>, <231>, <312>, <321> and the sum of them is 1332.
```

## Input

```
Each input set will start with a positive integer N (1  N  12). The next line will contain N decimal
digits. Input will be terminated by N = 0. There will be at most 20000 test set.

```

## Output

```
For each test set, there should be a one line output containing the summation. The value will fit in
64-bit unsigned integer.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
1 2 3
3
1 1 2
0

```

## Sample Output

```
1332
444
```
