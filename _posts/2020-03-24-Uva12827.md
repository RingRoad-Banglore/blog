title: Uva 12827  Just another pachinkolike machine
---


```

Like pachinko? Here is another one. Its not exactly a traditional pachinko, but its also a let-the-ball-
hit-things game.

In the machine, there are n non-overlapping non-vertical bars, shown below. Here non-overlapping
means for every pair of bars, the two segments do not intersect, do not have common end-point, and
do not partially overlap (they may overlap when projected to x-axis, though).

At the i-th step, the ball will be transferred to (xi, yi), then start to fall vertically, hopefully itll
hit a bar and earn some scores. A ball who hit the i-th bar will earn a score of si. If the ball directly
drops on the floor (with y = 0), it will not score.

The most interesting part of the machine is: if the i-th bar is hit during this step, it will
disappear at that moment and re-appear after di steps. For example, if a bar with di = 3 is hit
in the 5-th step, then itll be missing during step 6 and 7, and will re-appear in step 8.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 5 test cases. Each test case begins with one integer n (1  n  105), the
number of bars. Each of the next lines contains 6 integers x1, y1, x2, y2, s, d (0  x1 < x2  109,
1  y1, y2  200000, 1  s  1000, 1  d  5), describing one bar. No two bars can have any common
point (i.e. no intersection, cant touch each other etc).

The next line contains b (1  b  105), the number of balls. In the next b lines, the i-th line
describes the ball appear in the i-th step. Each line contains two integers (x, y), that means the ball
will appear at (xi, yi) = (x

 XOR a, y XOR a), where a is the current score before the ball falls (which
will be zero at the beginning of each test case). It is guaranteed that xi and yi are non-negative integers
and will not be precisely on a bar.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number in the first line and the scores after each step. There should
be one empty line after each test case.

Explanation for Sample 1

Step 1: ball (3,5) will hit the first bar, score = 1

Step 2: ball (3,5) will hit the second bar, score = 9

Step 3 (bar 2 appear again): ball (1,5) will hit the ground, score = 0

Step 4: ball (3,3) will hit the second bar, score = 9

Step 5 (bar 1&2 appear again): ball (3,9) will hit the first bar again, score = 1
