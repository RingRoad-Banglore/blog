title: Uva 01718  Tile Cutting

## Input

```
Youssef is a Moroccan tile installer who specializes in mosaics like the
one shown on the right. He has rectangular tiles of many dimensions
at his disposal, and the dimensions of all his tiles are integer numbers
of centimeters. When Youssef needs parallelogram-shaped tiles, he cuts
them from his supply on hand. To make this work easier, he invented a
tile cutting machine that superimposes a centimeter grid on the cutting
surface to guide the cuts on the tiles. Due to machine limitations,
aesthetic sensibilities, and Youssefs dislike of wasted tiles, the following
rules determine the possible cuts.

1. The rectangular tile to be cut must be positioned in the bottom left corner of the cutting surface
and the edges must be aligned with the grid lines.

2. The cutting blade can cut along any line connecting two different grid points on the tile boundary
as long as the points are on adjacent boundary edges.

3. The four corners of the resulting parallelogram tile must lie on the four sides of the original
rectangular tile.

4. No edge of the parallelogram tile can lie along an edge of the rectangular tile.

Figure J.1 shows the eight different ways in which a parallelogram tile of area 4 square centimeters
can be cut out of a rectangular tile, subject to these restrictions.

Youssef needs to cut tiles of every area between alo and ahi. Now he wonders, for which area a in
this range can he cut the maximum number of different tiles?

## Output

```
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer n (1  n  500),
the number of test cases. The next n lines each contain two integers alo, ahi (1  alo  ahi  500000),
the range of areas of the tiles.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case alo, ahi, display the value a between alo and ahi such that the number of possible
ways to cut a parallelogram of area a is maximized as well as the number of different ways w in which
such a parallelogram can be cut. If there are multiple possible values of a display the smallest one.
