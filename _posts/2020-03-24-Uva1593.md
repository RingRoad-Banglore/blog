title: Uva 01593  Alignment of Code
---


## Input

```

You are working in a team that writes Incredibly Customizable Programming Codewriter (ICPC) which
is basically a text editor with bells and whistles. You are working on a module that takes a piece of
code containing some definitions or other tabular information and aligns each column on a fixed vertical
position, while keeping the resulting code as short as possible, making sure that only whitespaces that
are absolutely required stay in the code. So, that the first words on each line are printed at position
p1 = 1; the second words on each line are printed at the minimal possible position p2, such that all first
words end at or before position p2 2; the third words on each line are printed at the minimal possible
position p3, such that all second words end at or before position p3  2, etc.

For the purpose of this problem, the code consists of multiple lines. Each line consists of one or
more words separated by spaces. Each word can contain uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, all
ASCII punctuation marks, separators, and other non-whitespace ASCII characters (ASCII codes 33 to
126 inclusive). Whitespace consists of space characters (ASCII code 32).
```

## Output

```
The input file contains one or more lines of the code up to the end of file. All lines (including the last
one) are terminated by a standard end-of-line sequence in the file. Each line contains at least one word,
each word is 1 to 80 characters long (inclusive). Words are separated by one or more spaces. Lines of
the code can have both leading and trailing spaces. Each line in the input file is at most 180 characters
long. There are at most 1000 lines in the input file.

```

## Sample Input

```
Write to the output file the reformatted, aligned code that consists of the same number of lines, with
the same words in the same order, without trailing and leading spaces, separated by one or more spaces
such that i-th word on each line starts at the same position pi.

Note for the Sample:
The  character in the example below denotes a space character in the actual files (ASCII code

32).

```

## Sample Output

```
start:integer;//beginshere

stop:integer;//endshere

s:string;

c:char;//temp

```
