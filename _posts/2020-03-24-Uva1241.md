title: Uva 01241  Jollybee Tournament
---


## Input

```

In Jollybee Chess Championship 2008, there are a number of players
who have withdrawn themselves from the championship of 64 players
(in this problem, we generalized it into 2N players). Due to the nature
of the competition, which is a regular knock-out tournament, and also
the short notice of the withdrawals, some matches had been walkover
matches (also known as a w/o, a victory due to the absent of the op-
ponent).

If both players are available then there will be a normal match, one
of them will advance to the next phase. If only one player is available
then there will be a walkover match, and he/she will automatically
advance. If no player is available then there will be no match.

In the right figure, the player #3 and #4 are withdrawn from the
tournament, leaving a total of one w/o match (at match #3).

Given the list of players who withdraw right before the tournament
start, calculate how many w/o matches to happen in the whole tourna-
ment, assuming that all of the remaining players play until the end of
the tournament (winning or knocked-out).

## Output

```
The first line of input contains an integer T , the number of test cases to follow. Each case begins with
two integers, N (1  N  10) and M (0  M  2N ). The next line contains M integers, denoting the
players who have withdrawn themselves right before the tournament. The players are numbered from
1 to 2N , ordered by their position in the tournament draw.
