title: Uva 10145  Lock Manager
---


```
You are invited to be a part of the team that is developing yet another DBMS (Data Base Management
System). You will be responsible for the Lock Manager.

Locks control concurrent access to data items by multiple transactions. Your DBMS is simple and
uses only Shared (S) and Exclusive (X) mode locks. Each lock request contains a lock mode (S or X), a
transaction identifier and a data item identifier. Multiple locks can be granted to the same data item
as long as none of them conflict.

Two locks for the same data item conflict if:

 they belong to different transactions, and

 at least one of them is exclusive (X) mode lock.

At the earliest stages of development you are asked to write very simple lock manager that processes
lock requests. The lock is granted if it does not conflict with previously granted locks for this data
item. Your task is simple: locks, once granted, are never released or changed in any way. If lock request
is denied due to conflict with some previously granted lock, then transaction making this request is
blocked and all further requests from this transaction are ignored.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input consists of an integer indicating the number of test cases in the input. Then
there is a blank line and the test cases separated by a blank line.

Each test case consists of a number of lock requests, each request on a different line. Requests have
the following format:

MODE TRID ITEM

Where MODE is a single capital letter S or X denoting requested lock mode. TRID and ITEM
are transaction identifier and data item identifier correspondingly. Both TRID and ITEM are integers,
both are greater than zero, and both consist of at most 9 decimal digits.

There are at least one and at most 10000 requests in each test case.
The last request is followed by a line consisting of a single character #.

```

## Output

```
Your program shall sequentially process all requests from from each test case. For each request you
should write one line that contains the response to the request. The following responses are allowed:

 GRANTED  the lock request does not conflict with any previously granted locks and is granted.

 DENIED  the lock request conflicts with some previously granted lock and is denied, thus blocking
the requesting transaction.

 IGNORED  the transaction was blocked on some request before this one.

Responses shall appear in all capital letters exactly as shown above.
Print a blank line between consecutive cases.
