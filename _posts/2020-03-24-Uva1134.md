## Input

```
Every computer science student knows binary trees. Here is one of many possible definitions of binary
trees. Binary trees are defined inductively. A binary tree t is either an external node (leaf)  or a
single ordered pair (t1, t2) of two binary trees, left subtree t1 and right subtree t2 respectively, called an
internal node . Given an integer n, B(n) is the set of trees with n leaves. For instance, the picture
below shows the two trees of B(3) = {(, (, )), ((; , ), )}.

Observe that those trees both have two internal nodes and a total of five nodes.
Given a tree t we define its unique integer identifier N(t):

1. N() = 0

2. N(t1, t2) = 2n1+n2 + 2n2N(t1) + N(t2), where n1 and n2 are the number of nodes in t1 and t2
respectively.

For instance, we have N(, ) = 22 + 21  0 + 0 = 4, N(, (, )) = 24 + 23  0 + 4 = 20 and
N((, ), ) = 24 + 21  4 + 0 = 24.

The ordering  is defined on binary trees as follows:

  t
(t1, t2)  (u1, u2), when t1  u1 and t1 = u1, or t1 = u1 and t2  u2

Hence for instance, (, (, ))  ((, ), ) holds, since we have   (, ).

Using the ordering , B(n) can be sorted. Then, given a tree t in B(n), we define S(t) as the tree
that immediately follows t in the sorted presentation of B(n), or as the smallest tree in B(n), if t is
maximal in B(n). For instance, we have S(, ) = (, ) and S(, (, )) = ((, ), ). By composing the
inverse of N ,S and N we finally define a partial map on integers.

s(k) = N(S(N1(k)))

Write a program that computes s(k).

## Output

```
The first input line contains an integer K, with K > 0. It is followed by K lines, each specifying an
integer ki with 1  i  K and 0  ki < 231.
