## Input

```
A group of Z friends is going to the movies. They have already reserved some specific locations in the
theater. As a kind of ritual, every friend likes to drink something while seeing the film.

Locations at the theater are disposed in a rectangular array of R rows and C columns. Rows are
named sequentially with English capital letters (A, B, C, ). Columns are named with integers (1, 2,
3, , C). Then, locations are identified by a string formed by the corresponding row letter and column
number of the location.

Locations at the theater are chairs with plastic supports at both arms, to put a drink on each one.
Supports are shared by neighbor locations but, of course, it is expected that at most one person uses a
support to put his/her drink, but there is no etiquette rule that forces someone to use the right or the
left support of his/her chair.

As a matter of example, the next figure illustrates a theater with 3 rows
and 5 columns. Locations are depicted with rectangular forms, and supports
with circles at both sides of them.

The group of friends goes to occupy the reserved locations. Before them,
some persons came and occupied some of the locations (different from those of
the group) and everyone used one support for a drink. Is it possible that the
group of friends sit at their locations warranting that everyone in the group
can put his/her drink on a support that corresponds to his/her location?
Clearly, sometimes the spectators that came before the group may have used
the supports in such a way that not everyone in the group may use a support for his/her drink.
```

## Output

```
There are several cases to consider. Each case begins with a line with two integer numbers R and C,
indicating the number of rows and columns in the theater (1  R  26, 2  C  99). The next line
contains an integer number P indicating the number of persons that came to the theater before than
the group (0  P  R  C  1). Each one of the next P lines contains two text strings; the first one
corresponds to the location id (one letter, one integer numeral) and, the second one is an one-character
string with a sign - or a sign + denoting the fact that the person is using the left or the right support
of his/her location, respectively. The next line contains an integer number Z indicating the number of
persons in the group of friends (1  Z  R C P ). Finally, each one of the following Z lines contains
the locations ids of the reserved seats for the group of friends. In each case, you may suppose that the
given identifiers are distinct and that every drink was put in an empty support before the friends came.

Each line in a case description has no leading spaces and items on a line are separated by exactly
one space. There are no spaces at the end of any line. Input ends with a line with two 0 values.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case output a line with one of the texts YES or NO depending on the fact that the group of
friends can occupy their seats and use some of the supports to place their drinks with the constraints
imposed by the already occupied seats and supports.
