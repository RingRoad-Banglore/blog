title: Uva 12124  Assemble

```
Recently your team noticed that the computer you use to practice for programming contests is not
good enough anymore. Therefore, you decide to buy a new computer.

To make the ideal computer for your needs, you decide to buy separate components and assemble
the computer yourself. You need to buy exactly one of each type of component.

The problem is which components to buy. As you all know, the quality of a computer is equal to
the quality of its weakest component. Therefore, you want to maximize the quality of the component
with the lowest quality, while not exceeding your budget.
```

## Input

```
On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:

 One line with two integers: 1  n  1000, the number of available components and 1  b 
1000000000, your budget.

 n lines in the following format: type name price quality, where type is a string with the type
of the component, name is a string with the unique name of the component, price is an integer
(0  price  1000000) which represents the price of the component and quality is an integer
(0  quality  1000000000) which represents the quality of the component (higher is better). The
strings contain only letters, digits and underscores and have a maximal length of 20 characters.

It will always possible to construct a computer with your budget.

```

## Output

```
Per testcase:

 One line with one integer: the maximal possible quality.
