title: Uva 12234  Gift Hunting
---


## Input

```text
After winning two coupons for the largest shopping mart in your city, you cant wait inviting your
girlfriend for gift hunting. Having inspected hundreds of kinds of souvenirs, toys and cosmetics, you
finally narrowed down the candidate list to only n gifts, numbered 1 to n. Each gift has a happiness
value that measures how happy your girlfriend would be, if you get this gift for her. Some of them are
special  you must get it for your girlfriend (note that whether a gift is special has nothing to do with
its happiness value).

Coupon 1 can be used to buy gifts with total price not greater than V 1 (RMB). Like most other
coupons, you cant get any money back if the total price is strictly smaller than V 1. Coupon 2 is
almost the same, except that its worth V 2. Coupons should be used separately. That means you
cannot combine them into a super-coupon thats worth V 1 + V 2. You have to divide the gifts you
choose into two part, one uses coupon 1, the other uses coupon 2.

It is your girlfriends birthday today. According to the rules of the mart, she can take one (only
one) gift for FREE! Here comes your challenge: how to make your girlfriend as happy as possible?
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each case begins with 3 integers V 1, V 2 and n (1  V 1  500, 1 
V 2  50, 1  n  300), the values of coupon 1 and coupon 2 respectively, and the number of candidate
gifts. Each of the following n lines describes a gift with 3 integers: P , H and S, where P is the price,
H is the happiness (1  P,H  1000), S = 1 if and only if this is a special gift  you must buy it (or
get it for free). Otherwise S = 0. The last test case is followed by V 1 = V 2 = n = 0, which should not
be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and the maximal total happiness of your girlfriend. If you
cant finish the task, i.e. you are not able to buy all special gifts even with the 1-FREE bonus, the
happiness is -1 (negative happiness means shes unhappy).

Print a blank line after the output of each test case.
