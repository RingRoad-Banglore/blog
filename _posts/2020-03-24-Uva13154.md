title: Uva 13154  Extreme XOR Sum
---


## Input

```
Imagine you have an array of n integers a = [a0, a1, a2, . . . , an1]. To find the extreme sum of them you
have to do the following operations:

1. Create a new list t = [a0 + a1, a1 + a2, . . . , an2 + an1].

2. Let a = t.

3. If a has only one element remaining, exit. Otherwise go to 1.

The last remaining element is the extreme sum for the given array. Extreme sum for a = [1, 2, 4] is
9.

To find the extreme XOR Sum, you have to do XOR operation instead of addition operation (in
the step 1 above).

You are given an array of integers a. You have to answer q queries. Each query has the form of
b e. You have to find the extreme XOR sum of the array [ab, ab+1, ab+2 . . . ae].
```

## Output

```
The first line contains T (1  T  25). For each test case:

 The first line contains n (1  n  104).

 The second line contains n integers denoting the array a. Each element of the array will be an
integer between 0 and 109.

 The third line contains q (1  q  30000).

 Each of the next q lines contains two integers b and e (0  b  e < n).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number in the first line. In the next q lines, print a single line, the
extreme XOR sum for the range [b, e] for the corresponding query.

```

## Sample Output

```
1
5
1 4 6 7 8
3
0 0
0 1
2 4

```
