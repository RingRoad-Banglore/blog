title: Uva 12208  How Many Ones Needed
---


```
To write binary numbers we need only two digits 0 and 1. To write a specific value
we need a fixed number of ones, but of course number of zeroes may vary because
of leading zeroes. For example to write values between 5 and 10 (inclusive) we need
total 12 ones as shown in the figure on the left. You have to write a program that
finds total number of ones that are required to write numbers in binary within a
given range a and b.
```

## Input

```
The input file can contain up to 11000 lines of inputs. Each line contains two
positive integers a and b (0  a  b  2000000000).

Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes. This line should not be
processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input of input produce one line of output. This line contains the
serial of output followed by an integer which denotes the number of 1s required to
write all the values between a and b (inclusive) in binary. Look at the output for
sample input for details.

```

## Sample Input

```
5 10
20 30
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 12
Case 2: 35
```
