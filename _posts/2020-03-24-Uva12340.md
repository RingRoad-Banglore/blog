title: Uva 12340  Integer Grouping
---


## Input

```text
Given N distinct integers, A1, A2, , AN you have to organize the integers into m groups such that
each integer is a member of exactly one group. And a group should follow the following conditions:

1. Each group should contain at least two integers.

2. If a1a2 . . . ak (a1 < a2 < . . . < ak) are the integers of a particular group then

a) ai and ai+1 have to share a common divisor greater than 1, for all i = 1 to k  1

b) a1  M

c) ak  M

where M is the median of the N integers (from A1, A2, , AN ). Median of an N element array
can be found by first sorting the array and then picking its middle element if N is odd and average
of 2 middle elements if N is even.

Here we say m as the cardinality. You have to find two such group configurations - one with
maximum cardinality and another with minimum cardinality.
```

## Output

```text
First line of input will be number of test cases, T (T  60).
Each test case will be described by 2 lines  first line will contain the integer N (1  N  200).

The next line will contain N integers, Ai (2  Ai  109) separated by a single space.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, you should start your output by Case x: where x is the test case number starting
from 1. If it is impossible to find such grouping that complies with the above-mentioned conditions,
you should output Impossible (without the quotes). Otherwise, you should output maximum (m1)
and minimum (m2) cardinality of the groups in one line. In the next m1 lines, you should output the
m1 groups for maximum cardinality and then in the next m2 lines, you should output the m2 groups
for minimum cardinality. The numbers in each line should be in ascending order. However, the groups
themselves can be outputted in any order. If there are many possible group configurations that yield
maximal / minimal cardinality, output any of them.

```

## Sample Output
