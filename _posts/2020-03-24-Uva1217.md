title: Uva 01217  Route Planning
---


## Input

```

Superior Island is a very picturesque island and only bicycles are allowed on the island. Therefore,
there are many one-way bicycle roads connecting the different best photo-shooting spots on the island.
To help the visitors plan their trip to the island, the tourism commission wants to designate r different
bicycle routes that go through some of the best photo-shooting spots on the island. Given a map of
all the bicycle roads on the island and a list of the best photo-shooting spots to be included on each of
the three planned routes (non-listed spots must not be included in the route), please write a program
to plan each of the r routes so that the distance on each route is minimal.

Note that each best photo-shooting spot may only appear at most once on the route.
```

## Output

```
There are two parts to the input.

The first part of input gives the information of the bicycle roads on the island. The first line contains
two integer n and r, n  100 and r  10, indicating that there are n best photo-shooting spots on the
island and there are r routes to be planned. The next n lines (line 2 through line n+1) contains nn
integers (n lines with n integers on each line), where the j-th integer on line i denotes the distance from
best photo-shooting spot i  1 to best photo-shooting spot j; the distances are all between 0 and 10,
where 0 indicates that there is no one-way road going from best photo-shooting spot i 1 to spot j.

The second part of input has r lines, denoting the r sightseeing routes to be planed. Each line
lists the best photo-shooting stops to be included in that route. The integers on each line denote the
recommended photo-shooting stops on that particular sightseeing route. The first integer on the line is
the starting point of the route and the last integer is the last stop on the route. However, the stops in
between can be visited in any order.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output r integers on r lines (one integer per line) indicating the distance of each of the r planned
routes. If a route is not possible, output 0.
