## Input

```text
The European Football Championship is coming! From the 12th of June to the 4th of July, Portugal
will be the sports center of the world. Everyone will do their best to make this event a memorable one.

However, an important detail is missing. The rules for the
classification of the league stage have changed and everyone is
a little bit confused. What would be really, really nice would
be a computer program to calculate this classification, given the
results of the game. Then it would also be possible to watch in
real time the changes in the ranking!

Here is how the classification is made:

1. For a win 3 points will be awarded; for a tie, 1 point; for a
defeat, 0 points

2. For establishing the final places, the following criteria will
be applied, in descending order of priority:

 Number of points
 Goal-Average (difference between goals scored and

given)
 Number of wins (victories)
 Number of goals scored

So after the games are taken in account, this parameters are all calculated. Things get interesting
when there is more than one team with the same number of points. In that case, a sub-league is
considered. You must now imagine that only the games between the tied teams count, and see the new
sub-classification. If that does not break the tie (in points) for all the teams, you must do a sub-sub-
league for all the teams that are still tied, and so on. There is only one case when a sub-league should
not be partitioned. That is when all the teams in that sub-league have the same number of points and
obviously, the partition would give the exact same group of teams and parameters. In that cases, teams
should be ranked according to the four parameters calculated for that sub-league. If the parameters
are not sufficient, then the teams should be considered to be in the same place, and they should appear
in alphabetical order.

Your task is to write a program that given the results of several games, calculates the classification
of the teams using the sorting algorithm defined above.

Of course that knowing how good programmer you are, the organization has asked you to make a
program that could calculate the classification of thousands of teams more than the ones that will be
present in Euro2004, in order to use the program in any situation they want.

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases that follow.

Each test case starts with a number G (1  G  10000) indicating the number of games to consider.
Then G lines follow, each one with the format TEAM1 TEAM2 GOALS1 GOALS2, giving the

result of a single game (TEAM1 scored GOALS1 goals and TEAM2 scored GOALS2). Team names
are made only by lower-case letters and have a maximum length of 20.

It is not necessary that games between all the teams have been made. Of course that you should
only calculate the classification based on the games that you were given. Also, some teams may play
against each other more than one time.

To make the classification you should consider all the teams that played at least one game. You
may assume that the number of teams is  10000

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output for each test case consists of lines in the form PLACE TEAM, in ascending order of
place, where PLACE indicates the place the team got and TEAM is the name of the team. Remember
that all teams that played at least one game must appear.

Output of different test cases should be separated by a single blank line.
See the example output for a more detailed explanation of how the classification was obtained on

that particular cases.

Explanation of Sample I/O:

 First sample case:
Looking at the games, we see that portugal, espanha and grecia made 6 points, and
russia made 0 points (which automatically gives them the 4th place). A tie between the first
three teams is achieved. A sub-league with only that three teams is then considered but in this
sub-league all the three teams have 3 points. This tied group cannot be partitioned further and
then the other parameters are considered. Since in that sub-league, portugal has the best goal-
average, it achieves 1st place. Then comes espanha (2nd goal-average) and finally grecia. If
necessary, the other parameters would have been taken in account.

 Second sample case:
Now, portugal and grecia are tied with 6 points, and espanha and russia have 3
points. The sub-league between portugal and grecia unties the two teams (portugal
won against grecia), and in the same way the sub-league between espanha and russia
unties them.

 Third sample case:
The only two teams tied the game, so they are equal in all parameters. They are in the same
place and they appear in alphabetical order.
