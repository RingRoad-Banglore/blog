## Input

```text
Rita loves her Birthday parties. She is really happy when blowing
the candles at the Happy Birthdays clap melody. Every year since
the age of four she adds her birthday candles (one for every year
of age) to a candle box. Her younger daydreaming brother Theo
started doing the same at the age of three. Rita and Theo boxes
look the same, and so do the candles.

One day Rita decided to count how many candles she had in
her box:

 No, no, no! Im younger than that!
She just realized Theo had thrown some of his birthday can-

dles in her box all these years. Can you help Rita fix the number
of candles in her candle box?

Given the difference between the ages of Rita and Theo, the
number of candles in Ritas box, and the number of candles in
Theos box, find out how many candles Rita needs to remove from
her box such that it contains the right number of candles.
