## Input

```text
Yu Zhou likes to play Go with Su Lu. From the historical research, we found that there are much
difference on the rules between ancient go and modern go.

Here is the rules for ancient go they were playing:

 The game is played on a 8  8 cell board, the chess can be put on the intersection of the board
lines, so there are 9 9 different positions to put the chess.

 Yu Zhou always takes the black and Su Lu the white. They put the chess onto the game board
alternately.

 The chess of the same color makes connected components(connected by the board lines), for each
of the components, if its not connected with any of the empty cells, this component dies and will
be removed from the game board.

 When one of the player makes his move, check the opponents components first. After remov-
ing the dead opponents components, check with the players components and remove the dead
components.

One day, Yu Zhou was playing ancient go with Su Lu at home. Its Yu Zhous move now. But they
had to go for an emergency military action. Little Qiao looked at the game board and would like to
know whether Yu Zhou has a move to kill at least one of Su Lus chess.
