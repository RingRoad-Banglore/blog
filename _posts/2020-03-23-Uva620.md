620 Cellular Structure
A chain of connected cells of two types A and B composes a cellular structure of some microorganisms
of species APUDOTDLS.

If no mutation had happened during growth of an organism, its cellular chain would take one of the
following forms:

• simple stage O = A
• fully-grown stage O = OAB
• mutagenic stage O = BOA

Sample notation O = OA means that if we added to chain of a healthy organism a cell A from the
right hand side, we would end up also with a chain of a healthy organism. It would grow by one cell A.

A laboratory researches a cluster of these organisms. Your task is to write a program which could
find out a current stage of growth and health of an organism, given its cellular chain sequence.

## Input
A integer n being a number of cellular chains to test, and then n consecutive lines containing chains of
tested organisms.

## Output
For each tested chain give (in separate lines) proper answers:

SIMPLE for simple stage
FULLY-GROWN for fully-grown stage
MUTAGENIC for mutagenic stage
MUTANT any other (in case of mutated organisms)

If an organism were in two stages of growth at the same time the first option from the list above
should be given as an answer.

## Sample Input
<p>4</p><p>A</p><p>AAB</p><p>BAAB</p><p>BAABA</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>SIMPLE</p><p>FULLY-GROWN</p><p>MUTANT</p><p>MUTAGENIC</p>
