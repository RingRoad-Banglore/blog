## Input

```text
You are given a recursive function, which has the following form:

f(0, 0) = 1

f(n, r) =

k1
i=0

f(n 1, r  i) when [(n > 0) and (0  r < n(k  1) + 1)]

f(n, r) = 0 otherwise

Now, you have to find:

x =


n(k1)

i=0

f(n, i)


 mod m, where m = 102

A partially filled table for k = 3
```

## Output

```text
There will be less than 1001 lines of inputs in the input file. Each line will contain three integers: k
(0 < k < 1019), n (0 < n < 1019) and t (0 < t < 10). Input will be terminated by three zeros for the
value of k, n and t. You must not process this case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, output the value of x. The output should be in the format shown in the sample
output.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1234 1234 4
2323 99999999999 8
4 99999 9
888 888 8
0 0 0
