## Input

```
Roses are red, violets are blue...

Millionaire Mr Smith is well-known  not for his wealth, but for his odd sense of art... Mr Smith
has got a circular garden. On the boundary he picks three points and gets a triangle. He then finds
the largest circle in that triangular region. So he gets something like this:

Mr Smith then plants yellow sunflowers,
blue violets and red roses in the way shown in
the figure. (Nice combination, eh? :-) Given
the lengths of the three sides of the triangle,
you are to find the areas of the regions with
each kind of flowers respectively.
```
