title: Uva 12174  Shuffle
---


```

You are listening to your music collection using the shuffle function to keep the music surprising. You
assume that the shuffle algorithm of your music player makes a random permutation of the songs in
the playlist and plays the songs in that order until all songs have been played. Then it reshuffles and
starts playing the list again.

You have a history of the songs that have been played. However, your record of the history of played
songs is not complete, as you started recording songs at a certain point in time and a number of songs
might already have been played. From this history, you want to know at how many different points in
the future the next reshuffle might occur.

A potential future reshuffle position is valid if it divides the recorded history into intervals of length
s (the number of songs in the playlist) with the first and last interval possibly containing less than s
songs and no interval contains a specific song more than once.
```

## Input

```
On the first line there exists one positive number: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that
per test case there exists:

 One line with two integers s and n (1  s, n  100000): the number of different songs in the
playlist and the number of songs in the recorded playlist history.

 One line with n space separated integers, x1, x2, . . . , xn (1  xi  s): the recorded playlist history.

```

## Output

```
Per test case there exists:

 One line with the number of future positions the next reshuffle can be at. If the history could not
be generated by the above mentioned algorithm, output 0.
