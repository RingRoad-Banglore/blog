title: Uva 11657  Rational Billiard
---


## Input

```
The International Billiard Manufactory (IBM) builds the best
billiard tables in the world. Its last product is the Rational Bil-
liard, which is a friction-less table with volume-less balls. This
means that balls just occupy a point in the space, and once they
are struck with the cue, they move on the table with constant
velocity, until they hit another ball.

IBM wants you to build a program to analyse the behavior of
balls in the Rational Billiard. The program has to decide whether
a ball, struck with certain angle, will hit another ball in certain
position. The figure shows the configuration of the table and the
balls: m and n are integer values that indicate the size of the
table. (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the first and
second ball respectivelly, with 0 < x1, x2 < m and 0 < y1, y2 < n.
The direction in which the first ball is struck is determined by the
integer values p and q. More precisely, the slope q

p
determines the

hitting direction of the cue, where p and q cannot be zero simultaneously. A value of p = 0 means that
the ball moves parallel to the vertical axis, according to the sign of q. When the ball hits an edge, it
rebounds like if the edge were a mirror (incidence angle = reflection angle). In the special case when
the ball hits a corner, it is reflected on the same line but in the opposite direction of arrival. Finally,
spin effects are neglected, too.

## Output

```
Each line in the input corresponds to a test case specified by eight integer values: m,n, x1, y1, x2, y2, p
and q, with 0 < m,n  1000, 0 < x1, x2 < m, 0 < y1, y2 < n, 1000  p, q  1000, and |p|+ |q| > 0.

The end of the input is specified by a line with the string 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the program must output a line with the the text HIT if the first ball hits the
second ball, or MISS if it does not.
