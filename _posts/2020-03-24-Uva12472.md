title: Uva 12472  Binary Substring
---


```
Binary string of an integer is the string representation of it in binary without any leading zero. For
example binary string of 5 is 101 where binary string of 13 is 1101.

A substring is any contiguous portion of a string. For example 01 is a substring of 1011 but
00 and 111 are not.

Given A, B and P . Find the smallest integer S such that P is a binary substring of S and A  S
and S  B. 1  A,B, P  1015 and A  B.

For example, A = 9, B = 20, P = 5 (101). 10 (1010) is the smallest number in that range
containing P as a substring.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T  1000, denoting the number of test cases followed by T test cases. Each
of the following T lines will contain three space separated integers A, B and P .

```

## Output

```
For each case, print a line of the form Case < x >: < S >, where x is the case number and S is the
number (in decimal). If there is no valid S, then output NONE (quotes for clarity).

```

## Sample Input

```
4
10 20 5
10 100 9
1 1000 7
10 20 21

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 10
Case 2: 18
Case 3: 7
Case 4: NONE
```
