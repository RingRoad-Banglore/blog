title: Uva 11116  Babel Towers

## Input

```
Babel Inc. is a company that designs structures for skyscrapers. They have developed a simple technique
to estimate the feasibility of a design, based on the fact that their designs are equivalent to stack blocks
of circular section and constant height. The height of a block is used as the unit of lineal measure.

Blocks are all made of the same non deformable uniform material, so that
the weight of a block is proportional to its volume and its center of mass
is the geometrical center of the block. A typical block is of the form which
weight is determined by the radius of the circular section (because every one
has height 1).

For n  1, an n-tower is a stack of n blocks. Blocks in an n-tower
are numbered 0, 1, . . . , n 1 , from the bottom to the top. Given
an n-tower, its k-subtower is defined as the k-tower with the first
k blocks of the n-tower, 0  k < n . An example of a 5-tower
could look like the following figure:

A tower is feasible when it can be built putting its blocks one
by one from bottom to top. At each building step the correspond-
ing subtower should be stable, i.e., every block of it must remain in the position that it is designed to
stay. When placing a block results in a stack of blocks which part of it has a center of mass that lies
out of the base on that it is supported we say that the resulting tower collapses and is unfeasible.

Babel Inc. does not consider stable a situation where the center of mass of the system of blocks that
are supposed to rest on a block lies on the border of the supporting surface. For instance, two blocks
of the same dimensions with one of them placed centered on the circumference of the other constitute
a 2-tower that collapses; but if the second one is placed within the circle of the first one the system is
feasible.

Your problem is to help Babel Inc. in the evaluation of tower designs. Given a design for a n-tower
you must judge if it is feasible and, if it is not, you must tell at which floor it would collapse. In this
last case you give k as answer, with 0 < k < n, if the (k  1)-subtower is feasible but the k-subtower
collapses.

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases.
Each test case begins with a line indicating N , 0 < N < 1000, the number of blocks that the

designed tower should have.
Then, there is a line describing each one of the blocks. The block k, 0  k < N , is described by a

line containing 3 integers separated by blanks, of the form

xk yk rk

which indicates that the block k with radius rk must be placed supported on the block k1 (exception:
block 0 is placed on the ground) with its center of mass on the point xk, yk, k + 0.5 with respect to a
grid with origin in 0, 0, 0 , for xk, yk  |105| and 1  rk  105.

A case begin with N = 0 means that there are no more cases to analyze.

## Sample Input

```
Output texts for each input case are presented in the same order that input is read.

For each test case the answer must be of the form Feasible if the design is feasible. In other case,
the answer should be of the form Unfeasible k indicating that the (k  1)-subtower is feasible but
the k-subtower is unfeasible.
