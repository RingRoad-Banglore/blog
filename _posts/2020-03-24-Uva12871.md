title: Uva 12871  Landmine Cleaner
---


## Input

```text
In this problem, you are in a Landmine Cleaner (LC) team. Landmine Cleaners job is to identify and
dispose of all landmines in a field so that troops can safely march through the field. Obviously, this
is an extremely dangerous job! The first step in the process of landmine disposal is to identify where
they are. Luckily, you have a Landmine Detector Drone (LDD) to help you locate the mines. LDD
works by flying over a suspected area and send out a Z-ray, which is a military classified ray. If there
is a mine below, the Z-ray will reflect from the mine and the LDD will pickup a strong signal. LDD
however, is not perfect, because nearby mines can also reflect Z-ray and cause LDD to pick-up some
amount of signal, albeit weaker. Your job in this problem is to determine where the mines are using
the information from LDD signals. Remember, your fellow teammates life depend critically on the
correctness of your solution!

The field in this problem is an N (1  N  1, 000) rows by M (1  M  1, 000) columns grid of
cells. A cell can either have 1 or 0 mine at the center. You are given the signal reading from LDD when
it flies over the center of each cell. Consider 3 3 cells whose center cell is where your LDD is at. The
LDD signal reading at the center cell will be equal to:

If the center cell has landmine, 3 + number of landmines in the 3x3 cells
If the center cell does not have landmine, 0 + number of landmines in the 3x3 cells

In the following examples, L indicates that there is a landmine in that cell, while - indicates that
there is no landmine in that cell.

Your task in this problem is to determine for each cell if there is a landmine or not.

Note: You can safely assume that there is no landmine outside the field. You can also be sure that
the solution is unique.

## Output

```text
There are T test cases. The first line contains the number T (1  T  10). Then, T test cases follow,
each using the following format.

 The first line consists of two integers N and M .

 Each of the next N line has M integers specify the LDD signal reading at each cell, each row per
line, starting from the first row to the last row. In each line, there are M integers which indicate
the reading of the specific row, starting from the first column to the last column.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, you have to output N lines, each line is a length M string of - and L indicating
whether there is a landmine or not.
