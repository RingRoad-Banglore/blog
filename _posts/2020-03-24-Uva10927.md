title: Uva 10927  Bright lights

## Input

```
The famous contempory art designer Momo is preparing its new open-air exhibit. It will consist of
randomly placed poles emitting lasers in horizontal direction. All the lasers shall reach the so-called
laser totem T. However, as the poles are placed randomly at different heights, a laser light L might be
hidden behind a taller pole P, if P, T and L are aligned and if the height of P is larger or equal to the
pole where L is attached.

Your job is, given a configuration of poles, determine which are the visible poles.
```

## Output

```
The input is a file containing several data sets. Each data set composed as follows. The first line
contains an integer 0 < N  100000, giving the number of poles. The following N lines contain three
integers 100000  X  100000, 0  Y  10000, and 0  Z  10000 such that X and Y are the
coordinates of the pole and Z is the height of the pole in the position (X,Y ). You can assume that
in a given data set, no two poles have the same X and Y coordinates and the position of the totem is
(0, 0) and its height is infinite. The input ends with a line containing the number 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output of the program shall indicate if all lights are visible or not. If some lights are invisible
from the laser totem, the program shall output their X and Y coordinates, in increasing order of
X-coordinate and Y -coordinate. Put a semicolon between the coordinates of two points that are not
visible and put a dot after the coordinates of the last point that is not visible. See the sample output
for an example of the expected formatting of the output.
