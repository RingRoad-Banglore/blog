## Input

```
You are about to finish your favorite game... (put the name of your favorite game here). And now you
are on the last level. You have almost finished it but there is one hard quest that you want to avoid.
So again you are going for shortcut. The shortcut is again to solve a puzzle. The puzzle is given as an
m n grid where each cell colored in red, blue or green. You are also given a target grid. You have to
change given grid the to the target grid.

The only allowed operation is pressing a switch. After some trial and error you figured out how the
switch works. It rearranges the element by reading them by one diagonal after another. And put them
back row wise. See he tables below for details.

Then each cell is recolored using following rule:

A cell (i, j) is recolored only if (i + j) is even. (The cells are numbered (1, 1) for the left
top point and (m,n) for the right bottom point). However, no cells in bottommost row or
rightmost column are recolored, even if (i+ j) is even.
For recoloring 3 cells are considered. The cell right to it, the cell below it and the cell itself.
The recoloring rule is color(current, below, right) = f(current, f(below, right)). Where the
f function is defined by following table.

For example the following grid will be read as RBBRGRGBBBRRBBRRBGGG and it will be
transformed into the grid shown in below.

After recoloring

Now you are wondering given the initial configuration how long it will take to solve the puzzle or
whether it is impossible to solve in fewer than 224 steps.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T  100. T test cases follow.

Each test case starts with two positive integers m, n (3  m,n and m  n  25). Then follows m
lines, each containing n space separated characters, representing the initial grid. Then follows another
m lines, each containing n space separated characters, representing the target grid. Both grids are
followed by an empty line. See Sample IO for detail.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case print one line containing number of steps needed to reach the solution or -1 if solution
can not be reached in less than 224 steps.
