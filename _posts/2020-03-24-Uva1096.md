## Input

```text
Wen Chen is the captain of a rescue boat. One of his
important tasks is to visit a group of islands once
a day to check if everything is all right. Captain
Wen starts from the west-most island, makes a pass
to the east-most island visiting some of the islands,
then makes a second pass from the east-most island
back to the first one visiting the remaining islands.
In each pass Captain Wen moves steadily east (in the
first pass) or west (in the second pass), but moves as
far north or south as he needs to reach the islands.
The only complication is that there are two special
islands where Wen gets fuel for his boat, so he must
visit them in separate passes. Figure 7 shows the two
special islands in pink (1 and 3) and one possible path Captain Wen could take.

Calculate the length of the shortest path to visit all the islands in two passes when each islands
location and the identification of the two special islands are given.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of multiple test cases. The data for each case begins with a line containing 3 integers
n (4  n  100), b1, and b2 (0 < b1, b2 < n1 and b1 = b2), where n is the number of islands (numbered
0 to n  1) and b1 and b2 are the two special islands. Following this, there are n lines containing the
integer x and ycoordinates of each island (0  x, y  2000), starting with island 0. No two islands
have the same xcoordinate and they are in order from west-most to east-most (that is, minimum
xcoordinate to maximum xcoordinate).

Input for the last case is followed by a line containing 3 zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, display two lines. The first line contains the case number and the length of the shortest
tour Captain Wen can take to visit all the islands, rounded and displayed to the nearest hundredth.
The second line contains a space-separated list of the islands in the order that they should be visited,
starting with island 0 and 1, and ending with island 0. Each test case will have a unique solution.
Follow the format in the sample output.
