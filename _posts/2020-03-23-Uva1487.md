1487 Volume
This time your job is to calculate the volume of a special object. The object consists of two orthogonal
cylinders. The two cylinders intersect each other in the middle place. One example is shown in Fig. 1.
The radiuses of the bottom disk of both cylinders are R, and the heights of both cylinders are H.

## Input
We test the problem in many cases. Each case includes two integers, the first one is R and the second
one is H. All the numbers given are positive integers and are less than 100.

## Output
The output consists of the volumes. The results must be round to 4 decimal numbers. Remember that
R may be less than half of H.

## Sample Input
