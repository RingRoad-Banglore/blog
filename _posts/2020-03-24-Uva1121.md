## Input

```text

A sequence of N positive integers (10 < N < 100 000), each of them less than or equal 10000, and
a positive integer S (S < 100 000 000) are given. Write a program to find the minimal length of the
subsequence of consecutive elements of the sequence, the sum of which is greater than or equal to S.
```

## Output

```text
Many test cases will be given. For each test case the program has to read the numbers N and S,
separated by an interval, from the first line. The numbers of the sequence are given in the second line
of the test case, separated by intervals. The input will finish with the end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each the case the program has to print the result on separate line of the output file.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 15

5 1 3 5 10 7 4 9 2 8

5 11

1 2 3 4 5
