10282 Babelfish
You have just moved from Waterloo to a big city. The people here speak an incomprehensible dialect
of a foreign language. Fortunately, you have a dictionary to help you understand them.

## Input
Input consists of up to 100,000 dictionary entries, followed by a blank line, followed by a message of up
to 100,000 words. Each dictionary entry is a line containing an English word, followed by a space and
a foreign language word. No foreign word appears more than once in the dictionary. The message is a
sequence of words in the foreign language, one word on each line. Each word in the input is a sequence
of at most 10 lowercase letters.

## Output
Output is the message translated to English, one word per line. Foreign words not in the dictionary
should be translated as ‘eh’.

## Sample Input
<p>dog ogday</p><p>cat atcay</p><p>pig igpay</p><p>froot ootfray</p><p>loops oopslay</p><p></p><p>atcay</p><p>ittenkay</p><p>oopslay</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>cat</p><p>eh</p><p>loops</p>
