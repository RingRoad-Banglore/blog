title: Uva 11930  Rectangles
---


## Input

```text
Given a set of rectangles in the plane, determine if
it is possible to choose one diagonal from each rect-
angle such that none of the selected diagonals inter-
sect. Two diagonals intersect if they share at least
one point. Note that the rectangles themselves are
free to intersect.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. Each test case
begins with an integer n (1  n  1000), represent-
ing the number of rectangles. This is followed by n
lines each describing a rectangle using 8 integer num-
bers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, where each (xi, yi) is
a vertex. All coordinate values are between 109 and
109. The input is terminated by a line containing 0
which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing either YES if the selection is possible or NO if not.
