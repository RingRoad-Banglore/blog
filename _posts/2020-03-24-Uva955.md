title: Uva 00955  Interpreting Old Maps

## Input

```

Before the invention of instruments for determining latitude and longitude, maps could only be crude
representations of the regions of the earth surface. Ancient maps, in fact, only indicated approximate
locations for cities or natural spots. The relative positions of the main spots would be approximately
correct, but the relative positions of neighboring cities were often completely wrong. Despite the
technological limitations, and the creativity that was used to decide about what could not be known,
some ancient maps already provided estimates for latitude and longitude.

It has been observed that road information was a source of information for determining the relative
positions of cities and, in particular, the geographical coordinates. In fact, it turns out that the relative
positions of some of the cities are completely consistent with road information known through other
historical sources.

Since the old maps have a large number of cities and respective coordinates, it is very hard to find
out which cities were placed in the map using road information known to us through other sources. A
computer program to automate that task is definitely needed.

Example

The figure provides an example. There is a road with cities A, B, C and D. There are two variants
for the distance between A and B. On the map, cities B and D were placed with reference to A while
city C was placed with reference to B. From the two possible distances between A and B, 11 and
40, the second was used. Note that


(19.3)2 + (35.1)2  40. City D was placed at a distance of

67.92 + 31.92  75. Which can be explained as the sum 11+30+34.
```

## Output

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive
test cases are separated by a single blank line.

The idea is to focus on a single road. The main input for the program consists of the list of cities,
identified by their coordinates in the map, and the road distances between them. There is the problem
that historical documents dont agree in all distances, so all variants must be taken into account. The
following format is used:

N
X1 Y1
M1 D1,a D1,b . . .
X2 Y2
. . .
MN1 DN1,a DN1,b . . .
XN YN

Where: N is the number of cities in the road, (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . , (XN , YN ) are the coordinates
of the cities in the order in which they appear in the road, Mi is the number of alternative (variant)
distances between cities i and i+ 1, and Di, are the variant distances themselves.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The result is a list of the pairs of cities, i and j, with i < j, for which the relative positions in the
map are consistent with road distances (or one of them, when there are variants). For each pair of cities
in these conditions, a line with the following format should be printed:

i j Di,j,1 Di,j,2

Where Di,j, are the intervening road distances, which must sum up to a value that is equal to the
straight line distance between those cities in the input map. The listing is sorted by i and then by j.
Between each value in the same line, there is a blank space.

Note:
None of the test cases contains a pair of cities for which multiple solutions can be found. In other

words, there is a single list of distances Di,j, suming up to a value that is equal to the straight line
distance between cities i and j.
