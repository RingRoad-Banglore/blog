title: Uva 00679  Dropping Balls
---


## Input

```text
A number of K balls are dropped one by one from the root of a fully binary tree structure FBT. Each
time the ball being dropped first visits a non-terminal node. It then keeps moving down, either follows
the path of the left subtree, or follows the path of the right subtree, until it stops at one of the leaf
nodes of FBT. To determine a balls moving direction a flag is set up in every non-terminal node with
two values, either false or true. Initially, all of the flags are false. When visiting a non-terminal node
if the flags current value at this node is false, then the ball will first switch this flags value, i.e., from
the false to the true, and then follow the left subtree of this node to keep moving down. Otherwise,
it will also switch this flags value, i.e., from the true to the false, but will follow the right subtree of
this node to keep moving down. Furthermore, all nodes of FBT are sequentially numbered, starting at
1 with nodes on depth 1, and then those on depth 2, and so on. Nodes on any depth are numbered
from left to right.

For example, Fig. 1 represents a fully binary tree of maximum depth 4 with the node numbers 1,
2, 3, ..., 15. Since all of the flags are initially set to be false, the first ball being dropped will switch
flags values at node 1, node 2, and node 4 before it finally stops at position 8. The second ball being
dropped will switch flags values at node 1, node 3, and node 6, and stop at position 12. Obviously,
the third ball being dropped will switch flags values at node 1, node 2, and node 5 before it stops at
position 10.

Fig. 1: An example of FBT with the maximum depth 4 and sequential node numbers.

Now consider a number of test cases where two values will be given for each test. The first value is
D, the maximum depth of FBT, and the second one is I, the I-th ball being dropped. You may assume
the value of I will not exceed the total number of leaf nodes for the given FBT.

Please write a program to determine the stop position P for each test case.

For each test cases the range of two parameters D and I is as below:

2  D  20, and 1  I  524288.
