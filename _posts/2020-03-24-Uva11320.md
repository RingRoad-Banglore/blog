## Input

Figure 1: Corresponds to the first sample case

When consecutive lattice points along x-axis
are connected with consecutive lattice points
of another row above it, several triangles are
formed as shown in Figure 1.

Lattice points, are the points in two-
dimensional coordinate system whose abscissa
and ordinate has integer values. For example
(3, 4) is a lattice point but (3, 4.5) is not a lat-
tice point. Consecutive lattice points of a row
means the lattice points whose y-coordinate
value is same but whose x-coordinate value is
consecutive. Such a group of lattice points can
be specified by specifying only the x-coordinate
of the left most point and x-coordinate of the rightmost point. So to describe a system of points in two
rows, five integers are enough. Lets say these integers are x1down, x2down, x1up, x2up and h. Where
x1down and x2down are the x-coordinates of leftmost and rightmost points on x-axis respectively, h is
the distance between x-axis and the row above it. x1up and x2up are the x-coordinates of leftmost and
right most points of the row above. All points on x-axis are connected with all points on the row above
it via an straight line segment. After connecting these points many triangles is formed whose base is
the x-axis and height is less than h. In the Figure-1 x1down = 5, x2down = 8, x1up = 5 and x2up = 7
and h = 1 and there 18 such triangles are formed.

If x1down = 0, x2down = 2, x1up = 0 and x2up = 2 and h = 1 (second sample case) then nine such
triangles are formed. All these triangles are filled black in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Formed nine triangles are shown by filling them with black.

When number of lattice points on the lines are very small, then such triangles are very easy to
count, but for large number of lattice points such triangles are hard to count, let alone measuring the
average height of such triangles.

In this problem you have to do this mammoth task. Given the values of x1down, x2down, x1up,
x2up and h your job is to find the average height of all the triangles formed whose base is x-axis and
height is less than h.

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 5001 lines of inputs. Each line contains five integer numbers x1down,
x2down (0  x1down < x2down  100000 and |x1down x2down|  10000), x1up, x2up (0  x1up <
x2up  100000 and |x1up x2up|  10000) and h (0 < h  10).

Input is terminated by a line containing five zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by
a floating-point number which denotes the average height of the formed triangles. The floating point
number should have six digits after the decimal point. Errors less than 1.5  106 will be ignored. Look
at the output for sample input for details.

Note: The picture on the right illustrates how to procede in the
first sample case.
