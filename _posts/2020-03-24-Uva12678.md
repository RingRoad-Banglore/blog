title: Uva 12678  Mixing Colours

## Input

```

Frank lives in London and he really likes games and maths. Lately, he has been playing a game on his
mobile phone. It is simple, a sequence of coloured tokens is provided and each turn the player has to
combine a pair of adjacent tokens to obtain a new token of certain colour. This process is repeated
until the whole sequence results in only one final token. The problem is that not every pair of colours
can be merged. There is a set of rules describing the allowed combinations. For example, given the
following rules

blue + yellow  green
yellow + red  orange
blue + orange  brown

and the sequence (blue, yellow, red), the game could be finished obtaining a brown token after two
steps: (blue, yellow, red)  (blue, orange)  (brown).

Frank is now in Valencia attending a famous programming contest and he is waiting for the tram
to go to the university. Meanwhile, he is playing this game to fill time but the sun is shining so bright
that he can not properly see the screen of his phone. He has some certainty about the possible colour
of each token and he is wondering what will be the resulting colour following the most likely play of
the game according to his estimation of the input sequence. Given Franks estimation of two colours
A and B, and the combination A + B  C, the certainty of the obtained colour C is computed as
cer(C) = cer(A)  cer(B).
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several data sets, each of them as described below. Consecutive
data sets are separated by a single blank line.

The first line contains R (0 < R  100) the number of rules describing the allowed combinations
of colours. Each of the following R lines contains three strings s1, s2, s3 representing the combination
s1+ s2  s3. Next line shows the number of test cases T . For each test case an integer C indicates the
length of the input sequence of tokens (0 < C  500). Each of the next C lines describes a token, it
contains a list of pairs (k, cer(k)) providing a colour k and its corresponding certainty (0 < cer(k)  1.0).
The list ends with the word END. The sum of the certainties for a certain token always is 1.0. Every
colour in a test case has appeared first in the rules describing the game.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each data set in the input the output must follow the description below. The outputs
of two consecutive data sets will be separated by a blank line.

For each test case, print the resulting colour of the most likely play of the game. If there is no
possible combination to finish the game then print GAMEOVER.

EXPLANATION OF THE SAMPLES:

First case

In the first case there are only two tokens. Frank is sure that the second token is Yellow, but the
first token could be either Red or Orange. There are two possible solutions to the game:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12678  Mixing Colours 2/2

1. (Red, Yellow)  (Orange) :
cer(Orange) = 0.7

2. (Orange, Yellow)  (Yellow) :
cer(Yellow) = 0.3

Hence, according to Franks estimation the most likely play is the number 1 such that the final colour
is Orange.

Second case
In the second case there are several tokens and estimations. Two possible solutions are:

1. (Blue,Yellow,Yellow,Red)  (Blue,Yellow,Orange)  (Blue,Yellow)  (Green)
cer(Green) = 0.006

2. (Green,Red,White,Black)  (Green,Pink,Black)  (Green,Red)  (Yellow)
cer(Yellow) = 0.036

Hence, according to Franks estimation the most likely play is the number 2 such that the final colour
is Yellow.

Third case
In this final case Frank is sure that there are two tokens Blue and Orange. There is no rule in the

defined game that allows the combination of those colours, hence, there is no solution for this sequence
of tokens.
