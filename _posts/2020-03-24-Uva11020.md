## Input

```text
Our marriage ceremonies are solemn, sober

moments of reflection; also regret, disagreement,
argument and mutual recrimination. Once you know

it cant get any worse, you can relax and enjoy
the marriage.

J.Michael Straczynski, "The Deconstruction of Falling Stars."

The princess of Centauri Prime is the galaxys most eligible bachelorette of the year. She has hopeful
grooms lined up in front of the royal palace for a chance to spend 5 minutes to try and impress her.
After 5 minutes, the gentleman is carried out of the royal chambers by the palace guards, and the
princess makes a decision. She rates the lad on his lineage and charm by giving him a score for each of
the two properties. On Centauri Prime, low scores are better than high scores.

Suppose that she observes two gentlemen - A and B. She assigns A the scores LA and CA (for lineage
and charm, respectively). B receives scores LB and CB. Then A is dominated by B if either

 LB < LA and CB  CA, or

 LB  LA and CB < CA.

In other words, if at least one of Bs scores is better than As, and the other score is not worse. She
considers a gentleman to be efficient (or Pareto-optimal) if she has not yet met any other gentleman who
dominates him. She maintains a list of efficient grooms and updates it after each 5-minute presentation.

Given the queue of bachelors and the scores assigned to them by the princess, determine the number
of entries in the list of efficient grooms after each performance.

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (0 < N < 40). N test cases follow.

Each one starts with a line containing n (0  n  15000)  the size of the queue. The next n lines
will each contain two scores (integers in the range [0, 109]). Initially, the list is empty.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by n lines, line i containing the size
of the list of efficient grooms after the i-th update. Print an empty line between test cases.
