## Input

```
A D0L (Deterministic Lindenmayer system without interaction) system consists of a finite set  of
symbols (the alphabet), a finite set P of productions and a starting string . The productions in P
are of the form x  u, where x   and u  + (u is called the right side of the production), +
is the set of all strings of symbols from  excluding the empty string. Such productions represent
the transformation of the symbol x into the string u. For each symbol x  , P contains exactly
one production of the form x  u. Direct derivation from string u1 to u2 consists of replacing each
occurrence of the symbol x   in u1 by the string on the right side of the production for that symbol.
The language of the D0L system consists of all strings which can be derived from the starting string 
by a sequence of the direct derivations.

Suppose that the alphabet consists of two symbols a and b. So the set of productions includes two
productions of the form a u, b v, where u and v  {a, b}+, and the starting string   {a, b}+.
Can you answer whether there exists a string in the language of the D0L system of the form xzy for
a given string z? (x and y are some strings from ,  is the set of all strings of symbols from ,
including the empty string.). Certainly you can. Write the program which will solve this problem.
```

## Output

```
The input file of the program consists of several blocks of lines. Each block includes four lines. There
are no empty lines between any successive two blocks. The first line of a block contains the right side
of the production for the symbol a. The second one contains the right side of the production for the
symbol b and the third one contains the starting string  and the fourth line the given string z. The
right sides of the productions, the given string z and the starting string  are at most 15 characters
long.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each block in the input file there is one line in the output file containing YES or NO according to
the solution of the given problem.
