## Input

```text
Golf and sex are about the only things
you can enjoy without being good at.

Jimmy Demaret

Relaxed Golf is a solitaire game. Cards are dealt face up in 7 columns of 5 cards each. The
remaining 17 cards are put face down into the draw pile. Suits dont matter, so we will represent cards
using integers between 1 (Ace) and 13 (King), four of each. For this problem, we will know the order
of the cards in the draw pile. Finally, we have the discard pile. The goal of the game is to put all of
the cards into the discard pile.

A move consists of playing a card from the top of the draw pile or the top of one of the non-empty
columns on top of the discard pile. When playing from the columns, the rank of card played must differ
by exactly one from the rank of the card on top of the discard pile. In Relaxed Golf (as opposed to
regular Golf), wraparound is allowed. Kings may be played on top of aces, and vice versa. We can play
cards from the draw pile onto the discard pile at any time. In fact, the first move must be from the
draw pile.
