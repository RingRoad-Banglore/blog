title: Uva 01251  Repeated Substitution with Sed
---


```

Do you know sed, a tool provided with Unix? Its most popular use is to substitute every occurrence of
a string  contained in the input string (actually each input line) with another string . More precisely,
it proceeds as follows.

1. Within the input string, every non-overlapping (but possibly adjacent) occurrences of  are
marked. If there is more than one possibility for non-overlapping matching, the leftmost one
is chosen.

2. Each of the marked occurrences is substituted with  to obtain the output string; other parts of
the input string remain intact.

For example, when  is aa and  is bca, an input string aaxaaa will produce bcaxbcaa, but
not aaxbcaa nor bcaxabca. Further application of the same substitution to the string bcaxbcaa
will result in bcaxbcbca, but this is another substitution, which is counted as the second one.

In this problem, a set of substitution pairs (i, i) (i = 1, 2, . . . , n), an initial string , and a
final string  are given, and you must investigate how to produce  from  with a minimum number
of substitutions. A single substitution (i, i) here means simultaneously substituting all the non-
overlapping occurrences of i, in the sense described above, with i.

You may use a specific substitution (i, i) multiple times, including zero times.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of multiple datasets, each in the following format.

n
1 1
2 2
...

n n



n is a positive integer indicating the number of pairs. i and i are separated by a single space. You
may assume that 1  |i| < |i|  10 for any i (|s| means the length of the string s), i = j for any
i = j, n  10 and 1  || < ||  10. All the strings consist solely of lowercase letters. The end of the
input is indicated by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Output

```
For each dataset, output the minimum number of substitutions to obtain  from . If  cannot be
produced from  with the given set of substitutions, output -1.
