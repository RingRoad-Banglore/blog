title: Uva 00292  Presentation Error
---


## Input

```text
One of the main burdens of the Jury of the Scholastic Programming Contest is not to decide whether a
submitted program is incorrect, but how to classify the error. In the past, we had 'Failed Testcase',
'Wrong Answer', 'Wrong Output Format' and 'Too much/Too Little Output' to worry about.

The interpretation of these messages depended largely on the jury member involved. For instance,
while some believe that 'Wrong Answer' indicates that all answers are wrong, and 'Failed Testcase'
applies when at least one answer is right, others feel that 'Wrong Answer' should be used if more than
one answer is wrong, and 'Failed Testcase' only if exactly one test went wrong.

Fortunately, all these worries are gone, since now we only need to distinguish between 'Wrong
Answer', 'Presentation Error' and 'Accepted' (all other messages are the result of compilation
errors, run-time errors, and non-terminating programs).

To eliminate any subjectivity in deciding between a Presentation Error and a Wrong Answer,
the Jury of this years Programming Contest has defined an exact procedure to determine whether a
program produces a 'Wrong Answer', a 'Presentation Error', or should be Accepted.

In the description of the rules, we distinguish between JuryOut and SubmitOut, as the output
intended by the Jury, and the output submitted, respectively. The JuryOut contains parts which are
considered essential in the output of a correct algorithm. Those essentials are placed between [ and ].
Those brackets are not part of the output, thus they should not appear in SubmitOut. The algorithm
to decide between 'Accepted', 'Wrong Answer' and 'Presentation Error' is as follows:

1. From each line in both outputs, all trailing white space (blanks and tabs) should be removed.
After that, all trailing empty lines should be removed.

2. If after step 1, JuryOut and SubmitOut are identical, the algorithm returns 'Accepted'.

3. All letters in both outputs are changed to uppercase (including those between square brackets).

4. We name the essentials E1 through En.

5. If each of the strings E1 through En occurs as a string in SubmitOut, and Ei comes after (without
overlapping) Ei1, for all 2  i  n, then the algorithm returns 'Presentation Error'.

6. The algorithm returns 'Wrong Answer'.

As we (the Jury) need to have such a program (and we need it NOW), your job is to write it for us.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains on the first line the number of test cases (N). Each test case has on its first line the
number (J) of lines in JuryOut, and the number (S) of SubmitOut lines, separated by a single space.
Then follow the J lines of JuryOut and the S lines of SubmitOut. Both JuryOut and SubmitOut are
no longer than 10 lines. A line is at most 80 characters long. Essentials are non-empty strings that do
not cross line boundaries. The first and last characters of an essential are not white space. Essentials
will not be nested.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output has to be Accepted, Wrong Answer, or Presentation Error on a single line for each
test case.

## Sample Output

```text

1 2
Just one line?
Just one line?

2 2
The first characters of the alphabet are:
[abcde]
Here they come:
a b c d e
1 1
That's it: [abcde]
That's it: AbCdE
1 1
[2] and [3] make [5]
I guess 2 and 3 are less than 50.
