title: Uva 10816  Travel in Desert
---


```
There is a group of adventurers who like
to travel in the desert. Everyone knows
travelling in desert can be very danger-
ous. Thats why they plan their trip care-
fully every time. There are a lot of fac-
tors to consider before they make their
final decision.

One of the most important factors is
the weather. It is undesirable to travel
under extremely high temperature. They
always try to avoid going to the hottest
place. However, it is unavoidable some-
times as it might be on the only way to
the destination. To decide where to go,
they will pick a route that the highest
temperature is minimized. If more than one route satisfy this criterion, they will choose the shortest
one.

There are several oases in the desert where they can take a rest. That means they are travelling
from oasis to oasis before reaching the destination. They know the lengths and the temperatures of the
paths between oases. You are to write a program and plan the route for them.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases. Your program must process all of them.

The first line contains two integers N and E (1  N  100; 1  E  10000) where N represents the
number of oasis and E represents the number of paths between them. Next line contains two distinct
integers S and T (1  S, T  N) representing the starting point and the destination respectively. The
following E lines are the information the group gathered. Each line contains 2 integers X,Y and 2 real
numbers R and D (1  X,Y  N ; 20  R  50; 0 < D  40). It means there is a path between X and
Y , with length D km and highest temperature RoC. Each real number has exactly one digit after the
decimal point. There might be more than one path between a pair of oases.

```

## Output

```
Print two lines for each test case. The first line should give the route you find, and the second should
contain its length and maximum temperature.
