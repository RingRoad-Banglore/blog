title: Uva 13103  Tobby and Seven
---


## Input

```
Tobby has a very special number, when this number is divided by 7 the remainder is 0. Every time
that Tobby thinks about this property, he says: WOW, this is a wonderful number!

As everybody knows Tobby is not a common pet, he is smart and curious, so he decides to modify
the original number as follows: Tobby writes the number in its binary representation, then he chooses
two indexes and make a swap operation of the values of those positions, and then he does several
other similar operations for a while. Tobby does not remember the total number of operations that he
performed, he just remembers the positions in the binary representation that were swapped at some
point and he also remembers that the most significant bit was never swapped.

Now Tobby wants to recover the original number, but Tobby is a busy pet and so he does not have
time for that. Can you help him?
```

## Output

```
The input has several test cases. Each test case has three lines, the first line contains a single integer n
(7  n  260), the modified number. The second line contains an integer k (2  k  20) representing
the amount of positions that were swapped and the third line contains k different integers in increasing
order, the positions (relative to the least significant bit) of the number that were swapped (zero-indexed).

```

## Sample Input

```
Print a single integer: the recovered number which is divisible by 7. If there are several answers, then
print the maximum possible value.

Explication:
In the first sample the original number (without swaps) is 91
Tobby remembers that in sometime the positions 0, 1, 2, 4 and 5 were swapped.
Suppose that Tobby did the follow swap operations:
6 5 4 3 2 1 0 = indexes
1 0 1 1 0 1 1 = 91
swap(0, 2, 1011011)  1 0 1 1 1 1 0 = 94
swap(4, 5, 1011110)  1 1 0 1 1 1 0 = 110
swap(0, 1, 1101110)  1 1 0 1 1 0 1 = 109
swap(2, 4, 1101101)  1 1 1 1 0 0 1 = 121
swap(0, 1, 1111001)  1 1 1 1 0 1 0 = 122
swap(2, 4, 1111010)  1 1 0 1 1 1 0 = 110
swap(0, 5, 1101110)  1 0 0 1 1 1 1 = 79
Note that Tobby can swap the same index many times, note also that the position 6 was never

swapped.

```

## Sample Output

```

0 1 2 4 5
