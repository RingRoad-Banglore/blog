title: Uva 01643  Angle and Squares
---


## Input

```text

Figure 1

Here is a geometric problem. You have an angle and some squares
in the first quadrant of the plane rectangular coordinates. The
vertex of the angle is fixed on the origin O of the coordinates, and
both of its radial lines are specified by the input. The sizes of the
squares are also specified by the input, and the squares can shift
vertically and horizontally. Now your job is to use the squares
and the radial lines of the angle to enclose the maximum area,
which excludes the area of the squares (see Figure 1). You should
note that the edges of the squares must be parallel to the axes.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases. Each test case starts with a line
consisting of one positive integer N (0 < N < 10), which is
the number of the squares. The next line contains four decimal
numbers: xa, ya, xb, yb, which denote two points A (xa, ya) and B
(xb, yb). The radial lines OA and OB form the angle. Each of the following N lines contains a decimal
number, which is the edge length of a square. All the decimal numbers mentioned above are in the
range [1, 20]. A test case with N = 0 ends the input, and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each data case, output one line containing a decimal number, which is the maximum area that can
be enclosed by the radial lines of the angle and the squares. The value should be rounded to three
digits after the decimal point.
