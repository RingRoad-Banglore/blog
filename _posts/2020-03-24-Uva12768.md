One of the largest problems facing university students is
procrastination (in fact, Im procrastinating writing my
thesis right now!).

Lets think about our life as a series of decisions. Each
decision influences which life-paths you go down. At each
point in your life, you will have many options to get you
to other points. Those decisions may lead you on new ad-
ventures or back to places youve already been (e.g., final
exams, which we will consider to be the same point in
your first term as in the last year of studies). Each op-
tion comes with a procrastination-factor. The higher the
procrastination-factor, the more you are procrastinating.
The total amount of procrastination done in your life-time
is the sum of all procrastination-factors of the decisions you
made along the way.

Given a series of life events and the possible decisions
from each one, what is the most amount of procrastination
you can accumulate over the remainder of your life-time?
```

## Input

```
Input file contains at most 16 test cases. First line of each test case contains two integers N and M
(1  N  100, 0  M  N  (N  1)), where N is the number of life-points and M is the number of
decisions. Then follow M lines, each containing three integers A, B and F (1  A,B  N , A = B,
|F |  1, 000) denoting that when you are at life-point A, you can make the decision to go to life-point
B with a procrastination factor of F . All decisions will be unique (i.e., there is at most one way to
go directly from point A to point B). You are currently on life-point 1. Input is terminated by a line
containing two zeroes.

```

## Output

```
For each test case produce one line of output containing the most amount of procrastination that you
can possibly accumulate over your life-time. If there is no limit to the amount of procrastination you
can do, output Unlimited!.
