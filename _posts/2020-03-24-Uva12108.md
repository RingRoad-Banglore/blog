## Input

```text
When a student is too tired, he cant help sleeping in class, even if his favorite teacher is right here in
front of him. Imagine you have a class of extraordinarily tired students, how long do you have to wait,
before all the students are listening to you and wont sleep any more? In order to complete this task,
you need to understand how students behave.

When a student is awaken, he struggles for a minutes listening to the teacher (after all, its too bad
to sleep all the time). After that, he counts the number of awaken and sleeping students (including
himself). If there are strictly more sleeping students than awaken students, he sleeps for b minutes.
Otherwise, he struggles for another a minutes, because he knew that when there is only very few sleeping
students, there is a big chance for them to be punished! Note that a student counts the number of
sleeping students only when he wants to sleep again.

Now that you understand each student could be described by two integers a and b, the length of
awaken and sleeping period. If there are always more sleeping students, these two periods continue
again and again. We combine an awaken period with a sleeping period after it, and call the combined
period an awaken-sleeping period. For example, a student with a = 1 and b = 4 has an awaken-sleeping
period of awaken-sleeping-sleeping-sleeping-sleeping. In this problem, we need another parameter c
(1  c  a + b) to describe a students initial condition: the initial position in his awaken-sleeping
period. The 1st and 2nd position of the period discussed above are awaken and sleeping, respectively.

Now we use a triple (a, b, c) to describe a student. Suppose there are three students (2, 4, 1), (1, 5,
2) and (1, 4, 3), all the students will be awaken at time 18. The details are shown in the table below.

Write a program to calculate the first time when all the students are not sleeping.

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains a single integer n (1  n 
10), the number of students. This is followed by n lines, each describing a student. Each of these lines
contains three integers a, b, c (1  a, b  5), described above. The last test case is followed by a single
zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and the first time all the students are awaken. If itll never
happen, output -1.
