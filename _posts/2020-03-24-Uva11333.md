title: Uva 11333  Alphametics
---


## Input

```text
Alphametics is a term coined by J.A.H. Hunter to design those puzzles where letters represent decimal
digits that make true a certain mathematical relation. A well known example for this is the puzzle:

S E N D
+ M O R E

M O N E Y

In this context, Alphametic Cryptarithm Masters (ACM) is a recently founded enterprise that is
interested on applications of this kind of puzzles to cryptography. For that reason, they want to develop
software to solve a reduced family of alphametics in an automated way and you are supposed to help
them in this task.

Alphametic puzzles of interest to ACM satisfy the following constraints:

 Puzzles are stated by means of an arithmetic equation of the form described by the regular
expression:

word (op word) = word (op word)

where word is a sequence of uppercase characters of the English alphabet, and op is any of
the operators in the set {+ ,-} .

 No more than ten different characters occur in any puzzle.

 There will be at least one blank between words, operators and the equality symbol = .

 Each letter in the puzzle statement stands for a different decimal digit 0 , . . . , 9 .

 Each word represents a decimal number.

 + and - operators stand for the usual addition and substraction operations.

 Numbers represented by words cannot begin by leading zeroes. We say that a word representing
a number begins with a leading zero if it has at least two characters and its left-most character
represents zero.

A solution for an alphametic puzzle is a value assignment for the letters in the words of the puzzle
statement, such that the equation is satisfied.

## Output

```text
The problem input consists of several cases, each one defined by a line with the puzzle statement as
described above. It is guaranteed that every problem statement is well formed. The end of the input
corresponds to the end of the input file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output texts for each input case are presented in the same order that the input is read. For an input
case in the puzzle statement, the output should be a ten character expression

c0c1    c9

where ck is the letter of the statement whose value is the digit k. If the digit k is not assigned to any
letter, ck should be an asterisk, so the given assignment is a solution for the puzzle instance. If such
a solution does not exist, a line with ten asterisks should be written.
