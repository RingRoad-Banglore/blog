title: Uva 13289  Kabobs

## Input

```text
Anna wants to open a marvelous restaurant, Candy Mountain, serving only candy kabobs: sticks on
which one puts various pieces of food, to be eaten from the tip to the base.

Like other kabob enthusiasts, when Anna eats a pattern of consecutive types of food in a kabob,
she expects to eat another pattern later in the kabob. For instance, once she eats a piece of apple
immediately followed by a piece of banana, she expects to have a leaf of mint immediately followed
by chocolate in the remaining part of the kabob. She is happy if she finds this mint-chocolate pattern
anywhere in the remaining kabob pieces.

Here is a kabob that Anna likes:

Apple-Banana-Watermelon-Plum-Watermelon-Plum-Watermelon-Mint-Chocolate

or, graphically:

A B W WP P W M C

Anna has written down her perfect set of kabob patterns for the new restaurant, but she worries
that these rules would give too many potential kabob types. This set of patterns is written down as a
ruleset, where each rule is of the form b implies e afterwards, where b and e are non-empty sequences
of characters, representing food pieces. A rule of the form b > e with b = b1 . . . bk and e = e1 . . . el means
that, if the pattern b is encountered in the kabob, then the kabob should also contain e at some point
after. Each bi+1 must immediately follow bi to trigger the rule and similarly each ej+1 must immediately
follow ej to satisfy it, but bk and e1 do not need to be consecutive. No food piece can appear more
than once in a rule (i.e., there is no i, j such that ej = bi and no i = j with bi = bj or ei = ej) but a
food piece can appear in several rules.

Note that if there are several occurrences of the word b in a kabob, they all need to be followed by
an e. This can be a single e, as long as this e appears after all the b.

In a ruleset, rules are separated by | and are of the form u > v meaning that each pattern u implies
a pattern v afterwards. u and v are words composed of alphanumerical characters and no character
can appear twice in a rule. For instance, the ruleset AB>X|R>A|T>B describes three rules:

 for each AB there must be an X afterwards;

 for each R there must be an A afterwards; and

 for each T there must be a B afterwards.

Using this ruleset, the kabobs SBSB, REA, ABX, BA, ABXBA, RRA, TBTB, and RTABX are valid; but RAT, TAB,
and ABXAB are not.

Anna asks you how many kabobs of a given size are compatible with her ruleset.

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

 The first line contains an integer K, the size of all kabobs, followed with a space, and a non-empty
string S of alphanumerical characters (A to Z, a to z, and 0 to 9), representing the elements
that can be used in a kabob (no characters appear twice in S).



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 13289  Kabobs 2/2

 The second line contains a non-empty string R, which contains no spaces and represents a ruleset
as described above. The patterns in R are composed of characters from S only.

Limits
The input is such that 1  K  500 and 3  |R|  60.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output is one integer: the number of kabobs of length K satisfying all the rules
in R, modulo 10 000 000, on a line by itself.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4 ABC
A>B|B>C|CB>A

```
