title: Uva 12998  Tree Weights
---


## Input

```
A rooted tree with N nodes is given. Nodes are labeled 1 to N , 1 being the root of the tree. Each of
the leaves of this tree has a value assigned to it, which is zero at the beginning. The value for each
internal node U is calculated as the sum of the values of all the nodes in the sub-tree rooted at U . An
internal node is a node, which has at least one child node.

You will be given two kinds of operations:

Type 1: given U , find the value of node U .

Type 2: given U and X, increase the value of the leaf U with X.
```

## Output

```
First line starts with T (0 < T  10), number of test cases. Each of the case starts with N (0 < N 
105), number of nodes in the tree. Next there will be N  1 lines each containing two integers U and
V , indicating an edge between U and V . Next there will be Q (0 < Q  105), number of operations.
Next Q line will contain firstly TP (1 or 2), the type of the operation. Then based on the operation
type, there will be one or two integers, U or U and X (1  U  N , |X|  109). In case of TP = 2, U
will always be a leaf node.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print case number. Then for each operation of type 1, print the answer in a separate
line. As value of the nodes can get huge, print the answer modulo 1,000,000,007. See sample I/O for
more clarification.
