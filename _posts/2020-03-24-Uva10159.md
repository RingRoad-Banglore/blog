```
A board contains 48 triangular cells. In each cell,
there is written a digit (in a range from 0 through 9).
Every cell belongs to two or three lines. These lines
are marked by letters from A through L.

An example is depicted on the Figure. There, the
cell containing digit 9, belongs to lines D, G and I.
The cell containing digit 7, belongs to lines B and I.

For each line, A, B, C, ..., L, we consider the
largest digit lying on it. In the above example, the
largest digit for line A is 5, for line B is 7, for line E
is 6, for line H is 0, for line J is 8 and so on.

Write a program, that inputs the largest digit for
any one of the depicted 12 lines. The program should
find out the smallest and the largest possible sum of
digits located in all the cells of the board.
```

## Input

```
Every line in the input contains 12 digits, each two of them separated by a space. The first of these
digits means the largest one in line A, the second means the largest one in line B, and so on, the last
digit means the largest one in line L.

```

## Output

```
For every line in the input file write the value of the smallest and of the largest possible sum of digits
located in the cells of the board, on a single line. These two values should be separated by one space
exactly. If there does not exists a solution, your program must outputs the words NO SOLUTION instead
of the above two values.

```

## Sample Input

```
5 7 8 9 6 1 9 0 9 8 4 6

```

## Sample Output

```
40 172
