title: Uva 11389  The Bus Driver Problem
---


```
In a city there are n bus drivers. Also there are n morning bus routes and n afternoon bus routes with
various lengths. Each driver is assigned one morning route and one evening route. For any driver, if
his total route length for a day exceeds d, he has to be paid overtime for every hour after the first d
hours at a flat r taka / hour. Your task is to assign one morning route and one evening route to each
bus driver so that the total overtime amount that the authority has to pay is minimized.
```

## Input

```
The first line of each test case has three integers n, d and r, as described above. In the second line, there
are n space separated integers which are the lengths of the morning routes given in meters. Similarly the
third line has n space separated integers denoting the evening route lengths. The lengths are positive
integers less than or equal to 10000. The end of input is denoted by a case with three 0s.

```

```
For each test case, print the minimum possible overtime amount that the authority must pay.
