Contrary to the popular belief, alien flying saucers cannot fly arbitrarily around our planet Earth.
Their touch down and take off maneuvers are extremely energy consuming, so they carefully plan their
mission to Earth to touch down in one particular place, then hover above the ground carrying out their
mission, then take off. It was all so easy when human civilization was in its infancy, since flying saucers
can hover above all the trees and building, and their shortest path from one mission point to the other
was usually a simple straight line  the most efficient way to travel. However, modern cities have so
tall skyscrapers that flying saucers cannot hover above them and the task of navigating modern city
became quite a complex one. You were hired by an alien spy to write a piece of software that will
ultimately give flying saucers driving directions throughout the city. As your first assignment (to prove
your worth to your alien masters) you should write a program that computes the shortest distance for
a flying saucer from one point to another. This program will be used by aliens as an aid in planning of
mission energy requirements.

The problem is simplified by several facts. First of all, since flying saucer can hover above most of
the buildings, you are only concerned with locations of skyscrapers. Second, the problem is actually
twodimensional  you can look at everything from above and pretend that all objects are situated
on OXY Cartesian plane. Flying saucer is represented by a circle of radius r, and since modern cities
with skyscrapers tend to be regular, every skyscraper is represented with a rectangle whose sides are
parallel to OX and OY axes.

By definition, the location of flying saucer is the location of its center, and the length of the path it
travels is the length of the path its center travels. During its mission flying saucer can touch skyscrapers
but it cannot intersect them.

At the first picture a flying saucer of r = 1 has to get from point A to point B. The straight dashed
line would have been the shortest path if not for skyscraper 1. The shortest way to avoid skyscraper 1
is going around its top right corner, but skyscraper 2 is too close to fly there. Thus, the answer is to
go around the bottom left corner of skyscraper 1 for a total path length of 10.570796.

In the second picture it is impossible for a flying saucer of r = 2 to get from point A to point B,
since all skyscrapers are too close to fly in between them.

In the third picture flying saucer of r = 1 has to fly in a slalom-like way around two skyscrapers in
order to achieve the shortest path of length 11.652892 between A and B.

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1387  Driving Directions 2/2

The first line of the input file contains integer numbers r and n (1  r  100, 0  n  30), where r
is the radius of the flying saucer, and n is the number of skyscrapers. The next line contains four integer
numbers xA, yA, xB, and yB (1000  xA, yA, xB, yB  1000), where (xA, yA) are the coordinates of
the starting point of the flying saucers mission and (xB, yB) are the coordinates of its finishing point.

The following n lines describe skyscrapers. Each skyscraper is represented by four integer numbers
x1, y1, x2, and y2 (1000  x1, y1, x2, y2  1000, x1 < x2 , y1 < y2)  coordinates of the corners of
the corresponding rectangle.

Skyscrapers neither intersect nor touch each other. Starting and finishing points of the flying saucers
mission are valid locations for flying saucer, that is, it does not intersect any skyscraper in those points,
but may touch some of them.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write to the output a line with the text no solution (without quotes) if the flying
saucer cannot reach its finishing point from the starting one. Otherwise, write to the output a line with
a single number  the shortest distance that the flying saucer needs to travel to get from the starting
point to the finishing point. Answer has to be precise to at least 6 digits after the decimal point.
