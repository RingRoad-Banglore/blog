## Input

```text
In the last IIUPC there was a problem called Da Vinci Code prepared on the story of the bestselling
book of Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code. Here is another problem based on his another techno-thriller
novel Digital Fortress. In this problem, you will be given a cipher text. Your task is to decipher the
text using the decrypting technique described below. Lets take an example. A cipher text is given as
follows:
WECGEWHYAAIORTNU

The output will be:
WEAREWATCHINGYOU

For this problem, there are 16 characters in the given cipher text WECGEWHYAAIORTNU which is
square of 4. These letters have to be arranged in nn (in this example 44) grid and each letter from
the given input will be placed in a grid in row major order (1st row, 2nd row, 3rd row, ...). When the
given cipher text is placed in the grid it looks like as follow:

W E C G
E W H Y
A A I O
R T N U

From the above grid if we take the letters in column major order (1st column, 2nd column, 3rd
column, ...) then we get the following decrypted text:
WEAREWATCHINGYOU
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with a line consisting of a single number T . T test cases follow. Each test case consists of
one line. This line contains the cipher text. The cipher text contains either UPPERCASE letters or blank
spaces. Total number of character in the text will not be more 10,000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output contains a single line containing the decrypted text. If the number of
characters in the input text is not square of any number, then give the output INVALID.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
WECGEWHYAAIORTNU
DAVINCICODE
