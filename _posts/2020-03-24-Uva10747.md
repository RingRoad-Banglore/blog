title: Uva 10747  Maximum Subsequence
---


```
You are given a sequence of N integers, each of which is not greater than 10,000 considering absolute
value. There are (NCK) sub-sequences possible from this sequence. You have to pick such a subsequence,
so that multiplication of all its integers is maximum.

For example, if the sequence is 4, 4, -4, -4 and you are asked to pick 2 integers. You have 2 ways,
which will satisfy the criterion. One is to pick 4,4 and the other is to pick -4, -4.

In this case, you have to consider the sub sequence whose summation of all integers is maximum.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below.

Each input set starts with 2 positive integers N , K (1  K  N  10000). Next N non-empty lines
contain N integers in total.

Input is terminated by a case where N = 0 and K = 0. This case should not be processed. There
will be at most 60 test cases.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input print in a single line the summation of the integers in the desired subsequence.
