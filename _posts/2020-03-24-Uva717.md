Turing Machine

Turing Machine (TM) was defined by mathematician Alan Turing in 1936. You probably expect
all the Contest problems to be related to the same topic, so you may now wonder what the Turing
Machine has in common with the Antique Theatre. The fact is that Alan Turing had a friend called
Fred. And Freds Grandmother was keen on Antique Tragedies. So we think it is a good idea to give
you this problem as a remembrance of Alan Turing.

Let us describe one particular TM: TM consists of two-way potentially infinite tape, read/write head
and a finite automaton control unit. The tape is an infinite one-dimensional sequence of fields. Each
field contains one symbol of an alphabet Sigma = {~, 0, 1, . . . ,M}, where ~ is a special blank symbol.
At each moment, there is just a finite number of fields not containing the blank symbol.

The head is a device capable at each step of reading one symbol from the tape field above which it
is positioned, writing another symbol on its place and moving one field to the left or right. As the tape
is two-way potentially infinite, the movement is always possible.

The control unit drives the head. At each time, it is in one state taken from Gamma = {0, 1, ..., N}.
It starts in state 0. At each step the control unit considers its actual state gamma and the symbol
under the head sigma. This information determines the symbol to be written on the tape sigma in
place of sigma, the next state to go gamma and the direction delta (R or L for right or left) for the
movement of the head.

TM description (TMD) is a triple (M,N,P ) where P is a set of rules. Each rule is a quintuple
(gamma, sigma, sigma, gamma, delta) describing the behaviour of the machine in a particular situation
as described in the preceding paragraph. If no rule exists for the current situation, the machine stops,
i.e. the calculation is finished. Conflicting (with the same gamma and sigma) rules may not exist.

In the text form, TMD starts with a line containing positive integers M and N . Then there is
an arbitrary number of lines containing each one rule. The rule is described as gamma sigma sigma
gamma delta, where gamma, sigma, sigma and gamma are integers (  should be coded as -1 and
delta from {R, L}, the symbols are separated by spaces. After the last rule, a line immediately follows
which contains only the symbol -.

When the machine starts there will be a finite string of symbols from Sigma starting under the
head position and continuing to the right. All the remaining fields on the tape are blank.

Theoretically, TM is equivalent to any general purpose computer. We ask you to at least partly
demonstrate it  you are to write a program generating TMD evaluating arbitrary Turing arithmetic
expression (TAE) for any input values. TAE is defined in the following section.

Turing Arithmetic Expression
TAE is defined by the following grammar:

 TAE  expr

 expr  factor | expr + expr

 factor  ( expr ) | factor  factor | variable

 variable  1 | 2 | ... | 9

The operators + resp. * operators stand for integer addition resp. multiplication modulo 10 (e.g.
238  17 = 6); multiplication takes precedence over addition. The syntactic element variable denotes
the value of the first, second, etc. up to ninth integer written on the tape of the TM at start time.

Task
Write a program that for each TAE outputs a TMD evaluating the TAE for any valid contents of

the tape. A valid contents of the tape is a sequence of at most nine non-negative integers written left to
right (most significant [non-zero] digit first) in a decimal notation using symbols 0, ..., 9 and separated
by one blank symbol. All the rest of the tape is blank, the head starts at the most significant digit of
the first number. The magnitude of the integers is not specified. Example of a valid tape (underline
indicates head position):

... ~ ~ ~1 ~2 3 ~ 4 7 ~ 1 1 ~ ~ ~ ~ ...

When the TM finished processing the tape should contain the result of the computation starting
with the most significant digit under the head and continuing to the right until the first blank. No
leading zeros are allowed. The contents of the rest of the tape is insignificant. For example, if the TAE
was (1+3)*2 and the tape contents as above, the correct answer would be (123 + 11)  47 mod 10 = 8.
The correct tape contents would be

x x x 8 ~ x x x

where x stands for any symbol.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of N cases. The first line of the input contains only positive integer N . Then follow
the cases. Each case is described by one line, containing one valid TAE. The line is at most 1000
characters long, does not contain any characters other than 0, 1, ..., 9, (, ), * and +, and is terminated
by the newline character.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print valid TMD that evaluates the TAE for any valid tape contents. You can assume
there will be always at least as many integers on the tape, as mentioned in the TAE.
