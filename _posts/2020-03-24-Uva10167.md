title: Uva 10167  Birthday Cake
---


```
Lucy and Lily are twins. Today is their birthday. Mother
buys a birthday cake for them. Now we put the cake onto a
Descartes coordinate. Its center is at (0, 0), and the cakes
length of radius is 100.

There are 2N (N is a integer, 1  N  50) cherries
on the cake. Mother wants to cut the cake into two halves
with a knife (of course a beeline). The twins would like to be
treated fairly, that means, the shape of the two halves must
be the same (that means the beeline must go through the
center of the cake) , and each half must have N cherrie(s).
Can you help her?

Note: the coordinate of a cherry (x, y) are two integers.
You must give the line as form two integers A, B (stands for
Ax+By = 0) each number mustnt in [500, 500]. Cherries
are not allowed lying on the beeline. For each dataset there
is at least one solution.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several scenarios. Each of them consists of 2 parts:

The first part consists of a line with a number N , the second part consists of 2N lines, each line
has two number, meaning (x, y). There is only one space between two border numbers. The input file
is ended with N = 0.

```

## Output

```
For each scenario, print a line containing two numbers A and B. There should be a space between
them. If there are many solutions, you can only print one of them.
