How many times must a man look up

Before he can see the sky?
Yes, n how many ears must one man have

Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, n how many deaths will it take till he knows

That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind,

The answer is blowin in the wind.

Another gloomy day has begun for Shahriar but as usual his CD player is singing a song of hope.
He has a large piece of paper in front of him on which he is trying to partition a number into some
co-prime numbers by hand in as many ways as possible and surely things are getting out of his control.
He wants to write a program to do this but his limited programming ability is not helping his cause.
He has already thought about asking Mr. Kisman to write a code for him but as he has already asked
too many favors from him he is looking for help from another source. Can you help him? A group of
numbers is co-prime when the GCD of any two of them is 1.

Shahriar has decided to give a party to all those who will solve this problem so he definitely wants
an efficient and intelligent solution so that number of people in the party is small and of course his
budget is limited :).
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file is an integer N (0 < N < 40), which indicates how many sets of inputs
are there. Each of the next N lines contains one set of input. Each line contains two integers S
(0 < S  100) and t (0 < t  30). So your job is to partition S into t co-prime numbers.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input you should give several lines of outputs. The description of output for each line
of input is given in the paragraph below:

First line should be the serial of the output. Next lines should contain all possible partitions of S into
t co-prime numbers. Each line should contain one possible partition. In a partition the printed numbers
should be ordered in non-decreasing order and two consecutive numbers should be separated by a single
space. The partitions should be printed in ascending order. Let say one partition is P1 = a1, a2, . . . , an
and another partition is P2 = b1, b2, . . . , bn. ak and bk are not equal and for all value of i (0 < i < k)
ai = bi. Then partition P1 > P2 iff ak > bk and P1 < P2 iff ak < bk. There can be around 15000 lines
in the output file in total.
