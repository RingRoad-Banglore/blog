out-degree. For example, if there are four edges, we get the following three trees.
```

## Output

```
The first line in the input file is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each of the test cases
follows below. Each case consists an integer representing various even values of m (2  m  500).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, first print the serial number of the case and then print the value of P separated by
an space from the serial number. You should use Big Integer operation to print P and P has maximum
200 digits.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
4
10
14
