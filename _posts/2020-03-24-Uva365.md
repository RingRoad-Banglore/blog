## Input

```
The federal government has recently passed a reform mandating that all welfare recipients must work
to receive benefits. In accordance with this, parents will receive childcare subsidies for children under
13 (i.e., the child must be younger than 13 on September 1 of this year).

The portion of childcare the parent must pay (called the parent fee) is based on income and number
of children in the family. The following chart shows an example of how parent fees are determined:

Here FAMxx means a family with xx children. Each entry in the chart represents a base salary;
successive rows in a column define a salary range. For example, in column FAM04, row 2 defines a
salary range from $7650 up to but not including $11479. The base parent fee for this salary range is
1.60, corresponding to row 2 (the start of the range). The final row defines the base parent fee for all
salaries equal to or above the entries in that row. For example, in column FAM01, any salary equal to
or above $13449 has base parent fee 9.60.

From this chart, you determine the base parent fee from the family size and income. The base
parent fee applies to the youngest child under 13; the fee for each other child under 13 is half of the
base parent fee. For example, a family with four children with an income of $8000 would have a base
parent fee of 1.60. The parent will pay 1.60 for the youngest child and 0.80 for every other child under
13. Remember that only children younger than 13 will get the child care subsidy; thus there is no
parent fee for children 13 or over. Your task is to figure out the parent fee for each child in a family.

## Output

```
The input file has two parts: the first part contains the parent fee table and the second part contains
family records.

The parent fee table is specified using the first 12 lines of the input file. Each line contains one
non-negative real number (the parent fee) and 10 non-negative integers (the incomes for families with
one to ten children), separated by one or more spaces. Note that the values in this table may differ
from those listed in the example table above, but it is guaranteed that the numbers in each column will
increase as the table is examined from top to bottom.

The family records begin on the next line. The first line of the family records section contains a
positive integer n; there are n families to process. Each family record begins with the parents name (a

string of 1 to 20 characters on its own line). The next line contains an integer k, the number of children
in the family (0  k  10) and a non-negative integer s, the familys income. The next k lines contain
the childrens birthdays, one per line. Each birthday consists of three integers of the form mm dd yy
(mm = month, dd = day, yy = year); leading zeroes will not be used for one digit months or days. All
birthdays will be valid and no child will be older than 25.

Children in the same family will not share birthdays.
Assume the first line of the input file contains 10 zeros for the incomes as shown in the sample

below.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each child, output the parent name, childs age (on September 1, 1996), and parent fee. Children
should be listed in the order they appear in the input. Leave a blank line after the output for each
family. Follow the format illustrated in the Sample Output.
