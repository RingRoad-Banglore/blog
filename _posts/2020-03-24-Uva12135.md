---


## Input

```text
You are given n bulbs and m switches. Each of the switches toggles a list of bulbs. Initially all the
bulbs are turned off. Now for a set of desired states of the bulbs calculate the minimum number of
switch presses required to reach that state.
```

## Output

```text
Input contains multiple test cases. First line contains an integer T the number of test cases. Each test
case starts with a line containing 2 integers n (1  n  15) and m (1  m  40). Next m line contains
the description of m switches. Each of these lines starts with an integer k denoting the number of
bulbs that toggles their states after pressing this switch. The rest of the line contains k distinct integers
denoting the indices of the bulbs. The bulbs are numbered from 0 to n 1. The next line contains an
integer q (1  q  5000) that denotes the number of queries. Each of the following q line contains a
binary string of length n denoting the desired states of the n bulbs: 1 means the bulb must be on and
0 means the bulb must be off. The rightmost character is the state of bulb 0 and the leftmost character
is the state of bulb n 1.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output contains q + 2 lines. First line contains Case x: where x is the number
of test cases. Each of the next q lines contains one integer denoting the minimum number of switch
presses required to reach the bulb states in the ith query. If the state cannot be reachable by a series
of switch presses output -1.

The last line will be a blank line.
