## Input

```
You are given two N  N square matri-
ces, A and B. Each of the elements of
these matrices is an integer between 1 and
K(inclusive). You have to convert ma-
trix A into matrix B in minimum num-
ber of operations. In each operation you
can choose one element of matrix A and
change it to any integer between 1 and K
(inclusive).

You have to ensure that after any op-
eration the matrix is not converted to a
symmetric matrix. A square matrix is
said to be symmetric if j-th element of
i-th row is equal to the i-th element of j-
th row for all (i, j) where 1  i  N and
1  j  N .

For example:
```

## Output

```
Input will start with an integer T (T  200), number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line
containing two integers N (1  N  100) and K (1  K  9). This line will be followed by 2N lines.
First N lines will represent matrix A and next N line will represent matrix B. Each of these 2N lines
will contain N integers, all of these integers are in between 1 and K (inclusive).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single line containing the case number followed by the minimum number of
operations required to convert A into B. If it is impossible to convert A into B obeying the rules, print
-1 instead. See output for sample input for exact formatting.
