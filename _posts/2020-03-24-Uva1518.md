title: Uva 01518  Train delays
---


```

Last year, some of the judges tried to travel to NWERC10 by train. This turned into a big disaster: on
the way there, a fire in a control room caused huge delays, while on the return trip, trains in Bremen
were delayed due to a terrorist threat in Hamburg. Of course, these huge delays caused other delays in
the train schedule, so the big question was which trains to take: would it be better to take this slow
regional train now, or wait for that intercity train, which has a big chance of being delayed?

This year, the judges have planned ahead and carefully analyzed the train schedule. They even kept
track of how often trains were delayed and by how much. Now that they have all this information,
they want to travel as quickly possible, minimizing the expected duration of the journey. Can you help
them?

For each train connection, the judges know exactly what its scheduled departure time and duration
are, as well as the probability that its arrival at the destination will be delayed. You may assume that
the probabilities of delays are independent and that the judges can adapt their itinerary as they go,
depending on any delays which they might already have incurred. Trains always depart on time, but
may arrive late and the judges do not know whether a trains arrival will be delayed until they have
boarded it. It takes judges no time to switch trains, so they can take a connecting train that departs
at the same time as they arrive at a place.

The judges can choose the time of their initial departure as they wish and they want to minimize the
expected duration (Given a travel plan of which trains to take  depending on previous connections
and delays, the expected trip duration E is defined to be the sum of the trip duration Ti for each
itinerary i possibly taken multiplied by the chance pi of that itinerary occurring: E =


i piTi.) of their

total trip.

## Input

```
On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:

 one line with the judges place of origin and destination, these are different.

 one line with an integer n (1  n  1000): the number of train connections.

 n lines, each describing a train connection:

 the origin and destination of this connection, these are different.

 an integer m (0  m  59), the departure time in minutes after each full hour.

 an integer t (1  t  300), the standard journey time (assuming no delays).

 an integer p (0  p  100), the probability of delays as a percentage.

 an integer d (1  d  120), the maximum delay in minutes.

All place names are given as strings of upper and lower case alphabetical characters, of length at
most 20. If a train is delayed, then the length of the delay will be a whole number of minutes, and will
be uniformly distributed in the range [1, d].



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1518  Train delays 2/2

```

## Output

```
Per test case:

 one line with a floating point number: the minimum expected duration of the total trip in minutes.

This number should be accurate up to 106 relative or absolute precision. Output IMPOSSIBLE
instead if the destination is not reachable.

Note in the first example that it is better to take the slower train from Hamburg to Bremen, since the
fast train would give an expected travel time of 70.25 minutes.
