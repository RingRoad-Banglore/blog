title: Uva 11701  Cantor

## Input

```text
The ternary expansion of a number is that number written in
base 3. A number can have more than one ternary expansion. A
ternary expansion is indicated with a subscript 3. For example,
1 = 13 = 0.222 . . .3, and 0.875 = 0.212121 . . .3.

The Cantor set is defined as the real numbers between 0 and
1 inclusive that have a ternary expansion that does not contain a
1. If a number has more than one ternary expansion, it is enough
for a single one to not contain a 1.

For example, 0 = 0.000 . . .3 and 1 = 0.222 . . .3, so they are
in the Cantor set. But 0.875 = 0.212121 . . .3 and this is its only
ternary expansion, so it is not in the Cantor set.

Your task is to determine whether a given number is in the
Cantor set.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing a number x
written in decimal notation, with 0  x  1, and having at most
6 digits after the decimal point.

The last line of input is END. This is not a test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output MEMBER if x is in the Cantor set, and NON-MEMBER if x is not in the Cantor
set.

```

## Sample Output

```text
0
1
0.875
END

```
