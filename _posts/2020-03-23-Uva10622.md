10622 Perfect Pth Powers
We say that x is a perfect square if, for some integer b, x = b2.
Similarly, x is a perfect cube if, for some integer b, x = b3. More
generally, x is a perfect pth power if, for some integer b, x = bp.
Given an integer x you are to determine the largest p such that
x is a perfect pth power.

## Input
Each test case is given by a line of input containing x. The value
of x will have magnitude at least 2 and be within the range of a
(32-bit) int in C, C++, and Java. A line containing ‘0’ follows
the last test case.

## Output
For each test case, output a line giving the largest integer p such
that x is a perfect pth power.
