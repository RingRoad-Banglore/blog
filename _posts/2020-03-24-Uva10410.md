title: Uva 10410  Tree Reconstruction
---


```
You have just finished a compiler design homework
question where you had to find the parse tree of an
expression. Unfortunately you left your assignment
in the library, but luckily your friend picked it up
for you. Instead of e-mailing you the parse tree so
that you can rewrite the solution, your friend decides
to play a practical joke and sends you just the DFS
and BFS trace. Rather than try to redo the entire
question you decide to reconstruct the tree.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases as described
below.

The first line of a input is the number n (1  n 
1000) of nodes in the tree. The nodes in the tree are
numbered 1, 2, . . . , n. The remaining numbers are the
BFS traversal followed by the DFS traversal. Note
that when a parent was expanded the children were
traversed in ascending order.

```

## Output

```
The output for each case should consist of n lines, one for each node. Each line should start with the
node number followed by a colon followed by a list of children in ascending order. If there is more than
one solution, any correct answer is acceptable.

```

## Sample Input

```
8
4 3 5 1 2 8 7 6
4 3 1 7 2 6 5 8

```

## Sample Output

```
1: 7
2: 6
3: 1 2
4: 3 5
5: 8
6:
7:
8:
```
