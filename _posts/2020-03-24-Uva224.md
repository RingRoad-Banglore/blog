title: Uva 00224  Kissin Cousins
---


## Input

```text
The Oxford English Dictionary defines cousin as follows:

cousin (kzn), n. (Also first cousin) child of ones uncle or aunt; my second (third...)
cousin, my parents first (second...) cousins child; my first cousin once (twice...) removed,
my first cousins child (grandchild...), also my parents (grandparents...) first cousin.

Put more precisely, any two persons whose closest common ancestor is (m+ 1) generations away from
one person and (m+ 1) + n generations away from the other are mth cousins nce removed. Normally,
m  1 and n  0, but being used to computers counting from 0, in this problem we require m  0
and n  0. This extends the normal definition so that siblings are zeroth cousins. We write such a
relationship as cousin-m-n.

If one of the persons is an ancestor of the other, p generations away where p  1, they have a
relationship descendant-p.

A relationship cousin-m1-n1 is closer than a relationship cousin-m2-n2 if m1 < m2 or (m1 = m2
and n1 < n2). A relationship descendant-p1 is closer than a relationship descendant-p2 if p1 < p2. A
descendant-p relationship is always closer than a cousin-m-n relationship.

Write a program that accepts definitions of simple relationships between individuals and displays the
closest cousin or descendant relationship, if any, which exists between arbitrary pairs of individuals.

## Output

```text
Each line in the input begins with one of the characters #, R, F or E.

# lines are comments. Ignore them.

R lines direct your program to record a relationship between two different individuals. The first 5
characters following the R constitute the name of the first person; the next 5 characters constitute the
name of the second. Case is significant. Following the names, possibly separated from them by blanks,
is a non-negative integer, k, defining the relationship. If k is 0, then the named individuals are siblings.
If k is 1, then the first named person is a child of the second. If k is 2, then the first named person is
a grandchild of the second, and so forth. Ignore anything on the line following the integer.

F lines are queries; your program is to find the closest relationship, if any, which exists between the
two different persons whose 5 character names follow the F. Ignore anything on the line following the
second name. A query should be answered only with regard to R lines which precede the query in the
input.

There will be one E line to mark the end of the input data. Ignore anything on or after the E line.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each F line, your program is to report the closest relationship that exists between the two persons
named aaaaa and bbbbb in one of the following formats:

aaaaa and bbbbb are descendant-p.
aaaaa and bbbbb are are cousin-m-n.

with m, n and p replaced by integers calculated as defined above. If no relationship exists between the
pair, your program is to output the following:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 224  Kissin Cousins 2/3

aaaaa and bbbbb are not related.

Assumption: A person is not an ancestor of himself/herself.
