```
Xiao Ming, a clever and lazy boy, is good at programming and sleeping. He hated traveling by train
very much. Nevertheless, tomorrow in the early morning hours he will travel from Liuzhou to Xian
to in order to get to the National Olympiad of Informatics in 2001 (NOI2001). Since he is afraid of
arriving too late and being excluded from the contest, he is looking for the train which gets her to
Xian as early as possible. However he dislikes getting to the station too early, so if there are several
schedules with the same arrival time, he will choose the one with the latest departure time.

Xiao Ming asks you to help him with his problem, so that she can sleep a bit longer tomorrow. You
are given a set of railroad schedules from which you have to compute the fastest connection among
those with the earliest arrival time for going from one location to another. One good thing: Xiao Ming
can switch trains in zero time.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several scenarios. Each of them consists of 3 parts:

Part one lists the names of all cities connected by the railroads. It starts with a line containing an
integer C(1  C  100) followed by C lines containing city names. These names consist of at most 20
letters.

Part two describes all the trains running during the day. It start with a number T  100 followed
by T train descriptions. Each train description consists of one line with a number ti < 100 and ti more
lines with a time and a city name, meaning that passengers can get on or off the train at that time at
that city. The times are given in the 24-hour format hhmm.

Part three consists of three lines: Line one contains the earliest possible starting time for the journey,
line two the name of the city where he starts, and line three the destination city. The two cities are
always different.

The end of the input file is marked by a line containing only a zero (instead of C). Do not process
this line.

```

## Output

```
For each scenario print one line solution. If a connection exists the print 2 four-digit numbers, meaning
hhmm, the starting time and the arriving time. If not connection exists print a line containing No
connection.
