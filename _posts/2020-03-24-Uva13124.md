## Input

```text
Little Elisa is learning her first words. With the help of her parents and friends, she has been introduced
to word search puzzles in order to practice and acquire new vocabulary. A search word puzzle consists
of a rectangular arrangement of lowercase English characters and a list of words (each consisting of
lowercase English characters too), with the goal of finding as many words from the list as possible in
the arrangement of letters.

However, little Elisa thinks of word search puzzles in a more relaxed way: she considers a word w
to occur in a rectangular arrangement of letters if she can find any permutation of w in the rectangular
arrangement (horizontal, vertical or diagonally).

Since little Elisa is a bit of an anarchist and women always get the last word in every argument,
her parents and friends have designed some word search puzzles so that Elisa can have fun her own
way. They are asking for help in checking if Elisas solutions are correct. Can you help?
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of a test case contains three-blank separated
integers R,C,W (1  R,C,W  100) denoting the number of rows R and columns C of the rectangular
arrangement of characters, and the number of words W to search for in the game. Each of the following
R lines consists of exactly C lowercase English characters. Then, the next W lines describe the list of
words to search for in the arrangement of characters. Each of these lines contains a non-empty sequence
of at most 100 lowercase English characters.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the maximum number of words from the given list of W words that appear,
according to Elisas rules, in the rectangular arrangement of R C-characters.

```
