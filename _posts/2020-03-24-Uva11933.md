title: Uva 11933  Splitting Numbers
---


## Input

```
We define the operation of splitting a binary
number n into two numbers a(n), b(n) as fol-
lows. Let 0  i1 < i2 < . . . < ik be the indices
of the bits (with the least significant bit having
index 0) in n that are 1. Then the indices of
the bits of a(n) that are 1 are i1, i3, i5, . . . and
the indices of the bits of b(n) that are 1 are
i2, i4, i6, . . .

For example, if n is 110110101 in binary
then, again in binary, we have a = 010010001
and b = 100100100.
```

## Output

```
Each test case consists of a single integer n be-
tween 1 and 231  1 written in standard decimal (base 10) format on a single line. Input is terminated
by a line containing 0 which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output for each test case consists of a single line, containing the integers a(n) and b(n) separated
by a single space. Both a(n) and b(n) should be written in decimal format.

## Sample Output
