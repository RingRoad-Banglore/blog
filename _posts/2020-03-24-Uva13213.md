title: Uva 13213  Quidditch Match
---


```
Quidditch is the most popular sport among the students of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Quidditch is played between two teams of N players each, in an oval or rectangular stadium (This season,
the oval stadium is under repair, and therefore all the matchs are played always in the rectangular one).

If you know Harry Potter, you may know a lot of things about this game: its rules, its punctuation
system, the positions of the players and that while Harry is on the ground, his team Gryffindor will
win to Slytherin (come on, we all know that Harry always defeats Malfoy).

Madame Hooch is the flight instructor and Quidditch referee in Hogwarts. Although she admires
Harrys skills in Quidditch she is tired of seeing him win always. For this reason, she has decided to
create an alternative system of punctuation, in which at least on some occasions, Slytherin could win
Gryffindor.

The game as it is well know ends when the seeker catchs the snitch. In that moment, Madame
Hooch registers the position of each player on the plane of the stadium (Although the players compete
flying over their brooms, in the scheme of Madame Hooch the height to which they fly is despised and
only takes into account their location in the plane in two dimensions).

In the Madame Hoochs system, the team who dominates the most part of the field when the match
ends wins the game. She consider that all the players fly at the same speed and therefore, each player
dominates the region that surround him and which has all the points of the field that are most close
to him than to any other player, because flying at the same speed, he could reach to any point of his
region before any other player.

Under this idea, the 2D map of the field is divided into 2N regions, one for each player. Then
Madame Hooch sums the area of the regions belonging to each team, declaring winner to that team
that dominates the greater area of the Quidditch stadium.

However, doing this calculation is really tedious, and since Madame Hooch has not found an spell
that calculates the winner, she has decided to appeal to muggle programming. Can you help her?

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T , the number of test cases.

Each case begins with a line with 4 integers X0, Y0, Xf and Yf (0  X0, Y0, Xf , Yf  100; X0+2 
Xf , and Y0+2  Yf ), the coordinates of the lower left point and the upper right point in the Cartesian
plane. The next line contains an integer N (1  N  10), the number of players of each team. Following
there are N lines with the integers x and y (X0 < x < Xf and Y0 < y < Yf ), the coordinates of each
Gryffindors player. Then N more lines come, with two integers x and y each (X0 < x < Xf and
Y0 < y < Yf ), the coordinates of each Slytherins player.

All the coordinates given are integers values. However, keep in mind that the regions defined for
each player may have decimal vertices.

## Output
