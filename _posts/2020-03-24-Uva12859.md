title: Uva 12859  Fence the vegetables
---


## Input

```text
At the early age of 40, Alice and Bob decided to retire. After more than two decades working as
examples for networking protocols, game theoretical books and several other texts, they were tired. To
remain active, they decided to go into gardening.

Alice and Bob planted several vegetable plants in a huge field. After finishing, they realized that
their plants needed protection from wild animals, so they decided to build a fence around them.

The field is represented as the XY plane, and each vegetable plant as a different point in it. A fence
is represented as a polygon in the plane. However, not every polygon is a valid fence. The fence needs
to be a single simple polygon with each of its sides parallel to one of the axes. Of course, the polygon
must contain all the points representing vegetable plants. A fence too close to the plants or to itself
could make it difficult to walk around, so each side of the polygon needs to be at least 1 millimeter
away from all plants and all non-adjacent sides.

Among all valid fences, Alice and Bob decided to build the one with minimum perimeter, in order
to save on fence material. If there are several valid fences with minimum perimeter, they want to build
one with minimum area among those, to save time when watering their garden.

In the following pictures, several different fences are shown in a field with four vegetable plants
represented as circles.

Luckily, Alice and Bobs background of participating in rigorous scientific projects made them very
thorough with their records: they know the exact location of their plants with millimeter precision.
Using this data, help them calculate the perimeter and area of an optimal fence.

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases; each test case is formatted as follows. The first line contains an
integer V (1  V  105) representing the number of vegetable plants in Alice and Bobs field. Each
of the next V lines describes a different vegetable plant with two integers X and Y (1  X,Y  108),
indicating the coordinates of the plant, in millimeters. No two plants have the same location.

perimeter in millimeters and the area in squared millimeters of the fence that Alice and Bob want to
build.
