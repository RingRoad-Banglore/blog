D: Dominoes Magic Squares
Source file name: dominoes.c, dominoes.cpp, dominoes.java, or dominoes.py

Author: Rodrigo Cardoso

A domino set is a collection of tiles of the form
[a | b]

with integer labels a and b satisfying 0  a, b  6. Both [a | b] and [b | a] are descriptions of the same domino
tile. A complete domino set has exactly 28 tiles and the sum of all its labels is 168.

A magic square is a square of integer numbers whose rows, columns, and diagonals have the same sum. Since
domino tiles can be seen as planar objects of 2 unit squares, they can be used to build magic squares. For
instance, the set of domino tiles

[1 | 4] , [5 | 2] , [4 | 4] , [2 | 3] , [5 | 4] , [5 | 3] , [1 | 3] , [3 | 3]

can be arranged into a magic square of side 4 units with rows, columns, and diagonals adding up to 13:

However, it is impossible to build a 4  4 magic square with the following set of titles adding up to 15 in rows,
columns, and diagonals:

[6 | 5] , [2 | 4] , [2 | 2] , [5 | 5] , [5 | 4] , [5 | 1] , [2 | 3] , [3 | 6] .

Assume you are given 8 domino tiles: can you arrange them into a 4  4 magic square?
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. A test case comprises 8 consecutive lines of input, each one containing
two blank-separated integers a and b, 0  a, b  6, representing the tile [a | b]. You can assume that a test case
does not contain repeated dominoes.

The input must be read from standard input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line with the unique character Y if a magic square can be built with the given
domino tiles and N otherwise.

The output must be written to standard output.
