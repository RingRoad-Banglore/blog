title: Uva 10632  Pyramid
---


```
In a classical computer game, a creature jumps around on
the cells in a pyramid much like the one in the picture below.
The creature can jump to the cells directly above him or
below him. Jumping outside the pyramid is of course not
allowed.

When the creature lands on a cell, it changes color: from
red to green, green to blue or blue to red. Given how the
cells are initially colored, determine a jumping sequence
containing no more than 5000 jumps that turns all the cells
into blue. You are allowed to start from any cell in the
pyramid you want (this guarantees that there will always
be a solution). The first cell to change color is the one
reached after jumping from the start cell.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases (at most 50). Each test case begins with a line containing a single
integer n (2  n  40), the height of the pyramid. The next n lines describe the start configuration of
the pyramid using the upper case letters R, G and B. The pyramid is described in row major order,
each row from left to right; see the sample input for the exact format (the first sample input corresponds
to the pyramid in the picture). At least one cell in the pyramid is not blue in the start configuration.

The input ends with a case where n is 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output two lines. The first line should contain two integers, the creatures start
position in the pyramid. The first integer is the row (1 being the top row) and the second integer is
the cell in that row (1 being the leftmost cell). The next line should contain a string describing the
jumps. The length of this string should be at most 5000 characters. Each character should either be a
7 (jumping up-left), a 9 (up-right), a 1 (down-left) or a 3 (down-right). Any solution that has no
more than 5000 jumps and which turns all cells into blue will be accepted.
