title: Uva 01270  Paint the Map
---


```

Tom was empolyed by the worlds most famous Map Publishing Press. They do the boring work of
painting the maps. Assign limited color to different countries without adjacent countries share the same
color. Despite the mathematicians have proved that four color is enough, finding out a proper 4-color
solution in limited time for some map with great complexity is almost impossible. So they are allowed
to use five color: Blue, Green, Pink, Red and Yellow. Although it is not very difficult now, Tom want
to be completely free from this task. He want a computer to do this for him. But the problem is that
he knows nothing about programing, then he ask you for help.

Your task is to write a program which generate proper solution correspoding to each map description.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several map descriptions. Each description have a # at the end. In each description,
there are arbitary number of lines. Each line consists of two parts: the first part is a single string which
denotes a country; the second part consists of several strings denoting a list of its adjacent countries.
i.e :

China Mongolia Russia

This line says that China is neighboured by Mongolia and Russia. You should choose proper color
for each country. No adjacent countries should have same color. There is an END at the end of the
input file.

Note: The name of countries consists of up to 20 characters without seperating spaces. There will
be up to 500 countries in each description and no country named END. countries are seperated from
another by one or more spaces.

```

## Output

```
For each map in the input, first print the number of the map, as shown in the sample output, followed
by your solution. One line for each country, consists of the name of the country and the color you
selected. Multiple lines should be sorted in lexicographical order. Any solution satisfied the above
requirement is acceptable.

If there are no possible solution, print Impossible.
Output a blank line after each test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
China Mongolia Russia

Russia Mongolia

#

END

```

## Sample Output

```

Map #1

China Red

Mongolia Green

Russia Pink
```
