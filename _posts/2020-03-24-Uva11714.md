## Input

```
I am a polar bear. But I am not just an ordinary polar bear. Yes I am extra ordinary! I love to play
with numbers. One day my very good friend Mr. Panda came to me, and challenged me to solve a
puzzle. He blindfolded me, and said that I have n distinct numbers. What I can ask is whether a-th
number is larger than b-th number and he will answer me properly. What I have to do is to find out the
largest and second largest number. I thought for a while and said Come on, I will do it in minimum
number of comparison.
```

## Output
