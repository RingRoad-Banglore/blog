title: Uva 11481  Arrange the Numbers
---


## Input

```text

Consider this sequence {1, 2, 3, . . . , N}, as a initial sequence of first N natural numbers. You can
rearrange this sequence in many ways. There will be N ! different arrangements. You have to calculate
the number of arrangement of first N natural numbers, where in first M (M  N) positions, exactly
K (K  M) numbers are in its initial position.

Example:
For, N = 5, M = 3, K = 2

You should count this arrangement {1, 4, 3, 2, 5}, here in first 3 positions 1 is in 1-st position and
3 in 3-rd position. So exactly 2 of its first 3 are in there initial position.

But you should not count this {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input is an integer T (T  1000) that indicates the number of test cases. Next T line
contains 3 integers each, N (1  N  1000), M , and K.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output the case number, followed by the answer modulo 1000000007. Look at the sample
for clarification.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1

5 3 2

```
