title: Uva 12407  Speed Zones
---


```
Suppose you are in a 2-Dimensional world. Now, you are in a system of N parallel zones of same or
different speed, numbered from 0 to N  1. In each zone you can move in some given constant speed
(Si amount per second in i-th zone) at any direction. Each zone is parallel to X axis, starting from the
X axis (and then on the positive X and positive Y part only). Width of each zone is 100 (along the Y
axis).

You are currently in the origin (0, 0). You need to reach (100 N,D) coordinate. But, you want to
do that in minimum possible time (seconds).

Here is an example with N = 4, and D = 350. The arrows show a possible path from (0, 0) to
(400, 350). Note that after the end of each zone (except the last one), it is possible that you may be in
an non-integer X coordinate.

Given N , D, and the speeds S0, S1, S2, , SN1 you will need to find the minimum possible time
in seconds to reach the destination point.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 50), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case contains two lines. In the first line you will be given two integers N (1  N  100) and
D (0  D  10000). In the second line you will be given N integers, the speeds, in the order: S0, S1,
S2, , SN1. For all 0  i < N , 1  Si  1000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, generate one line of output, in the format Case < caseno >: < answer >. Here
< case  no > is the case number starting from 1, and < answer > is the minimum possible time in

seconds. Your output should not differ more than 106 = 0.000001. You should print at least 8 digits
after the decimal point for < answer >.
