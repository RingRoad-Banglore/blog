## Input

```text

Batman, the superhero, has difficult days fighting villains, and today is one of these days. Batman
begins the day checking the list of superpowers that he can use to beat the enemies of Gotham City,
and the list of villains that he has to beat during the day.

Each superpower has a name, an attack factor and an energy consumption in calories. Each villain
has an alias, a defense factor, and the list of the names of the superpowers that can affect him. To
beat a specific villain, Batman must attack him with a superpower that can affect the villain and whose
attack factor is greater or equal than the defense factor of the villain. Besides, Batman must use the
powers of his list in order (possibly skipping some powers) and have to beat all the villains in the same
order of the list. Like everybody else, Batman doesnt have unlimited energy . . . he can only spend
maximum E calories per day.

Given a list of superpowers and a list of villains, is it possible that Batman beats them all without
spending more than E calories?

Batman can spend per day.

 P lines, one per superpower, containing the following information separated by spaces:

 An alphanumeric string s with the name of the superpower (case sensitive, without spaces).

 An integer a (0  a  10000) specifying the attack factor of the superpower.
 An integer c (0  c  100000) specifying the energy consumption in calories of the super-

power.

 V lines, one per villain, containing the following information separated by spaces:

 An alphanumeric string s with the alias of the villain (case sensitive, without spaces).

 An integer d (0  d  10000) specifying the defense factor of the villain.
 A list with the names of the superpowers that can affect the villain, separated with commas.

The list will not contain repeated names.

The end of the input is specified by a line with the string 0 0 0.

Suppose that the superpowers have distinct names and that the villains have distinct aliases.
