title: Uva 11258  String Partition
---


```
John was absurdly busy for preparing a programming contest recently. He wanted to create a ridicu-
lously easy problem for the contest. His problem was not only easy, but also boring: Given a list of
non-negative integers, what is the sum of them?

However, he made a very typical mistake when he wrote a program to generate the input data for
his problem. He forgot to print out spaces to separate the list of integers. John quickly realized his
mistake after looking at the generated input file because each line is simply a string of digits instead of
a list of integers.

He then got a better idea to make his problem a little more interesting: There are many ways to
split a string of digits into a list of non-zero-leading (0 itself is allowed) 32-bit signed integers. What is
the maximum sum of the resultant integers if the string is split appropriately?
```

## Input

```
The input begins with an integer N ( 500) which indicates the number of test cases followed. Each
of the following test cases consists of a string of at most 200 digits.

```

## Output

```
For each input, print out required answer in a single line.

```
