title: Uva 12911  Subset sum
---


```
Given a set s of integers, your task is to determine how many different non-empty subsets sum up to a
target value.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case is a line containing two integers
N and T , the number of items of the original set of integers and the target value. After that comes one
line with the N integers si that belong to the original set s.

 1  N  40

 109  T, si  109

```

## Output

```
For each test case print on a single line an integer indicating the number of different non-empty subsets
that sum up to the target value T .

Explication:
On the first test case the target is 0 and the following are the valid subsets: (2, 4, -1, -5), (2, 6, -5,

-3), (4, -1, -3), (6, -5, -1).
On the second test case the target is again 0, the only valid subset is: (-3, -2, 5)

```

## Sample Input

```
6 0
-1 2 -3 4 -5 6
5 0
-7 -3 -2 5 8

```

## Sample Output

```
4
1
```
