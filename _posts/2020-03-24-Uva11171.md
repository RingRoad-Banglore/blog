When typing SMS messages on a mobile phone, each of the ten
digit buttons represent several alphabetic characters. On my phone
(an ancient Ericsson T65, in case anyone was wondering), I have the
following mapping (1 is used for space, and 0 for some common non-
alphabetic symbols):

2  ABC, 3  DEF, 4  GHI, 5  JKL, 6  MNO, 7  PQRS,
8  TUV, 9  WXYZ

As youve probably experienced, this makes the typing quite cum-
bersome. The phones usually try to compensate this by making use of
a dictionary basically, the idea is that there will typically be relatively
few actual words having the same button combination. The way this
works is that when you have typed a certain digit sequence, you can cy-
cle through the words in the dictionary that map to this digit sequence
using the up and down buttons. Pressing up gives you the next
word, and pressing down gives you the previous word. Words are
ordered by how common they are, most common words first and least common words last. This wraps,
so that pressing up at the last word gives you the first word and similarly for down. Initially after
having pressed a digit sequence, you will get the first (most common) word that maps to this sequence.

This usually works quite well, but if youre trying to type a word that does not exist in the dictionary,
you have to write it by separating it into several parts, where each part is a word in the dictionary. In
order to start writing a new part, you have to press the right button on the keypad.

Obviously, the number of keys needed to type a word depends on how (and if) we divide it into
parts. Now, I would like to know how to type a word (that may or may not be from the dictionary)
using as few key presses as possible (its not that Im lazy, I just want to decrease the wear and tear of
my keypad).
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several data sets (at most 5), terminated by a line containing a single 0.

Each data set begins with an integer 1  N  10000 giving the size of the dictionary, followed by
N lines, giving the words of the dictionary from most common to least common. Words consist solely
of lower case a-z and are at most 10 characters long.

Then follows an integer Q  1 giving the number of words to type. This is followed by Q lines, each
containing a nonempty word to type. It will always be possible to type the given words using the given
dictionary. The total length of all Q words to type will be at most 250000.

```

## Output

```
For each query, output a line containing any optimal keypress solution in the following format.

 For pressing any of the digits 2-9, simply output that digit.

 For pressing right, output R.
