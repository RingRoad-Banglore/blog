title: Uva 12053  Unbreakable Floor
---


## Input

```text
Alan bought a new house. He likes rectangles, so he wants his floor full of identical rectangular shapes.
Imagine he has a floor of 5 6, he may fill this floor with rectangles of 1 2 in at least two ways:

Picture (a) shows a breakable layout, since there is a straight line through the whole floor which
divides the floor into two parts  a 5 4 rectangle and a 5 2 rectangle, and all the 1 2 rectangles
are not destroyed.

Picture (b) shows a unbreakable layout, since you cannot divide it into two parts without destroying
any 1 2 rectangle.

Alan likes unbreakable floorings, but hes not sure if it is possible for any size of floor and rectangle
shape. Can you tell him?
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains the number of tests t (1  t  40). Each case consists of a single line with four
positive integers p, q, a, b (1  p, q, a, b  10000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number first. Then print the word Yes if it is possible to make a
unbreakable floor of a b with rectangles of p q, otherwise print the word No. Answer for each case
should be in exactly one line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
1 2 5 6
1 2 3 17
2 3 11 18

```
