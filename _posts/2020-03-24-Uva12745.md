title: Uva 12745  Wishmaster
---


## Input

```text

Wishmaster, the demonic jinn is back to the city of Byteland to fulfill wishes of all the people in the
city. As people of Byteland are patriot, they want Wishmaster to do something for their country.
They want a remedy of the traffic jam of the city so they can participate in Codejam timely every
year. Coincidentally, Wishmaster has N magical powers and Byteland also has N (1 to N) route.
Wishmaster can convert a magical power into anything he wants. There are M person in the city.
Everyone in city will make exactly two wishes to Wishmaster. A wish will be to build a flyover over
the route i (1  i  N) or to build a subway below the route i (1  i  N). Wishmaster will build
either a subway or a flyover, but not both, in a route with a magical power.

If Wishmaster fulfills both wishes of at least one person then he will become an angel. But, as he
is still a demonic jinn, he is planning to remain demonic and wants to find a way not to fulfill both
wishes of any person.

Given wishes of M persons, help Wishmaster to determine whether he can avoid fulfilling both
wishes of any of them. Note that he must build a flyover or subway but not both on each route.
```
