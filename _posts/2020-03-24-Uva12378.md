title: Uva 12378  Ball Blasting Game
---


## Input

```
Morteza is playing a ball blasting game. In this game there is a chain of different colored balls. He is
expected to explode as many balls as possible by aligning same-colored balls and making a sequence of
them. To align balls, he can aim and shoot a new ball into a position in the chain, thus adding it there.
If the new ball makes a sequence of two or more same-colored balls with its immediate neighbors, then
the sequence blows up breaking the chain up into two parts. The two sections draw together to reform a
single chain. Again, if the colors of the newly aligned balls (on joining ends of the two sections) match,
the entire run of the suit explodes. New explosions ensue as long as joining sections bear new matches.

For instance, consider a chain symbolized in the string GGGBWWRRWRR, with each letter representing
the color of the corresponding ball in the chain. The train of balls therefore is composed of 6 sequences
in 4 colors. Here, a ball can be added in 12 different positions. Shooting a red ball between the two
middle red balls triggers two successive explosions which leave the chain GGGBRR.

Morteza reaches a challenge stage in which he has only one ball to shoot but the color of which
he can choose. He may not advance to the next stage unless he takes a shot that sets off the largest
possible number of explosions. He has to replay all through this repetitive stage should he fail and
needs your help in finding the largest possible number of successive explosions to save him a great deal
of suffering.
