A sample layout of ice floes with 3
penguins on them.

Somewhere near the south pole, a number of penguins are stand-
ing on a number of ice floes. Being social animals, the penguins
would like to get together, all on the same floe. The penguins do
not want to get wet, so they have use their limited jump distance
to get together by jumping from piece to piece. However, tem-
peratures have been high lately, and the floes are showing cracks,
and they get damaged further by the force needed to jump to an-
other floe. Fortunately the penguins are real experts on cracking
ice floes, and know exactly how many times a penguin can jump
off each floe before it disintegrates and disappears. Landing on
an ice floe does not damage it. You have to help the penguins
find all floes where they can meet.

## Input

```
On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at
most 100. After that per testcase:

 One line with the integer N (1  N  100) and a floating-point number D (0  D  100000),
denoting the number of ice pieces and the maximum distance a penguin can jump.

 N lines, each line containing xi, yi, ni and mi, denoting for each ice piece its X and Y coordinate,
the number of penguins on it and the maximum number of times a penguin can jump off this
piece before it disappears (10000  xi, yi  10000, 0  ni  10, 1  mi  200).

```

## Output

```
Per testcase:

 One line containing a space-separated list of 0-based indices of the pieces on which all penguins
can meet. If no such piece exists, output a line with the single number -1.
