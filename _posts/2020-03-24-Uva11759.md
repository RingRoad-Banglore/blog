## Input

```

Figure 1: A fence plan. The steel fences are drawn
with gray lines and the wooden fences are drawn

with brown dashed lines. This figure corresponds to
the first sample input and output.

The Indigenous Barrier Makers (IBM) are out
in the jungle of the Amazon to make fences
for the people living there. Many new inhabi-
tants are coming to stay there so IBM has to
build many fences. But all the fences are not
of the same type; there are some wooden fences
and some steel fences. And the cost of making
the steel fence is much higher than the wooden
fence. So IBM wants to build wooden fence
whenever it is possible to minimize the total
cost. But ACM (Association of Consumer-right
Monitoring) is more than concerned about the
safety of the people and about saving trees.

With the adverse effect of climate change
around the world, wild fire is a common threat
now, so wooden fence is sometimes very risky in
places like Amazon. Also make wooden fence
we need a lot of woods which eventually de-
stroys a lot of trees. Therefore fences are built
in layers for the inhabitants for better protec-
tion, safety and privacy. To stay safe as well as
to save cost, ACM and IBM decides to build the
outermost fence with steel and then a wooden
fence and steel fence alternately inwards. Fig-
ure 1 shows the top view of such a fence lay-
out. The grey lines indicate that steel fence will
be built by IBM along those lines. The brown
dashed lines indicate that wooden fences will
be built along those lines. Given a fence lay-
out, you will have to help ACM and IBM to
find out the total cost for building fences by writing a program. Your solution must be quite efficient.

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 12 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:

The first line of each set is an integer N (0 < N < 501) which denotes how many fences are to be
built. Each of the next N lines describes a fence ring. Each fence ring is described as a complete convex
polygon. The description starts with an integer M (0 < M < 1001) which denotes the total number of
wall segments that make up the fence ring. This M is followed by M pairs of floating-point numbers
(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), , (xM , yM ). These integers denote that the fence is made by connecting the
points (x1, y1) with (x2, y2), (x2, y2) with (x3, y3), , (xM1, yM1) with (xM , yM ) and (xM , yM ) with
(x1, y1).

You can assume that the fence layout will be a valid one  (a) two fence rings will not intersect
(b) fence rings will always be described as a convex polygon. You cam also assume that absolute value
of all the coordinates will be less than 400000.

Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce 5 lines of output.

The first line contains the serial of output.
The next line reports the total number of communities. A community is comprised by people who

share a common outermost boundary.
The third line contains the string Total Cost:
The fourth and fifth line reports the total cost to build the steel fence and wooden fence respectively.

The cost has to be reported million Yuan rounded to the eight digits after the decimal. Assume that
the cost of building steel fence is 100 Yuan/unit length and that for Wooden fence is 50 Yuan/unit
length.

Print a blank line after output for each set of input. Look at the output for sample input for details.
Output difference due to small precision error will be ignored.
