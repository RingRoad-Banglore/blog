```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer, t, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case,
three lines appear, the first one contains a number n, 100  n  2500, representing the minimun amount
of calories we want to eat (n is multiple of 10). The second line contains a number p, 5  p  100,
representing the number of courses we have. The third line of each test case contains p numbers,
representing the amount of calories of the p courses (these p numbers are larger or equal to 50, smaller
or equal to 2500, and multiple of 10).

```
