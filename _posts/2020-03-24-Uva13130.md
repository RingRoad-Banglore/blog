title: Uva 13130  Cacho
---


## Input

```text
In Bolivia there is a very popular game called Cacho. The game consists rolling five dices (a1, a2, a3,
a4, a5) and then annotate the result according to certain rules. This time we will focus on one case in
particular: escala. A escala is the scene in which the dices form a sequence of consecutive numbers.
More formally a escala meets the property:

ai + 1 = ai+1, 1  i  4

There are two types of escala: a ordinary escala (it satisfy the property described above), and
a Escala Real (when the scenery is 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. In the game this case is also a valid scala).

Cael is a boy who is learning to play and wants you to help develop a program to check when five
dices are forming a escala. Note that the Escala Real is not a valid escala for Cael.

## Output

```text
The input begins with a number T  100, the number of test cases. Below are T lines, each with five
numbers ai (1  ai  6) in no-decreasing order.

```

## Sample Input

```text
In each case, if the five dices form a scale print in one line Y. Otherwise print in one line N (quotes
for clarity).

```

## Sample Output

```text
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
1 4 4 4 5
1 3 4 5 6
1 2 2 3 6

```
