title: Uva 12637  30 Minutes or Less
---


## Input

```

Gridland is a grid-shaped city whose streets are numbered consecutively starting at 1, from left to right
and from south to north. The distance between two city locations (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is the usual
Manhattan distance, i.e., |x2x1|+ |y2 y1|. Pizza Planet, the largest fast food chain in Gridland and
the franchise with most restaurants across the city, plans to implement the 30 minutes or less guarantee
in its delivery service: either customers receive their pizzas within 30 minutes after placing the order
or otherwise the pizza order is on the house.

Your task is to reduce the pizza delivery times, i.e., to minimize the total distance delivery guys
from Pizza Planet restaurants must travel to make all deliveries. Each pizza order must be delivered
and each restaurant can dispatch at most one pizza order.
```

## Output

```
There are several test cases. Each case begins with a blank-separated pair of integer numbers R and N :
the number of restaurants (1  R  100) and the number of pizza orders (1  N  R). Then R +N
lines of blank-separated pairs of integers x and y follow (103  x  103, 103  y  103): each of the
first R lines indicates the location of a Pizza Planet restaurant and each of the last N lines indicates
the location where a pizza order must be delivered.
