title: Uva 10973  Triangle Counting
---


## Input

```
Having a simple undirected graph G = (V,E), a triangle is defined as a triple (v1, v2, v3) where
v1, v2, v3  V and (v1, v2)  E for all 1  i, j  3 and i = j. In this problem, you are given an
undirected graph and asked to count all the triangles in this graph. You are assured that there is no
edge in this graph that is the member of more than 2 triangles.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains an integer T  250, which is the number of test cases. Each test case
begins with a line containing two integers 1  n  3000 and m which are the number of vertices and
the number of edges in the graph respectively. The next m lines contain two integers 1  i,j  3000
indicating that there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j.

Tip for C++ Programmers: Any attempt to use ifstream to read the input will exceed the time
limit for this problem. Use scanf instead.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output for each test case consists of one line containing the number of triangles in the specified graph
of the test case.
