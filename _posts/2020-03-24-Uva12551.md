## Input

```text

You are a successful business man who uses to invest some money in the shares market. As a successful
man you manage a network of well prepared assistants that can assure you the values of the shares
for the next day. Each day you have a capital that you can spend in the market according to your
assistants suggestions. In addition, you can only buy packs of shares from several salesmen.

Your goal is to select which packs should be bought in order to maximize the profits without
exceeding the amount of capital you have. Obviously, you can buy each pack only once.
```

## Output

```text
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive
test cases are separated by a single blank line.

The first line contains the maximum capital C that you can invest (0 < C  230). The next line has
two integers, the number of total shares N (0 < N  500) and the number of packs P (0 < P  50000).
Each one of the following N lines describe the N shares. Each line contains two integers ai and ti
representing the current price and the expected price for the next day of the ith share (1  i  N),
respectively. Finally, the following P lines contain the information of the packs, one per line. For each
line, the first integer R represents the number of different shares that contains this pack. Then for each
share type you have two integers sj and qj (1  j  R), where sj is the id of the jth share and qj is
the quantity of the jth share in this pack.

```
