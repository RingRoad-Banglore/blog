title: Uva 10563  Least Squares
---


## Input

```
You are given an irregularly-shaped area on a grid that you must cover completely with non-overlapping
squares of various sizes. Doing this optimally (with the fewest number of squares) is difficult. Very
difficult. Way too difficult for your limited intelligence. So I wontask. Why waste your time and mine?

Instead, your much simpler task is merely to cover it with squares. Thats it. Do you think you can
handle that? I have some crayons you can use. (Squares will be coloured by filling them with capital
letters, A to Z)

Oh, make sure that no touching squares have the same colour, so we can tell them apart. (Touching
means sharing part of an edge; corners dont count)

Oh yes, and Id appreciate it if youd give me the lexicographically first configuration that satisfies
this property. For simplicitys sake. (In other words, if every row of the solved grid is concatenated
into one string, give me the solution whose string would come first in a dictionary)
```

## Output

```
Every case consists of a grid to fill with squares. The first line will contain m (0 < m  100), the
number of rows in the grid, and n (0 < n  80), the number of columns. The remaining m lines will
consist of a drawing of the area. A ? represents a portion of the area to be filled, while a . represents
a boundary section of the grid that you should ignore.

There will be at most 100 cases. The last case will be followed by a line with two 0s.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the desired coloured solution, in grid format. Separate the output of consecutive
cases with a blank line.
