title: Uva 12092  Paint the Roads
---


```

In a country there are n cities con-
nected by m one way roads. You
can paint any of these roads. To
paint a road it costs d unit of money
where d is the length of that road.
Your task is to paint some of the
roads so that the painted roads can
be partitioned into some disjoint
cycles such that every vertex ap-
pears in exactly k of these disjoint
cycles. But you have to minimize
the costs of painting these roads.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input contains T
the number of test case. Then fol-
lowing lines contains T Test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing 3 integers n (1  n  40), m (1  m  2000) and k (1  k
and 1  k  n  100). Next m lines contain description of m roads. Each line contains three integers
f , t (0  f, t < n and f = t) and d (0  d < 100). That means there is a road of d length from city f
to city t. You can assume that there will be at most one road in one direction between two cities.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output contains 1 integer denoting the minimum unit of money needed to paint roads.
In the case it is impossible to paint the roads maintaining the constraints output -1.
