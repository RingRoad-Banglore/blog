```
A spelling suggestion is a part of spelling correction program that generates a set of plausible re-
placements for words that are likely to be misspelled. One way to measure the plausibility of these
replacements is to compute their edit distance against a given misspelled word. The edit distance be-
tween two words is the total number of edit operations that have to be done in order to transform one
word into the other. Normally these edit operations are insertion, deletion and substitution of a single
character including transposition of 2 consecutive characters.

For example, for a word wonder, if the deletion is applied at the character o, this word will
transform into wnder. And if the substitution with a is applied at o, it will become wander. And
if the transposition is applied at er, it will become wondre.

In this edit distance strategy, the degree of similarity between two words is up to their minimum edit
distance. If the minimum edit distance between word1 and word2 is lower than the distance between
word1 and word3, then word1 is more similar to word2 than to word3. So the word2 is a better spelling
suggestion for word1, comparing with word3.

Suppose that you are an employee of a software company which needs to build up a prototype
of spelling suggestion program. This prototype tends to be a part of word processing software. The
requirement is that it has to use the edit distance strategy for their spelling suggestion. But the
substitution operation has to be redefined to match the behavior of mistyping. The cost of substitution
of a character with another character depends on the position of them on the keyboard layout. If they
are close to each other, the cost is only half of the normal one. For this purpose, the substitution is
categorized into near-substitution and far-substitution. Their costs are defined as 1 and 2 respectively.
And the costs for insertion, deletion and transposition are 2. In addition, this program must run fast
enough to pass the time limit that is set by your manager. By the way for this prototype, an English
QWERTY keyboard layout is chosen to be used.

Goal
To generate optimum spelling suggestions for each input word, where each optimum spelling sug-

gestion is a word in dictionary that has the least minimum edit distance from the given input word.
The time limit for 5,000 misspelled words is less than or equal to 5 minutes.
```

## Input

```
Input is a standard input which contains 3 parts of data. Each of these three parts ends with a blank
line.

 The first part is a set of near-substitution rules, where each rule is kept in one line. Each line has
two fields. Each filed is separated by a space. The total no. of rules is less than or equal to 150

 The first field is a character where it can be near-substituted with other characters.
 The second field is a sequence of characters which can be near-substituted for the character

in the previous field. There is no space in this field.
 The characters that may be contained in this part are characters that can be typed in using a

generic English keyboard layout, which are alpha-numeric characters and some punctuations
without space or tab. They are listed as the following.

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789`~!@#$%^&*()-_=+\|[{]};:'",<.>/?

 The second part is a sequence of words in dictionary, where each word is kept in one line. The
total no. of words is less than or equal to 150,000.

 The characters in dictionary are alphabetical characters with an apostrophe punctuation.
* abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

 The third part is a sequence of words that need to be checked for their spellings. Each of these
words is also kept in one line. The total no. of words is less than or equal to 5,000.

 The characters that may be contained in this part are the same as characters in the first
part, which are alpha-numeric characters and some punctuation. (See the first part.)

 Since each of these three parts end with a blank line, the third blank line is the termination of
the input.

```

## Output

```
For each word in the third part, write a line which contains 3 parts of information, separated with a
colon.

 The first part is the given input word.

 The second part is the minimum edit distance between the input word and suggestion word(s).

 The third part is an ascending sorted sequence of suggestion word(s), separated with a space.
There is no space left after the last word.

More Explanations:
In this sample input, there are 5 near-substitution rules (line no. 1-5), 10 words in dictionary (line

no. 7-16) and 12 words looking for their suggestions (line no. 18-29).
In the sample output, there are 12 lines for each corresponding 12 words from the input.
For the 1st word, the minimum edit distance between x and its suggestions (A B Z a b) is 2. All

of them are the (far) substitution costs.
For the 2-nd word, the minimum edit distance between s and its suggestion (a) is 1, which is a

near-substitution cost, guided by the 1st substitution rule.
For the 3rd word, the minimum edit distance between z and its suggestion (A Z a) are 1, which is

a near-substitution cost, guided by the 1st or 5th substitution rule.
For the 4th word, the minimum edit distance is 4, which are summed from one far-substitution cost

and one deletion cost.
For the 5th word, the minimum edit distance is 6. The costs between xxx and (A B Z a b) are from

two deletion and one far-substitution costs. The cost between xxx and ABC re from three far-substitution
costs.

For the 6th word, the cost between angre and anger is from one transposition costs. The costs
between angre and (angle angry) are from one far-substitution costs.

For the 7th word and 8th word, seem to be similar. But the cost of 7th word is from one far-
substitution costs. But the cost between angrt and anger is from 2 near-substitution costs (r substitutes
with e and t substitutes with r) according to the near-substitution rule no. 4.

For the 9th word, the word is exactly matched within dictionary. So the cost is 0.
For the 10th and 11th words, each cost is from one transposition costs.
For the 12th words, the cost between CAB and (A B) is from two deletion costs. The cost between

CAB and (ABC) is from one deletion and one insertion costs. Please be notify that it is not from 2
transpositions of CAB to ACB and then ACB to ABC.
