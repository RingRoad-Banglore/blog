title: Uva 10379  Pit Stop Strategy
---


## Input

```text
The speed of a racing car, all other factors being equal, depends on the amount of fuel it carries.
In general, the weight of the fuel slows the car. In addition, the weight of the fuel increases fuel
consumption. It is therefore an advantage to carry as little fuel as possible. Any amount of fuel may
be loaded at the beginning of the race, and refueling pit stops may be made during the race. The
time consumed for the pit stop increases with the amount of fuel loaded. Your task is to determine
the optimal fueling and pit stop strategy for each of a number of cars, based on measurements taken
immediately before the race.
```

## Output

```text
Standard input consists of several lines of input, each containing:

 the number of laps in the race (integer less than or equal to 100)

 the theoretical lap time [seconds] of the car on an empty tank (float)

 the increase in lap time [seconds] per litre of fuel carried at the beginning of the lap (float)

 the theoretical fuel consumption [litres per lap] on an empty tank (float)

 the increase in fuel consumption per litre of fuel carried at the beginning of the lap (float; strictly
less than 1)

 the time [seconds] for a pit stop taking on no fuel (float)

 the extra pit stop time per litre of fuel loaded (float)

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input line, print the following information

 one line containing the seven input numbers in order

 one line containing three integers:

1. total race time
2. the amount of fuel to be loaded initially
3. the number of pit stops

 for each pit stop, a line containing:

1. the number of laps completed since the start of the race at the time of the pit stop
2. the amount of fuel to be taken on

All floating point results should be printed to 3 decimal places. All numbers on a single line should
be separated by a single space.
