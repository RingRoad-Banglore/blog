title: Uva 11324  The Largest Clique
---


## Input

```
Given a directed graph G, consider the
following transformation. First, create a
new graph T(G) to have the same vertex
set as G. Create a directed edge between
two vertices u and v in T(G) if and only if
there is a path between u and v in G that
follows the directed edges only in the for-
ward direction. This graph T(G) is often
called the transitive closure of G.

We define a clique in a directed graph
as a set of vertices U such that for any two
vertices u and v in U, there is a directed
edge either from u to v or from v to u (or
both). The size of a clique is the number
of vertices in the clique.
```

## Output

```
The number of cases is given on the first line of input. Each test case describes a graph G. It begins with
a line of two integers n and m, where 0  n  1000 is the number of vertices of G and 0  m  50, 000
is the number of directed edges of G. The vertices of G are numbered from 1 to n. The following m
lines contain two distinct integers u and v between 1 and n which define a directed edge from u to v in
G.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single integer that is the size of the largest clique in T(G).
