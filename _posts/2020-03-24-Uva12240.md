title: Uva 12240  Cocircular Points
---


## Input

```text
You probably know what a set of collinear points is: a set of points such that there exists a straight line
that passes through all of them. A set of cocircular points is defined in the same fashion, but instead
of a straight line, we ask that there is a circle such that every point of the set lies over its perimeter.

The International Collinear Points Centre (ICPC) has assigned you the following task: given a set
of points, calculate the size of the larger subset of cocircular points.
```

## Output

```text
Each test case is given using several lines. The first line contains an integer N representing the number
of points in the set (1  N  100). Each of the next N lines contains two integers X and Y representing
the coordinates of a point of the set (104  X,Y  104). Within each test case, no two points have
the same location.

The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a single line with a single integer representing the number of points in one of
the largest subsets of the input that are cocircular.
