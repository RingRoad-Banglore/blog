```
A palindrome is a string of symbols that
is equal to itself when reversed. Given
an input string, not necessarily a palin-
drome, compute the number of swaps
necessary to transform the string into a
palindrome. By swap we mean revers-
ing the order of two adjacent symbols.
For example, the string mamad may be
transformed into the palindrome madam
with 3 swaps:

 swap ad to yield mamda

 swap md to yield madma

 swap ma to yield madam
```

## Input

```
The first line of input gives n, the number
of test cases. For each test case, one line
of input follows, containing a string of up
to 100 lowercase letters.

```

## Output

```
Output consists of one line per test case.
This line will contain the number of
swaps, or Impossible if it is not pos-
sible to transform the input to a palindrome.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
mamad
asflkj
aabb

```

## Sample Output

```
3
Impossible
2
```
