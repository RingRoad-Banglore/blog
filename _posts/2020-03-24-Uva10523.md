title: Uva 10523  Very Easy 
---


```
Most of the times, the students of Computer Science & Engineering of BUET deal with bogus, tough and
very complex formulae. That is why, sometimes, even for a easy problem they think very hard and make
the problem much complex to solve. But, the team members of the team BUET PESSIMISTIC
are the only exceptions. Just like the opposite manner, they treat every hard problem as easy and so
cannot do well in any contest. Today, they try to solve a series but fail for treating it as hard. Let
them help.
```

## Input

```
Just try to determine the answer for the following series

N
i=1

iAi

You are given the value of integers N and A (1  N  150, 0  A  15).

```

## Output

```
For each line of the input, your correct program should output the integer value of the sum in separate
lines for each pair of values of N and A.

```

## Sample Input

```
3 3
4 4

```

## Sample Output

```
102
1252
```
