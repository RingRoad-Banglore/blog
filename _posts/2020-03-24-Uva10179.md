title: Uva 10179  Irreducible Basic Fractions
---


## Input

```text
A fraction m

n
is basic if 0  m < n and it is irreducible if gcd(m,n) = 1. Given a positive integer n, in

this problem you are required to find out the number of irreducible basic fractions with denominator n.

For example, the set of all basic fractions with denominator 12, before reduction to lowest terms, is

0

## Output

```text
Each line of the input contains a positive integer n (< 1000000000) and the input terminates with a
value 0 for n (do not process this terminating value).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each n in the input print a line containing the number of irreducible basic fractions with denominator
n.

```

## Sample Output

```text
