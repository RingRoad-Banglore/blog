title: Uva 12416  Excessive Space Remover
---


## Input

```text
How do you remove consecutive spaces in a simple editor like notepad in Microsoft Windows? One
way is to repeatedly replace all two consecutive spaces with one space (we call it an action). In this
problem, youre to simulate this process and report the number of such replace all actions.

For example, if you want to remove consecutive spaces in A very big joke., you need two
actions:
``Averybigjoke.'' -> ``Averybigjoke.'' -> ``Averybigjoke.''
```

## Output

```text
The input contains multiple test cases, one in a separate line. Each line contains letters, digits, punc-
tuations and spaces (possibly leading spaces, but no trailing spaces). There will be no TAB character
in the input. The size of input does not exceed 1MB.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line, print the number of actions that are required to remove all the consecutive spaces.

Explanation
If you cant see clearly, here is the sample input, after replacing spaces with underscores:

A*verybigjoke.
Goodbye!

```

## Sample Output

```text
A very big joke.

Goodbye!

```
