title: Uva 11952  Arithmetic
---


## Input

```text
Alice is really bad at arithmetic. Sometimes she cant properly add two single-digit numbers without
using a computer! It is quite embarrassing, so she comes up with silly explanations when someone spots
an error. Last time, after writing 5 + 4 = 10, Alice said  Hey, this is right in base 9!.

Since you know how to program, can you help Alice and check her last bunch of calculations for
any mistakes she might have left? She considers expression correct if equality is satisfied for any
positional numeral system with base B (1  B) (in base 1 character 1 is used as only possible digit).
```

## Output

```text
The number of expressions T (T  100) is given on the first line. Following T lines each have an
expression in format A + B = C, where A, B, C (0  A + B,C  105) are non-negative decimal
integers.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each expression, output a single line with the smallest counting system base B in which expression
is correct. In case there is no such base, output 0.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4
155 + 102 = 301
1022 + 221 = 1303
6502 + 6800 = 11202
515 + 7 = 522

```
