title: Uva 12941  A Subway for Boroughgraph
---


## Input

```
The mayor of Boroughgraph has been promising its inhabitants a new subway system for quite a few
years, and the people are growing impatient. With barely enough money to complete the construction
and even less time, he has hired you, a brilliant Boroughgraphian programmer, to help him with this
project.

The mayor, of course, wants the new subway to favor mostly those whom he thinks will vote for
him, so he has already determined the subway plan. The only problem is that Boroughgraph was built
over a series of swamps, so the subway tunnels can be drilled only at a certain fixed depth below ground
without risking collapse. Since there is no leftover money to invest in overpasses or ground-level lines,
two subway lines can never intersect (except possibly at their endpoints), but their paths need not be
straight.

The subway can be built The subway cannot be built

This is where you come in. Given a specification of a subway network, can you write a program
that tells the mayor whether it is possible to build it in Boroughgraph?
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several subway network specifications. Each specification begins with a line
containing a single integer N indicating the number of subway stations (2  N  64), which are
numbered from 1 to N . Then follow N lines indicating the layout of the subway system: line i contains
exactly di blank-separated integers from 1 to N (excluding i), indicating the stations to which station
i should be connected (1  di  N  1). The subway network is bidirectional, so if station i appears in
station js line, then it is guaranteed that station j will appear in station is line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each specification, print a line with the character Y if the subway can be built in Boroughgraph,
or with the character N, otherwise.
