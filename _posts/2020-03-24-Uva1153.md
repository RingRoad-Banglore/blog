title: Uva 01153  Keep the Customer Satisfied
---


```
Simon and Garfunkel Corporation (SG Corp.) is a large steel-making company with thousand of
customers. Keeping the customer satisfied is one of the major objective of Paul and Art, the managers.

Customers issue orders that are characterized by two integer values q, the amount of steel required
(in tons) and d, the due date (a calender date converted in seconds). The due date has to be met if SG
Corp. accepts the order. Stated another way, when an order is accepted, the corresponding amount of
steel has to be produced before its due date. Of course, the factory can process no more than one order
at a time.

Although the manufacturing process is rather complex, it can be seen as a single production line
with a constant throughput. In the following, we assume that producing q tons of steel takes exactly q
seconds (i.e., throughput is 1). The factory runs on a monthly production plan. Before the beginning of
the month, all customers orders are collected and Paul and Art determine which of them are going to
be accepted and which ones are to be rejected in the next production period. A production schedule is
then designed. To keep customers satisfied, Paul and Art want to minimize the total number of orders
that are rejected. In the following, we assume that the beginning of the next production plan (i.e., the
first day of the next month) corresponds to date 0.

Hogdson and Moore have been appointed as Chief Scientific Officers and you are requested to help
them to compute an optimal solution and to build a schedule of all accepted orders (starting time and
completion time).

Small Example

Consider the following data set made of 6 orders J1, . . . , J6. For a given order, Jj , qj denotes the
amount of steel required and dj is the associated due date.

Order qj dj
J1 6 8
J2 4 9
J3 7 15
J4 8 20
J5 3 21
J6 5 22

You can check by hand that all orders cannot be accepted and its very unlikely you could find a
solution with less than two rejected orders. Here is an optimal solution: Reject J1 and J4, accept all
other orders and process them as follows.

Accepted Order Starting Time Completion Time
J2 0 4
J3 4 11
J5 11 14
J6 14 19

Note that the production line is never idle.

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

Data Each test case is described by one input file that contains all the relevant data: The first line
contains the number n of orders (n can be as large as 800000 for some test cases). It is followed by
n lines. Each of which describes an order made of two integer values: the amount of steel (in tons)
required for the order (lower than 1000) and its due date (in seconds; lower than 2 106).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, you are required to compute an optimal solution and your program has to write the
number of orders that are accepted.

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

Some Hints from Hogdson and Moore

 Hogdson and Moore claim that it is optimal to sequence accepted orders in non-decreasing order
of due dates.

 They also claim that there is an optimal solution such that for any two orders Ju and Jv with
qu > qv and du < dv, if Ju is accepted then Jv is also accepted.

 Finally, Hogdson and Moore advise you to Keep the Customer Satisfied

Keep the Customer Satisfied (Simon & Garfunkel)

Gee but it's great to be back home
Home is where I want to be.
I've been on the road so long my friend,
And if you came along
I know you couldn't disagree.

It's the same old story
Everywhere I go,
I get slandered,
Libeled,
I hear words I never heard
In the bible
And I'm on step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied,
Satisfied.

Deputy sheriff said to me
Tell me what you come here for, boy.
You better get your bags and flee.
You're in trouble boy,
And you're heading into more.
