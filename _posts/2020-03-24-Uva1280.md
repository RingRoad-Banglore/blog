## Input

```text
In her bike rides around Warsaw, Jill happened upon a shop that sold interesting glass bottles. She
thought it might make an interesting project to use such bottles for measuring liquids, but this would
require placing markings on the bottles to indicate various volumes. Where should those volume marks
be placed?

Jill formalized the problem as follows. Assume a bottle is formed by revolving a shape that is the
same as the graph of a polynomial P between x = xlow and x = xhigh around the x-axis. Thus the
x-axis is coincident with a vertical line through the center of the bottle. The bottom of the bottle is
formed by a solid circular region at x = xlow , and the top of the bottle, at x = xhigh, is left open.

The first sample input represents a bottle formed using the simple polynomial 4  0.25x, with
xlow = 0 and xhigh = 12. The bottom of this bottle is a circle with a radius of 4, and the opening at the
top is a circle with a radius of 1. The height of this bottle is 12. Volume markings are in increments of
25.

Given a polynomial P , xlow, xhigh, and the volume increment between successive marks on the
bottle, compute the distances up from xlow for the marks at successive volume increments. A mark
cannot be made past the top of the bottle, and no more than the first 8 increments should be marked.
Assume the value of P is greater than zero everywhere between xlow and xhigh.

## Output

```text
Each test case consists of three lines of bottle data:

 Line 1: n, the degree of the polynomial (an integer satisfying 0  n  10).

 Line 2: a0, a1, . . . , an, the real coefficients of the polynomial P defining the bottles shape, where
a0 is the constant term, a1 is the coefficient of x1, . . ., and an is the coefficient of xn. For each
i,100  ai  100, and an = 0.

 Line 3:

 xlow and xhigh, the real valued boundaries of the bottle (100  xlow < xhigh  100 and
xhigh  xlow > 0.1).

 inc, an integer which is the volume increment before each successive mark on the bottle
(1  inc  500).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, display the case number and the volume of the full bottle on one line. On a second
line, display the increasing sequence of no more than 8 successive distances up from the bottom of the
bottle for the volume markings. All volumes and height marks should be accurate to two decimal places.
If the bottle does not have a volume that allows at least one mark, display the phrase insufficient
volume. No test case will result in a mark within 0.01 from the top of the bottle. The volume of the
bottle will not exceed 1 000. All rounded distances for marks on a bottle differ by at least 0.05.
