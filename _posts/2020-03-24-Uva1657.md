## Input

```text

There is a legend that mathematicians in the XVIII century enjoyed playing the following game.
The game was played by three mathematicians. One of them was the game master. First of all,

the game master declared some positive integer number N . After that he chose two different integer
numbers X and Y ranging from 1 to N and told their sum to one player and their product to the other
player. Each player knew whether he was told the sum or the product of the chosen numbers.

After that the players in turn informed the game master whether they knew the numbers he had
chosen. First the player who was told the sum said whether he knew the numbers, after that the player
who was told the product did, and so on.

For example the dialog could look like this.
Game master: Let N be 10.
After that he chooses two numbers ranging from 1 to 10 and tells their sum to player S and their

product to player P .
Player S: I dont know these numbers.
Player P : I dont know these numbers.
Player S: I dont know these numbers.
Player P : I dont know these numbers.
Player S: Oh, now I know these numbers. You have chosen 3 and 6.
Given N and M - the number of times the players have said I dont know these numbers, you

have to find all possible pairs of numbers that could have been chosen by the game master.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several dataset. The first line of each dataset contains N and M (2  N  200, 0 
M  100).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each dataset, first output the number of possible pairs of numbers that could have been chosen
by the game master from the range 1 to N if both players altogether had said I dont know these
numbers M times. After that output these pairs in arbitrary order, one on a line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 4
