title: Uva 11102  Moonshine
---


```
Granny is preparing moonshine whiskey for an
upcoming family reunion. Because her family
is large, she needs to make several batches of
whiskey, which she collects in a large metal
cream can. After making, and sampling, sev-
eral batches Granny stumbles and knocks the
can on its side. Fortunately, the lid is tightly
fixed so no whiskey is lost.

Our question to you is this: assuming that
the depth of whiskey in the can was k cm with
the can sitting upright, what is its depth with
the can lying horizontal? The can itself is made
of two cylinders: the body with height hb and
diameter db, and the neck with height hn and
diameter dn. The neck and body are joined by
a tapered conic shoulder such that the overall height of the can is h. The bottom and lid of the can are
disks of diameter db and dn respectively.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing real numbers k hb db hn dn
and h. You may assume that 100  h  hb + hn and that 100  db  dn.

A line containing 0 0 0 0 0 0 follows the last test case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line containing s the depth with the can lying horizontally, rounded to two
decimal places.
