title: Uva 13021  Game of Cards
---


## Input

```text
Alice and Bob created a new game while at the beach this sum-
mer. All they need is a set of numbered playing cards. They
start by creating P piles with all cards face-up and select a non-
negative number K. After that, they take turns like this:

1. A player starts by selecting one of the piles.

2. Then, he removes from 0 up to K cards from the top of that
pile, leaving at least one card in the pile.

3. Next, he looks at the card left at the top of the pile and
must remove a number of cards equal to its value (from the
top of the same pile).

Whoever doesnt have more cards to remove, or whoever is
forced to remove more cards than those available on a pile, loses the game.

In the figure, you can see an example with two
piles and K = 1. The player to move might:

a) Select the first pile and 0 cards to remove, being
forced to remove 1 card from the top next.

b) Select the second pile and 0 cards to remove,
having to remove 1 card from the top next.

c) Select the second pile and 1 card to remove,
having to remove 2 cards from the top next.

Alice has realized that Bob is very good at this
game and will always win if he has the chance. Luck-
ily, this time Alice is first to play. Is Alice able to
win this game?

Given the description of the piles with all the
cards and the maximum number of cards they can
start to remove, your goal is to find out whether Al-
ice can win the game if she is the first to play.

number of cards they can start to remove on their turn. The next P lines start with an integer N ,
indicating the number of cards on a pile. N space separated integers follow, representing the cards on
that pile from the bottom to the top.
