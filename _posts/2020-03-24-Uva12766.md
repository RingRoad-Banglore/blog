title: Uva 12766  Grinding Grid
---


```

We are given an N  N letter grid where exactly one cell
in each row and each column contains a letter A and the
remaining N2 N cells contain a letter B. We can flip a
B to an A in a cell if at least two of its neighbours already
contain an A. Cells are considered to be neighbours if they
share an edge.

Can you fill all N2 squares by As?
```

## Input

```
First line of the input contains an integer T (1  T  30),
the number of test cases. Then follow 2  T lines, where
each 2 consecutive lines contain the description of one test
case

For each test case, the first of the two lines contains an
integer N , the size of the grid (2  N  100, 000).

The second line contains a permutation of first N pos-
itive integers, indicating the columns in which As are already filled, in order of rows. For example, if
N = 4 and given columns are 4 2 1 3, As are in cells (1,4), (2,2), (3,1) and (4,3).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print one line with the text yes or no, indicating that the grid can be filled entirely
with As or not.
