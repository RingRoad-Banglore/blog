title: Uva 11270  Tiling Dominoes
---


```
Given a rectangular grid, with dimensions m n, compute the number of ways of completely tiling it
with dominoes. Note that if the rotation of one tiling matches another, they still count as different
ones. A domino is a shape formed by the union of two unit squares meeting edge-to-edge. Equivalently,
it is a matching in the grid graph formed by placing a vertex at the center of each square of the region
and connecting two vertices when they correspond to adjacent squares. An example of a tiling is shown
below.
```

## Input

```
The input will consist of a set of lines with m n, given the restriction n m < 101.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input, output the number of tilings in a separate line.

```

## Sample Input

```
2 10
4 10
8 8

```

## Sample Output

```
89
18061
12988816
```
