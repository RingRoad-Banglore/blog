title: Uva 01670  Kingdom Roadmap
---


## Input

```

The Kingdom consists of n cities connected by n 1 roads in such a way that there is exactly one way
to travel from one city to another.

The King is a busy man and he constantly travels from city to city. Unfortunately, during one of
his travels one of the roads got damaged and needed serious repairs. As a result, the King was unable
to reach his destination in time.

After the incident the King decided to improve reliability of the road system. It was decided that
the improved road system shall be able to withstand one damaged road, i.e. there shall always be a
path from one city to another even when one road in the Kingdom is damaged. As always, the budget
is limited so you need to minimize the number of new roads.

For example, the picture below shows 5 Kingdoms cities numbered from 1 to 5 and roads between
them in solid lines. One of the ways to build new roads is shown in dashed lines.

Your task is to build as few new roads as possible so that there is always a path between any two
cities even if one of the roads gets unusable for any reason. There may be multiple optimal solutions.
Any one can be used.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line of each test case contains integer n  the number of cities in the kingdom (2  n 

100000).
The following n  1 lines contain two integers ui, vi each  the cities connected by i-th road

(1  ui, vi  n).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, write to the output as described below.
The first line of the output file shall contain one integer k  the number of roads to be built. The

following k lines shall contain two integers ai, bi each  the cities which should be connected by i-th
new road (1  ai, bi  n).
