title: Uva 00436  Arbitrage II
---


## Input

```
Arbitrage is the use of discrepancies in currency exchange rates to transform one unit of a currency
into more than one unit of the same currency. For example, suppose that 1 US Dollar buys 0.5 British
pound, 1 British pound buys 10.0 French francs, and 1 French franc buys 0.21 US dollar. Then, by
converting currencies, a clever trader can start with 1 US dollar and buy 0.5 * 10.0 * 0.21 = 1.05 US
dollars, making a profit of 5 percent.

Your job is to write a program that takes a list of currency exchange rates as input and then
determines whether arbitrage is possible or not.
```

## Output

```
The input file will contain one or more test cases. On the first line of each test case there is an integer
n (1  n  30), representing the number of different currencies. The next n lines each contain the
name of one currency. Within a name no spaces will appear. The next line contains one integer m,
representing the length of the table to follow. The last m lines each contain the name ci of a source
currency, a real number rij which represents the exchange rate from ci to cj and a name cj of the
destination currency. Exchanges which do not appear in the table are impossible.

Test cases are separated from each other by a blank line. Input is terminated by a value of zero (0)
for n.
