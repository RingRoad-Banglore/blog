## Input

```

You are working as an HR officer in Nice Computer Programmers Company(NCPC). You have to
hire a lot of people in a very short period. The hiring process is simple. Interview all the applicants,
grade them, select the ones who survived the interview board, then assign them to projects. So, you can
see, the hardest job is interviewing the candidates, and find who is capable of working in NCPC. Dont
worry, you dont need to do that. You will be given a list of candidates, who survived the interview,
sorted according to their scores given by the interviewers. You need to to assign them to different
projects. Simple, isnt it? But, unfortunately, this is not as easy as it seems to be.

There are N candidates and M different projects, each project requiring ri programmers. You know
that, not everyone is interested in working in any position. For example, not everyone likes the job of
tester, or QA Engineer. Every applicant has given you a list of job, they can work, according to their
preferences. Since, NCPC needs to hire a lot of people, they have decided to recruit maximum number
of programmers, they can from current candidates.

There can be more than one way to select maximum number of candidates. That is where their
grades and preferences comes into play. If there is more than one way to fill the maximum number of
spot, give the highest ranked candidate his most preferred position you can. If there is still more than
one way, give the second highest ranked candidate, his most preferred position possible, and so on.
