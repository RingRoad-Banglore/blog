title: Uva 13223  Graph Colorings
---


## Input

```text
Given a full bipartite graph, such that the number of vertices on both sides of the graph is exactly the
same. We want to color each edge into three colors: red, blue, or green, such any two red edges do not
share the same vertex, while any two blue edges do not share the same. Calculate the number of such
colorings!
```

## Output

```text
A number of test cases ( 1000), one per line, each with N (0  N  10000000), which is the number
of vertices on each side of the graph (a total of 2 N vertices).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the answer on one line, modulo 1000000007.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1
2

```
