title: Uva 00960  Gaussian Primes
---


```

The complex numbers a+ bi, where i =

1 and a and b are integers, are called the Gaussian integers.

The norm of a complex number is given by

a2 + b2. Every Gaussian integer can be factorized as a

product of Gaussian primes. You task is to determine if a given Gaussian integer is a prime, i.e., if it
can not be written as the product of two other Gaussian integers, x and y, where both x and y have
norms larger than 1 (This is the same as requiring both x and y to be different from 1, 1, i and
i). For example, 2 = (1 + i)(1  i), and, therefore, 2 is not a prime. 11 is a Gaussian prime, but
13 = (3 + 2i)(3 2i) is not a prime. In the same way, 3 + i = (1 + i)(2 i) is not a prime.

## Input

```
You are given a list of n Gaussian integers. The first number, n, in a row by itself, is the number of
Gaussian integers that follow. This number is followed by n pairs of (possibly negative) integers, one
per row, representing, respectively, the real and imaginary part of each Gaussian integer. The absolute
value of the real and imaginary parts of every input number will be no larger than 10000, and the list
will not have more than 100 numbers. Additionally, every pair (a,b) satisfies a2 + b2  2.

```

## Output

```
For each Gaussian prime in the input, you should write the letter P, for Prime. For each non-prime,
you should write the letter C, for Composite.
