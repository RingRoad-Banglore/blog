title: Uva 11421  Arranging Cards
---


```
Given n (n  50) different cards, youre going to arrange them in a sequence so that adjacent cards
always have different ranks.

Each card is represented by two characters: its rank (2..9, T for ten, J for Jack, Q for Queen, K for
King, A for Ace) and suite (S for Spade, C for Club, H for Heart, D for Diamond). The whole sequence
is represented by the concatenation of all the cards. For example, 6H7DJDKC is a valid sequence, but
6H7D7SKC is not, because there are two adjacent cards 7D and 7S with the same rank.

Given a positive integer k (1  k  1018), find the lexicographically k-th smallest sequence.
```

## Input

```
The input contains at most 1000 test cases. Each case begins with two integers n and k in the first
line. The second line contains n cards separated by a single space. The case with n = 0 indicates the
end of the input and should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the case number and the answer. If there is no such sequence, print Not found
(without quotes). Insert a single space between each two adjacent cards to make it look better.

```

## Sample Input

```
6 1
2S 3S 3C 4S 4C 4D
6 120
2S 3S 3C 4S 4C 4D
6 121
2S 3S 3C 4S 4C 4D
16 654321234567
2S 3S 4S 5S 2C 3C 4C 5C 2D 3D 4D 5D 2H 3H 4H 5H
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 2S 4C 3C 4D 3S 4S
Case 2: 4S 3S 4D 3C 4C 2S
Case 3: Not found
Case 4: 5D 4S 2D 5H 3S 4H 5S 2H 3D 2C 5C 4D 2S 3C 4C 3H
```
