title: Uva 11655  Water Land
---


```
The year 3110. Most of the lands have disappeared under water, leaving many small islands. Waterland
is a peaceful country consisting of many such islands. All islands in Waterland are connected by tunnels.
Each tunnel connects exactly two islands. Tunnels are very expensive to build, so WRTA (Waterland
Road and Tunnel Authorities) tries to keep the number of tunnels as low as possible. (You may be
wondering why not just use air transport! Air transport can no longer be used due to terrible weather
condition.)

President of Waterland wants to spend his upcoming vacation in Yablonoi Island, after the long
and tedious hours of work at office (Kurai Island). The Elite Security Force (ESF) of Waterland, who
is responsible for presidents security, always takes precautions before his journey. They have selected
some of the safe tunnels from Kurai Island to Yablonoi island. Safe tunnels are chosen in such a way
that if anyone starts to travel from Kuriai island to Yablonoi Island, it is not possible to visit any island
twice with any possible route.

ESF sends a group of teams in all routes from Kurai Island to Yablonoi Island. Each group of teams
drops one team at each island (except Kuroi  the presidents office) on their route and moves on. At
the end, for each route, only one team from each group will reach in Yablonoi Island. Therefore, one
island may contain multiple teams from different groups. Now the Chief of ESF asks you to calculate the
total number of teams required for the whole process and the number of teams reached at destination
(Yablonoi Island).
```

## Input

```
First line of the input represents the number of test cases N (N  40). Each test case starts with a
line containing 2 numbers L and T , where L represents the number of island (2  L  5000) in that
country and T (0  T  5  L) represents the number of safe tunnels. After that, there will be T lines
with two numbers: x and y (1  x, y  L) representing the tunnel between island x and island y. All
of these tunnels are one way (from x to y) on that day (for the sake of presidents safety). There will
be at most one tunnel between any two islands. Consider the island 1 as Kurai island and island L
as Yablonoi island.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number first followed by two numbers, S and D where S represents
the number of teams that is required by ESF for the whole process and D represents the number of
teams that reached in the meeting place after the whole operation. Print both numbers (S and D) in
modulo 100,000.
