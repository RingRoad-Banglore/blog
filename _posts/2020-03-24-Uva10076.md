title: Uva 10076  The Bumpy Robot
---


## Input

```text
The bumpy robot moves around an M  N grid of square blocks. Each block has an integral height.
To move from a block of height h1 to an adjacent block of height h2, the amount of energy required is,

E =




1(h1  h2)+ , if h1 > h2
, if h1 = h2
2(h2  h1)+ , if h1 < h2

and the amount of time required is,

T =




1(h1  h2)+ , if h1 > h2
, if h1 = h2
2(h2  h1)+ , if h1 < h2

Here, 1, 2, , 1, 2 and  are some known constants.
The bumpy robot must move from a given starting block to a target block in minimum amount of

time that is possible without consuming more than a given amount of energy. Please help him find out
whether it is possible for him to move to the target block under the given constraint and if possible to
determine the minimum amount of time required for reaching there.

Note that two blocks are assumed to be adjacent if they have a side in common.
```

## Output

```text
The input may contain multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers
M and N (1  M,N  15). The second line contains two positive floating point numbers 1 and 2,
and a positive integer . The second line contains two more positive floating point numbers 1 and 2,
and another positive integer . Then follow M lines containing N integers each giving the height of the
corresponding block in the grid. The top-left corner of the grid is assumed to be in row 1 and column
1. The next line contains five integers rs, cs, rt, ct and E, where (rs, cs) is the row, column numbers
of the starting block, (rt, ct) is the row-column number of the target block and E (1  E  200) is the
energy constraint for the bumpy robot.

A test case containing two zeros for M and N terminates the input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input file print a line containing the minimum time required if the target is
reachable, print failed otherwise.
