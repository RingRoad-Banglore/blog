```
Have you ever looked at formulae of the form Cos(NA)? If you havent looked at them yet, just look
at them now:

Cos(2A) = 2Cos2(A) 1
Cos(3A) = 4Cos3(A) 3Cos(A)
Cos(4A) = 8Cos4(A) 8Cos2(A) + 1

These formulae will make you believe that any Cos(NA) can be expanded in an expression which
contains only one function Cos(A) and all the coefficients are also integers. In this problem your job is
to find such a formula for Cos(NA) given the value of N .
```

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 50 lines of inputs. Each line contains a positive integer N (N < 50).
Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input except the last one you should produce one line of output. This line should
contain the formula (As described in the problem statment) for Cos(NA). You dont need to print any
redundant things in the output such as (a) Printing operators in two consecutive places (b) Printing
the exponent when it is 1 (c) Printing the coefficient when it is 1 (d) Just look at the output for sample
input for details.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
3
4
0

```

## Sample Output

```
2Cos^2(A)-1
4Cos^3(A)-3Cos(A)
8Cos^4(A)-8Cos^2(A)+1
```
