title: Uva 00788  One Day Tours
---


## Input

```text

A hotel needs a program to assist any tourist who wants to visit N different places (N  20). Every
day the tourist leaves the hotel, visits M places (may be fewer on the last day) and comes back to the
hotel.

Let us consider that the hotel is identified by 0, the places to visit by consecutive positive integers
and the available roads by triples (i, j, d), where d represents the road length (in km) and 0  i < j  N .
```

## Output

```text
The input file includes data about several tourists. For each tourist the available roads (at least 2) and
a negative value (v < 1) which designates the number of visits to be scheduled for one day (M = v)
are given, as in the sample input below.

The program must schedule the visits according to the following constraints:

 each place is visited only once;

 a place must be visited when reached for the first time (afterwards it can be included in any tour
as a passing by point);

 the total travel must be as short as possible;

 ties are solved by applying the shorter one day tour rule, from the last to the first day ([ ... 180
km 50 km] is preferred to [... 200 km 50 km]);

 if the tie is not solved by the above rule, the preferred place first rule is applied (the schedule 1
3 5 ... is preferred to 1 3 7 ...).

```

## Sample Input

```text
The resulting schedules are stored in the output file in the following format:

== Tourist i -- M visits a day --

Day 1: [dfh] - fvp - [dpp] - ..... - lvp - [dth]

. . . . . .

===

where, for each day tour

 dfh - distance from hotel to the first visited place

 fvp - index of the first visited place

 dpp - distance between consecutive visited places

 lvp - index of the last visited place

 dfh - distance from last visited place to the hotel
