---


## Input

```
You have been hired to arrange the seating of diplomats at a dinner party. Your employer has invited
9 diplomats from several countries around the world. Each diplomat will speak from one to five
languages. Diplomats not speaking a common language can not talk to each other. Furthermore,
some of the countries represented will not have diplomatic relations with other nations represented,
so these diplomats will not be speaking to each other either. Your task is to determine the seating
arrangement at the dinner table for your employer and the 9 guests such that each person can speak
to the person seated on each side.

The table to be used for dinner is round, and seats 10 people. Your employer will be seated at the
first position at the table. The other positions will be numbered clockwise from 2 to 10. The person
seated to the left of your employer is in seat number 2, the person seated to the right of your employer
is in seat number 10.

Persons seated next to each other must speak a common language. A person may speak to the
person on the left in one common language, and speak to the person on the right in another language.

The governments of the guests seated next to each other must have formally recognized each other.
The government of your employer has diplomatic relations with the governments of all of his guests.
The government of a guest may or may not have diplomatic relations with the governments of all the
other guests.

Two diplomats from the same country will have diplomatic relations with the same list of countries.
A country will always have diplomatic relations with itself. Diplomats from the same country may or
may not speak any languages in common.
