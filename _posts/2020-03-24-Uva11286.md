formity prize to frosh who choose
the most popular combination of
courses. How many frosh will win
the prize?
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases followed by a line containing 0. Each test case begins with
an integer 1  n  10000, the number of frosh. For each frosh, a line follows containing the course
numbers of five distinct courses selected by the frosh. Each course number is an integer between 100
and 499.

The popularity of a combination is the number of frosh selecting exactly the same combination
of courses. A combination of courses is considered most popular if no other combination has higher
popularity.
