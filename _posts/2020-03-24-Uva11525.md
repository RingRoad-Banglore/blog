```

Given N and K find the N -th permutation of the integers from 1 to K when those permutations are
lexicographically ordered. N starts from 0. Since N is very large N will be represented by a sequence
of K non-negative integers S1, S2, . . . , Sk. From this sequence of integers N can be calculated with
the following expression.

K
i=1

Si  (K  i)!
```

## Input

```
First line of the input contains T ( 10) the number of test cases. Each of these test cases consists of
2 lines. First line contains a integer K (1  K  50000). Next line contains K integers S1, S2, . . . , Sk.
(0  Si  K  i).

```

## Output

```
For each test case output contains N -th permutation of the integers from 1 to K. These K integers
should be separated by a single space.
