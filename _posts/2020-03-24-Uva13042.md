```
Imagine you are working for a search engine company called Ikroch. People do a lot of spelling mistakes
when searching in your search engine. So you need to develop a program which corrects users queries.

In this problem, for each test case you are given a list of dictionary words and their corresponding
weights and a lot of queries. Each query is a line which consists of a search input qi followed by an
integer X. The search input qi of the query is composed of a list of space separated lowercase words.

For each query, correct all words of the search input by the following rules.

1. If the word is exactly found inside the dictionary dont change the word.

2. Otherwise, if the word is within X Ikroch Distance with another word found in the dictionary,
then replace the word with the dictionary word. If more than one word from the dictionary
matches with the word then pick the word with the highest weight. If more than one words form
dictionary has the same weight then lexicographically smallest word will be chosen.

3. If none of the above rules is applicable, delete the word from search input.

Two words is within X Ikroch Distance, if using at most X of following operations, one word can
be changed to another:

1. You can insert a character in any place in the word.

2. You can remove any character from the word.

Like Ikroch Distance of WA and AC is 2 (Remove W and add C in last of WA). Ikroch Distance of
ABCD and B is 3.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 10) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a
line containing two integers dw (1  dw  4104) and q (1  q  105). dw denotes number of dictionary
words and q denotes number of queries. Each of the next dw lines will contain a string of lowercase
letters di (1  length of(di)  10) denoting a dictionary word and an integer wi (1  wi  103)
denoting its weight. Each of the next q lines will contain multiple space separated lower case search
input qw (1  length of(qw)  10) followed by an integer X (0  X  1). The length of each query
line is not more than 50.

Constraint for each test case:

i=dw
i=1

length of(di)  2  105

i=qw
i=1

length of(qi)  2  105

All characters will be in the range of [a-z]

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number in a single line. Then for each query you have to print a
line containing search input corrected by Ikroch. Consecutive words of corrected search input should
be separated by a single space (if corrected search input contains more than one word).

Notes:

 Explanation of 1st test case:
Ikroch Distance (wird, weird) = 1
Ikroch Distance (wird, wired) = 1
But because weird has a higher weight than wired thus output will be weird. The word problem
is located inside the dictionary so this is just returned.

 Explanation of 2nd test case: No word is found for its within 1 Ikroch Distance so skipped.
Both hard and herd have 1 Ikroch Distance with heard. Both answers have same weight, thus
hard is returned as its lexicographically smallest.
Ikroch Distance (wether, weather) = 1
Ikroch Distance (wether, whether) = 1
But because weather has a higher weight than whether thus output will be weather.
