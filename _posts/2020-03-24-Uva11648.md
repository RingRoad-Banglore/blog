title: Uva 11648  Divide the Land
---


```
Mr. Rahim Mia has some lands of trapezium shape. He wants to divide each of the lands between
his two sons so that everyone gets equal area in every land. But as Mr. Rahim is not so good at
mathematics, he is confused how to divide the lands equally. He decided to divide the land with a line
parallel to the parallel lines of the trapezium. Yet he is getting problem to determine the points to
draw the line. So he came to you. Please write a program for him that finds the distance of the points
along the non-parallel lines of the trapezium to from the longer parallel line that will divide the land
into two equal parts in terms of area. For example, consider the following figure, you have to find the
lengths AE and BF so that ABFE and EFCD are equal in area and EF||AB given AB, BC, CD, DA.
```

## Input

```
The first line of Input will be a number mentioning the number of lands Mr. Rahim has (at most 500).
Each of the following numbers is description of Rahims land. Each description will consist of 4 positive
integers mentioning AB, CD, AD and BC (less than 10000). You may assume that AB||CD and AB >
CD. You may also assume that all of Rahims lands are trapezium shaped and has a positive area.

```

## Output

```
For each of the lands you should output the number of the land and then the lengths AE and BF as
two real numbers. Up to 1e-6 error in your output will be acceptable.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
15 12 9 10
12 6 5 5

```

## Sample Output

```
Land #1: 4.250767 4.723074
Land #2: 2.094306 2.094306
```
