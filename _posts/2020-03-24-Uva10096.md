## Input

```text
Today I am going to tell you the story of the Richest Man of the Universe. He lives in planet Archadia
that is 200 light years away from the Earth. A parallel human civilization exists in that planet. His
name is Charge Doors. A strange name to us but if you are very intelligent you find the significance of
his name. He graduated (probably) from a University which is now the best in the Universe for Medical
Study (You may wonder why you dont know this University. It is because the news is broadcasted
from Archadia and you will know it 200 years later!) Though he is a very brilliant programmer, in his
student life he spent much of his time in a Virus Research Lab for some unknown reasons (maybe his
friends know). He worked there with a kind of Virus called Archadian Bascillae. These viruses are
circular in shape. They can do two operations: fission and fusion. Fission occurs in breeding season
and fusion occurs during hostile season.

In breeding season each virus is kept in a rectangular transparent box. After fission two viruses
of equal size and shape (circular of course) is created. After fission they maintain maximum possible
distance between them in the box. Given the radius of the initial virus and the size of the box it
was kept in you will have to determine the maximum distance possible between the centers of the two
viruses.

Fig 1: Fission Operation Fig 2: Fusion Operation

During fusion two viruses merges but this merging is not complete. Some portion of one virus
overlaps some portion of the other virus. The thickness of their common portion is doubled but
thickness in all other portion remains the same (This incident is like two rigid disks stick to each other
with the help of glue). The thing to note here is that all the single viruses are of equal thickness though
their size may vary. You will have to determine the area covered by these semi-merged viruses.

You have to solve this problem, as you are about to give an interview to his large software company.
For some odd reasons he asks everyone to solve this problem.

## Output

```text
First line of the input file contains an integer N that indicates how many sets of inputs are there. Next
N lines contains N sets of inputs.

Every input begins with a character C whose value is either S (for fission) or M (for fusion).
For fission, next there will be three real numbers, L (length of the rectangular box), W (width of

the rectangular box) and R (radius of the virus to make fission). For fusion after character M there
will be three real numbers, R1 (radius of the first virus), R2 (radius of the second virus) and d (the
distance between these two viruses and d  max(R1, R2)).

No numerical value in the input will be negative and also there value will not exceed 2000.

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input you will have to print one or two lines of output.

For fission type input you will have to print the maximum possible distance between the centers of
the two viruses according to the sample output format. If there is not enough space for fission in the
rectangular box print the line Not enough space for fission. Fission is impossible if the viruses
cannot remain separated (not overlapped) in the box at any possible position. If fission is impossible
then there is no need to print the maximum possible distance.

For fusion type of input you have to print the compaction ratio of the virus according to the sample
output. Compaction Ratio is defined as

Surface area covered by the merged virus

Area covered by first virus before merging +Area covered by second virus before merging

When the printed compaction ratio is 1.0000 you will have to print in the next line No compaction
has occurred.

Another important thing is that when no merging has occurred you will have to print the compaction
ratio as 1.0000 and in the next line you will have to print, No compaction has occurred.

Print a blank line after the output for each set of input.
