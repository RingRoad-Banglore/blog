## Input

```

Fig. The collection of points from
which the robot can localize itself.

Jiajia wants to do some experiments on his two-eyed robot. Each
eye of the robot shoots a very thin laser beam from it, which goes
infinitely (i.e. a mathematical ray). Restricted by the internal
structure, the two laser beams from the eyes must always form a
right angle (i.e. two rays must be perpendicular to each other).

To help the robot localize itself, Jiajia placed two linear-
shaped special materials called MA and MB. If one of the rays
intersects with MA, while the other ray intersects with MB, the
robot is able to gather enough spatial information for the local-
ization.

The weird shape in the picture above is the collection of points
from which the robot can localize itself. MA and MB are drawn
as two line segments.

Though the task seems a little bit difficult, can you tell me
the total area of these points?
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 50 test cases. Each case contains a single line of 8 positive integers
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 not greater than 500, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two endpoints of MA,
(x3, y3) and (x4, y4) are two endpoints of MB. Note that MA and MB can have at most one common
point. Neither MA nor MB will be degenerated to a point. The last test case is followed by 8 zeros,
which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the total area of self-localizable point, to 3 digits after the decimal point.

Print a blank line after the output of each test case.
