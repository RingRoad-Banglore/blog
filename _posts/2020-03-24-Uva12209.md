## Input

```text
I think most of you are familiar with the footnotes. They reside at the bottom of the page, describing
various terms in that page. Some authors describe them as Footnotes, the little dogs yapping at the
heels of the text.

You are given an article of N lines, where some of which has keywords that need to be footnoted.
Say, if you have the word copotron (Copotron: As described in science fiction novel Copotronic
Shukh Dukhkho (Aka Emotions) by M. Zafar Iqbal, Copotron is the brain of a robot.) in pages 1, 3, 7
and 8, then all these 4 pages should have a footnote about copotron. Since, a page can have at most
S lines, if you place Mi lines from the article in one page, you can place at most (S Mi) numbers of
footnotes at that page.

Each page will have a number of consecutive lines, and if, the last line of page i is line b, then first
line of page (i+ 1) will be line (b+ 1).

Given the number of lines in the article, and the positions of the referenced words, find the minimum
number of footnotes that has to be added.
```

## Output

```text
First line contains an integer T (1  T  35), the number of test cases. This is followed by three
integers N (1  N  500), S (1  S  100) and W (0  W  100), the number of lines in the
article, number of lines that can fit in a page and the number of keywords. Next W lines each describe
the positions of each keyword. Each of these W lines starts with an integer Ki (1  Ki  N), the
frequency of keyword i, followed by Ki integers, the lines in the article, where they can be found. The
line numbers will be between 1 and N .

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the case number, followed by the minimum number of footnotes to add. If
its not possible to fit them, output -1.

Description of the sample input/output
In case 1: if you place two lines in the first page, and 3 on the second, then, first page will require

1 foot note for first keyword since it contains keyword 1 in lines 1 and 2, and 2nd page will require 2
footnotes for keywords 2 and 3, since they appear in lines 3,4 and 5. You can achieve similar result, if
you place lines 1-2 on first page, 3-4 on second, and 5 on third page.

In case 2: You can place at most 2 lines per page. There are 3 keywords, keyword 1 in lines 1 and
2, keyword 2 in lines 3 and 4, and keyword 3 in line 5. So, lines 1-5 each contain one keyword. We can
fit at most two lines in a page. If we place 1 line in each page, then, we have to add 1 footnote as well.
So, for 5 lines with keywords, we need 5 more footnotes. Please note that, its not possible to place 2
lines in any page, since, it would require 2 footnotes, and thus a total of 2 + 2 = 4 lines, which is more
than S.

In case 3: You can not place line 1 in any page, if you place it anywhere, there wont be any space
available to place the footnote, since maximum number of lines per page is 1.
