## Input

```

So Kianos child Riano likes her fathers long beard. She started calling him Candy Clause because this
tall and bearded person likes to play Candy Crush and looks like angry Santa Clause. One day, Kiano,
bored with easy challenges (!) of Candy Crush started a new and simple game with Fallen. Fallen
and Kiano start playing on an N  5 board, called the game board. Initially all the cells of the board
contains 0. Then they ask Riano, the judge of the game, to show them an interesting board. Riano
sets an M  5 board that is divided into M rows and 5 columns called interesting board. Each of the
cells of the interesting board contains either 0 or 1.

Now in his only turn, Fallen can change any number of 0s to 1s on the game board. After Fallens
move, Kiano, in his only turn, can change any number of 1s to 0s on the game board. If Kiano can
make any M 5 sub board exactly the same as the interesting board set by the honorable judge Riano,
Kiano wins. Otherwise Fallen gets the point equal to number of cells he changed in his turn.

Fallen wants to win the game at any cost and he also wants to win as many points as possible. Print
the maximum possible point Fallen can win. If Fallen loses the game, print -1 instead.
