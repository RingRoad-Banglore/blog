title: Uva 11768  Lattice Point or Not
---


```
Now a days a very common problem is:

The coordinate of two points in Cartesian coordinate system is (200, 300) and (4000, 5000).
If these two points are connected we get a line segment. How many lattice points are there
on this line segment.

You will have to do a similar task in this problem  the only difference is that the terminal
coordinates can be fractions.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input file contains a positive integer N (N  50000) that denotes how many lines of
inputs follow. This line is followed by N lines each of which contains four floating-point numbers x1,
y1, x2, y2 (0 < |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2|  200000). These floating-point numbers has exactly one digit after
the decimal point.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input except the first line produce one line of output. This line contains an integer
which denotes how many lattice points are there on the line segment that connects the two points
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

10.1 10.1 11.2 11.2
10.2 100.3 300.3 11.1
1.0 1.0 2.0 2.0

```

## Sample Output

```
