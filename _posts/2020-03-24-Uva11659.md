The Agency of Counter-intelligence of Macondo, ACM in short, is willing to put to the test the quality
of its informants with a simple, yet highly accurate, procedure that evaluates how trustworthy a group
of informants is.

The ACM determines the confidence of a group of informants by surveying the confidence among
them: informants assert their particular opinions about other ones, even themselves. As a result of
the survey, the ACM gathers a set of assertions of the form X says Y is reliable or X says Y is
not reliable. If X happens to be reliable, the ACM assumes that whatever he or she says, can be
interpreted to be true. Otherwise, if X is not reliable, his or her opinions may be either true or false.
At the end, the ACM qualifies the situation by determining the maximum number of informants that
can be reliable according to the surveyed answers.

As an example, lets assume there are four informants A, B, C and D, with the following surveyed
answers: A says B is reliable but D is not, B says C is not reliable, and C says A and D are
reliable. In this case, it happens that at most two informants are reliable.

Your task is to help the ACM by writing an efficient program that, given the results of the survey,
computes the maximum number of informants that may be reliable.
```

## Input

```
The problems input has several cases. Each test case begins with a line with two nonnegative integer
numbers, i (0 < i  20) and a (0  a  800), separated by blanks. i is the number of informants and
a is the number of answers in the confidence survey. Then, a lines follow, each one with two integer
numbers x and y (1  x  i, 1  |y|  i), separated by blanks. If y is positive, the input line means
that informant x says informant y is reliable. If y is negative, the then the line means that informant
x says informant y is not reliable. The end of the input is indicated by a line with two 0 values (an
artificial case that should be ignored).

```

## Output

```
For each input case, output in a single line the corresponding answer, i.e., the maximum number of
reliable informants according to the answers in the survey.
