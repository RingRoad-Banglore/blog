title: Uva 10979  How many triangles
---


```
How many triangles are there in the following figure?

... ding! Times up. The answer is 29.
Given at most 10 line segments, you are to write a program that counts the number of triangles

bounded by them. Note that three colinear points do not make a triangle.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases. Each case begins with a line containing an integer N (3  N  10).
The following N lines each gives four integers, x1, y1, x2 and y2, meaning that you draw a straight line
segment from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). All the coordinates given have their absolute values no greater than
100.

Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the number of triangles bounded by the N lines.

```
