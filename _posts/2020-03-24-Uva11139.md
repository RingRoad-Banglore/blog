title: Uva 11139  Counting Quadrilaterals
---


## Input

```
In the 10 10 grid below you can see five different lattice quadri-
laterals. (A lattice quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose vertices
have integer coordinates. A quadrilateral is a polygon with four
sides and is not self intersecting. None of the internal angles of
a Quadrilateral can be equal to 180 degree) Of course these are
only a few lattice quadrilaterals of the millions that can be drawn
in this 10 10 grid. Given an (N N) grid your job is to count
the number of different lattice quadrilaterals in that grid.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 150 sets of inputs. Each line
contains an integer N (0 < N < 121). Input is terminated by a
line where the value of N is zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains two integers. First integer is the
input number N and the second integer denotes the number of quadrilaterals in an (N N) grid. It is
guaranteed that the second integer will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

Warning: This problem has no alternate solution so can have mistakes. Actually a brute force solution
is written to verify the answers. But that could only verify answers up to (22 22) grid after running
for 14 hours.

Tips: The time limit of this problem is 3 seconds and has only specific amount of judge input. So
pre-calculation can be a better option if a very efficient solution is hard to find. But of course the most
obvious brute force method can take around 200 years to complete in a 1.8 Ghz Pentium IV machine.
