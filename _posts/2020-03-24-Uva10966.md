## Input

```
Mohammad: I cant continue. I give up!
Arash: Why?
Mohammad: cause I have read the obfuscated source-code of Unix BASH several times, and the more
I read the less I understand. Thats why I want to give up porting it to our own OS, 3KP.
Arash: Ok, Ok, just calm down. Let me think about it.

After several minutes of thinking . . .

Arash: Ok, why dont we write our own BASH! Trust me! We just need a small subset of the
functionalities in the BASH. So, lets write our own version.
Mohammad: No! No! Youre kidding!

Poor Mohammad! He has a lot of tasks to do. Besides a pile of books to study for his exams, he
should also make some problems for the local programming contest of their university. Considering
these tasks, Mohammad wonders whether he is able to accomplish this new task 

OK! Mohammad has found a solution. In fact, he has decided to out-source the 3KP-BASH project.
In other words, he would like to hire you as a professional programmer to write 3KP-BASH for him.

Problem Definition

The BASH environment for 3KP is intended to support only eight commands. The other function-
alities are decided to be available as stand-alone executable programs that can be run from our BASH
(Mohammad and Arash have already written the program execution codes, so you only have to add
support for these eight commands).

Before describing the supported commands, lets have a brief review of some basic things about 3KP
operating system.

 File System

 File: file is a simple object in this system. Each file has a name which is actually a string
consisting of English alphabetic characters, numeric characters, and . (dot) character. A
filename cannot contain two consecutive . characters. Also, the user cannot create a file
or directory with its name equal to a single .. A filename is no longer than 255 characters.
Note that filenames are case-sensitive. Each file has a size which is the amount of data in it.
The maximum allowed size for a file is 263. A file may also have some attributes. In the first
version of our BASH, we only need to know two of them which are directory and hidden
attributes.

 Directory: is simply a file with directory attribute and size of zero. In fact, a directory
is used as a logical place for keeping files. In other words, each directory may contain an
arbitrary number of files (or directories) inside it. An empty file system is assumed to have
only one directory which is called the Root Directory.

 Current Directory
At any time, there is a single directory which is assumed to be the default directory for programs
to use. This directory is called the Current Directory. When our BASH starts, it sets the current
directory to the root directory. A user may change the current directory during his works using
the facilities supplied by BASH.

 File and Directory Addressing

As you may know, there are many commands and programs which take a file or directory as their
input argument. So, we need to have a way to tell these programs exactly which file or directory
we would like them to perform some operations on. There are two methods for addressing a file
or directory:

 Full path addressing: In this method, all path elements are written from the root directory
with each two consecutive elements separated by a / character. For example, suppose we
have a directory named home in the root directory and inside home, there is another
directory named acm which itself contains a directory or file named uva. Using full-path
addressing, we should write [root]/home/acm/uva in order to address uva. For the sake of
simplicity, it is decided that [root] should be omitted from the above phrase thus resulting
in /home/acm/uva for full-path addressing uva.

 Relative Addressing: Suppose that in the above example, acm has two directories named
uva and avu and the user has set the current directory to avu. Now, if he/she wants to
address uva, in addition to full-path addressing, he has a simpler way which is by using
the string ../uva. In other words, a directory name of .. indicates the parent directory of
the current directory or the parent directory of the directory which is listed in the address
string exactly before its occurrence. So, in the example above, ../.. is equal to /home
and ../../../home/.. is equal to the root directory. Theres also another directory name
. which means the current directory. So, again in the example above, assuming that the
current directory is /home/acm, ./uva is equal to /home/acm/uva. Note that the user
have the choice to omit ./ from this kind of addresses. So, uva is exactly equal to ./uva.

Now that we know enough about the file system and addressing, we can see what the commands
are.

Commands



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10966  3KP-BASH Project 3/4

Usage Description
cd path cd is the simplest command in our system. cd changes the current directory to path which is

a directory addressed using either full-path or relative addressing methods. If path does not
exist, the error message path not found should be printed in the standard output.

touch filename
[-size] [-h]

touch command is used to create or modify a file. filename is actually a path with its last
element equal to the name of the file to be created. All the elements of the path except the
last element should form a valid address to an existing directory and the last element should
be a valid filename. If the indicated filename does not exist in the indicated path, a new file
is created with its size equal to size argument of the command. If the argument is not given
then the size of the newly created file is assumed to be equal to zero. Also -h argument tells
the bash to set the hidden attribute for the newly created file. In the case that the given
filename already exists in the indicated path, the file should be deleted and recreated with
the new arguments.
In the case that the indicated path of the file to be created does not exist, touch command
should print the error message path not found on the standard output. And in the case
that there exists a directory in the indicated path with the same name as the file to be
created, the error message a directory with the same name exists should be printed on
the standard output.

mkdir path
[-h]

Creates a directory with the address equal to path argument. The last element of the address
is the name for the new directory. The other elements of the address should form a valid
address and should address an existing directory. In the case that these elements do not
meet these conditions, the error message path not found should be printed in the standard
output. Also, if a file or directory exists in the given path with the same name as the directory
to be created, the error message file or directory with the same name exists should
be printed on the standard output.
Note that if -h is specified as an argument, then the newly created directory is given the
hidden attribute.

find filename
[-r] [-h]

Searches for files or directories. filename should be a valid address with the last element
equal to the name of the file or directory to be searched for. The other elements of the address
should address an existing directory which is the directory to be searched or else the error
message path not found is printed on the standard output. If -r is specified then all of the
directories inside the given address should also be searched recursively. By default, find does
not search within the files or directories having the hidden attribute unless -h is specified as
an argument.
For each file or directory found with the specified name, exactly one line is printed in the
standard output containing the full-path of the file or directory, its size, the word hidden if
the hidden attribute is set for the file and the word dir if the directory attribute is set for the
file. All these properties should be separated by single space characters. The results should be
sorted by lexicographical order of full-path addresses which means that in order to compare
two files, the path elements of their full-path addresses are lexicographically compared to each
other from left to right.
In the case no such file or directory is found, the error message file not found should be
printed on the standard output.

ls [path]
[-h] [-r]
[-s] [-S]
[-f] [-d]

ls is a very popular command used to list the contents of [part of] the file system. In its
simplest form, ls does not take any arguments. In this case, all of the files and directories in
the current directory that do not have the hidden attribute are listed in a similar format to
that of find command. In the case there is no such file or directory in the current directory,
it prints the message [empty].
If path is specified as an argument and is the address of an existing directory, then ls performs
its operation on path instead of the current directory.
Among the other arguments, if -h is specified, then the files and directories with hidden
attribute are also shown. In the case -r is specified, ls performs its operation on the directories
within the original directory to be searched recursively. If -s is specified, the results are first
sorted in non-decreasing order by size. There, in the case there are two files having the same
sizes, the two files should be ordered in a manner similar to find command.
As an argument, the functionality of -S is similar to -s instead of the fact that -S sorts the
files by size in non-increasing order. Argument -d forces ls to only show the directories in
the result while -f forces ls to only show the files that do not have the directory attribute.

pwd Prints the full-path address of the current directory on the standard output.
exit Terminates the session and exits BASH
grep string grep is a special command with a special usage form. In detail, it takes an string and searches

its standard input for all occurrences of that string and outputs all the lines of its standard
input that contain those occurrences on the standard output. In this special version of grep
in our BASH, the standard input can only be fed to it by the means of a technology named
piping. Piping is a technology that can be used to attach the standard output of one command
to the standard input of another one. In more details, all the outputs generated by the first
command are passed to the second command as standard input. Pipes can be used in the
form command1 | command2. Executing this phrase causes BASH to execute command1
first and then pass its standard output to command2 and execute command2 respectively.
So, to feed grep with some input, we should use pipes as stated above. For example, ls |
grep "acm" searches the result of ls command for any lines containing the word acm.

At last note that the mandatory arguments of all the commands should be passed with the specified
order but the optional arguments can be passed in any order. Any of the above commands if not used
according to the usage form specified, produce the error message bad usage on the standard output
e.g. if a command is passed extra or redundant arguments. Also, if a command is entered which is not
among the above commands, the error message no such command should be printed on the standard
output. Note that these two error messages cannot be piped to grep.

Now that you exactly know how our BASH works, in order to warm-up yourself for implementing
the real BASH, just write a program that simulates a chain of commands and produces outputs. It is
guaranteed that none of the commands have two (or more) type of errors simultaneously.

You are advised to read the sample input/output carefully to see how these commands work.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several work sessions. Each session consists of several lines, each containing a command
to be executed. Length of a line containing a command is no more than 2048 characters. Also, there
may be arbitrary number of space characters before and after the command and between its arguments.
Each session is terminated with an exit command. Input is terminated by end-of-file. You must
assume that in the beginning of each session, the default directory is the root directory and the file
system is empty.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each session, your program should produce the output of each command appearing on the input.

```

## Sample Output

```
pwd
cd acm
mkdir ./acm
ls ./acm
cd acm
pwd
touch acm -h -1000
cd ..
cd /
grep
ls -r -s
ls -r -h
find acm -h -r | grep "1000"
exit

```
