title: Uva 00913  Joana and the Odd Numbers
---


## Input

```text

Joana loves playing with odd numbers. In the other day, she started
writing, in each line, an odd number of odd numbers. It looked as follows:

1

3 5 7

9 11 13 15 17

19 21 23 25 27 29 31

...

On a certain line Joana wrote 55 odd numbers. Can you discover the
sum of the last three numbers written in that line? Can you do this more
generally for a given quantity of odd numbers?

Given the number N of odd numbers in a certain line, your task is to
determine the sum of the last three numbers of that line.
