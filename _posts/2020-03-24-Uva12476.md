title: Uva 12476  Fun with Binary Tree
---


```
Once upon a time there was a Froogrammer (a very special type of computer programmer), who fall
in love with binary trees. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two
child nodes, usually distinguished as left and right. In this problem you are requested to solve one
of his favorite games played in a binary tree. The game is played in the following way:

1. You will start the game from the root of a binary tree.

2. Then you will be given a set of instructions containing letter L or R.

3. After processing i-th instruction you will process (i+ 1)-th instruction.

4. After receiving an instruction you can either accept the instruction or reject it.

5. If you accept an instruction L it will move you to the left child of the current node and if it is
R than it will move you to the right child of the current node.

6. If there is no left child for an instruction L or right child for an instruction R, that instruction
will be considered as rejected. Thus you will remain on the same node you are in.

7. If you reject two consecutive instructions you will lose the game.

8. If you do not lose while processing all the instructions, you will be considered as the winner.

Given the description of the binary tree and the set of instructions S you need to process. You are to
write a program that will output Yes if you can win the game and No if you cannot win the game.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T (T  200), denoting the number of test cases. Each case starts with a
number N , total number of nodes in the tree (1  N  20000). Next N lines contains two numbers
L, R (2  L,R  N or L = 1 or R = 1). (L,R) in i-th line represents the 1-based index of node
that is the left child and right child of i-th node. If the value of L or R is -1 than there is no node
connected in that corresponding end. Next line will contain a string S (1  length(S)  40000).

Node 1 is the root node of the tree.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the case number in the following format Case x: y, where x is the case number
and y is Yes or No indicating whether it is possible for you to go through all the instructions following
the rules described in the problem statement. See the sample input/output for more details.
