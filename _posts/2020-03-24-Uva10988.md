```
All right, Im stumped... and I think Im supposed to be.

There is a funny transformation that you can do with a graph. We start with an undirected graph,
G, and build a new graph, H. G has n vertices and m edges. For each edge in G, we create a vertex
in H. Two vertices in H are connected by an edge if and only if their corresponding edges in G share a
vertex. H will have m vertices and p edges.

Thats easy. But what about reconstructing G, given H?
```

## Input

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with two lines
containing m (at most 320) and p. p lines follow, each containing two different vertices (numbered from
1 to m) in H which are connected by an edge.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by either yes or no, depending
on whether there exists some graph G that produces the given graph H.

```
