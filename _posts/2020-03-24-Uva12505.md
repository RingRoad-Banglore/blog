title: Uva 12505  Searching in sqrt(n)
---


## Input

```text
In binary, the square root of 2, denoted by sqrt(2), is an infinite number 1.0110101000001001111...

Given an integer n and a binary string (i.e. a string consisting of 0 and 1) S, your task is to find
the first occurrence of S in the fraction part (i.e. the part after the decimal point) of sqrt(n). In case
sqrt(n) is an integer, the fraction part is an infinite sequence of zeros.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains T (T  100), the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains an
integer n (2  n  1, 000, 000) and a binary string S with at most 20 characters.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the position of the first character in the first occurrence of S. The first digit after
the dot is at position 0. The answer is guaranteed to be no greater than 100.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
2 101
1202 110011

```
