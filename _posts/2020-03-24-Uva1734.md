## Input

```
You have N cards and each has an unique number between 1 and N written on it. In how many ways
can you select a non-empty subset of the cards such that the number written on any two of your selected
cards dont have any common digits?

For example, when N = 12, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 11}, {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12} are some valid selections. But
{1, 2, 10}, {2, 5, 12} are not allowed.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T (T  15) which is the number of test cases. Each of
the following T lines denote a test case, containing an integer N (1  N < 109).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the case number followed by the number of subsets modulo 1000000007.
