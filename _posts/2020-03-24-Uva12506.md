title: Uva 12506  Shortest Names
---


## Input

```
In a strange village, people have very long names. For example: aaaaa, bbb and abababab.

You see, its very inconvenient to call a person, so people invented a good way: just call a prefix of
the names. For example, if you want to call aaaaa, you can call aaa, because no other names start
with aaa. However, you cant call a, because two peoples names start with a. The people in the
village are smart enough to always call the shortest possible prefix. It is guaranteed that no name is a
prefix of another name (as a result, no two names can be equal).

If someone in the village wants to call every person (including himself/herself) in the village exactly
once, how many characters will he/she use?
```

## Output

```
The first line contains T (T  10), the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line of one
integer n (1  n  1000), the number of people in the village. Each of the following n lines contains a
string consisting of lowercase letters, representing the name of a person. The sum of lengths of all the
names in a test case does not exceed 1,000,000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the total number of characters needed.

```

## Sample Output

```
1
3
aaaaa
bbb
abababab

```
