title: Uva 12581  Divisibility

## Input

```text

You are in the system of N -dimensional infinite hyper-grid with each hyper cell having an integer. In
an N -dimensional grid the co-ordinates of a cell are denoted as (X1, X2, . . . , XN ). Any hyper cell with
at least one negative co-ordinate contains the value 0 (zero). The origin hyper cell (the one with all zero
co-ordinates) contains the value 1. The value of a hyper cell with co-ordinate (X1, X2, . . . , XN ) (with
all non-negative Xi) is the sum of the values in N hyper cells with co-ordinates (X1  1, X2, . . . , XN ),
(X1, X2  1, . . . , XN ), . . . , (X1, X2, . . . , XN  1). You are given the starting and ending co-ordinate of
a subhypercube. You need to compute how many hyper cells in this sub hypercube contain an integer
not divisible by a given prime P .
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains T (0 < T < 51) the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a
line containing N (0 < N < 8) the dimension of the hypercube and the prime P (1 < P < 20). The
second line contains N integers denoting the co-ordinate of the starting cell of the hypercube. The
third line contains N integers denoting the co-ordinate of the ending cell of the hypercube. All the
co-ordinates will be non negative integers with at most 15 digits.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the serial of output followed by the number of hyper cells in the given sub
hypercube that contains an integer not divisible by a given prime P . Since the result can be too big so
output the result modulo 1000000009. Look at the output for sample input for details.
