## Input

```

VLSI circuits are too complex to design without CAD tools since the complexity of many VLSI circuits
is in the order of millions of transistors today. In order to reduce the complexity of the design process
for a VLSI circuit, the whole process is broken into several intermediate phases. Among them is a
physical design phase. In the physical design phase, the basic components of the circuit are usually
thought of as rectangular modules. The physical design phase itself consists of several steps. One of the
steps, which is most crucial for the performance of the circuit, is a floorplan/placement step. Actual
floorplan/placement problem in the VLSI circuit design is very complex. However, here, you are asked
to deal with a simple version of the problem, in which each component of a VLSI circuit can be viewed
as a rectangle in the plane.

A simple version of the floorplan/placement problem is to place n rectangles in the plane in axis-
parallel orientation such that some given constraints are satisfied. Information about relative locations
among rectangles is given as constraints. Relative location means that rectangle Ri (1  i  n), should
be placed either below (or above) rectangle Rj (1  n  j), or to the left (or right) hand side of
rectangle Rj . For each rectangle Ri, the coordinates of its lower left corner and its upper right corner
are represented as (xlli , y

ll
i ) and (x

ur
i , y

ur
i ), respectively. That rectangle Ri is located below rectangle Rj

means yuri  y
ll
j . Similarly, that rectangle Ri is to the left of rectangle Rj means x

ur
i  x

ll
j . Notice that

each rectangle can be placed rotated by 90o. Figure 1 shows two example cases in which rectangle R1
is below rectangle R2.

Figure 1. Two example cases to illustrate R1 is below R2.

The constraints regarding relative locations among the rectangles are represented as a binary tree
called slicing tree. A slicing tree represents how the plane is partitioned and which rectangle should be
placed in each sub-region. Each internal node of the slicing tree is labeled as either H or V. Each external
node of the slicing tree is labeled with a rectangle identification number i (1  i  n). The label H or
V for an internal node means that the sub-region on the plane is partitioned either by a horizontal line
or by a vertical line. For example, if the slicing tree is as shown in Figure 2, it means that the plane
is partitioned by a horizontal line and that rectangle R1 should be placed below rectangle R2. Notice
that both of the placements shown in Figure 1 meet the constraint shown in Figure 2.

On the other hand, if the slicing tree is as shown in Figure 3, it means that the plane is partitioned
by a vertical line and that rectangle R1 should be placed to the left hand of rectangle R2.

Figure 3. Another example of slicing tree for 2 rectangles

If any internal node Nk in the slicing tree is labeled as H, all the rectangles belonging to the left
sub-tree rooted at Nk should be placed below any rectangles belonging to the right sub-tree rooted at
Nk. Similarly, if any internal node Nk in the slicing tree is labeled as V, all the rectangles belonging
to the left sub-tree rooted at Nk should be placed to the left of any rectangle belonging to the right
sub-tree rooted at Nk. For example, Figure 4 shows a slicing tree and two different corresponding
placements.

Let R denote the minimum rectangle which encloses all the n rectangles when a placement is
determined. Such enclosing rectangles corresponding to the placements shown in Figure 4 are shown
in Figure 5 with dotted lines.

Given information regarding a slicing tree and the rectangles dimensions, your program should
determine the location for each rectangle such that the placement meets the given constraints and such
that the area of the enclosing rectangle R is as small as possible. Notice that the area of the enclosing
rectangle R can be affected by the orientation of each rectangle.

## Output

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer n
(1  n  1, 000), where n is the number of rectangles. In the following lines, dimensions of n rectangles
are given, each line for each rectangle. The i-th (1  i  n) line contains two integers, w and h
(1  w, h  500), w for width and h for height of rectangle i. In the next line the information regarding
a slicing tree is given. The information is represented as a list consisting of 2n 1 items separated by
spaces, which is obtained by traversing the slicing tree in post-order. Each item of the list is either a
label for an internal node or for an external node. The label for an internal node is either H or V.
The label for an external node is an integer i (1  i  n), which is the rectangle identification number.

## Sample Input

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. For each test
case, find a placement such that the given constraints regarding relative locations among rectangles are
satisfied and the area of the enclosing rectangle R is as small as possible. Then print the area of the
rectangle R for each test case. You can assume that the resulting area of R is less than 109 for each
test case.

The following shows sample input and output for two test cases.
