title: Uva 12914  Sum of all permutations
---


## Input

```text
Toby is very bored because his father went to live to Brazil, so he decided to create a challenge that
might take a lot of time to solve. First he creates a function called
SadToby
that receives an array of integers called permutation and a number M as follows:

For every permutation of the numbers from 1 to N Toby needs to print the sum of SadToby function.
Toby needs to compute this result for every possible value of M between 1 and N . As each of this
values can be very large output the result modulo the prime p = 1711276033 = 225  51 + 1. Can you
help this cute dog with his task?
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with a line with one integers N .

 1  N  105

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a single line with N integers containing the required sum for every value of M
between 1 and N .
Explication:

Third case, first output number M = 1. Consider all permutations. If the first number is greater
than 1, then the loop will break in the beginning itself with output 0. There are a total of 6 distinct
permutations out of which 4 will give 0. The remaining 2 will fetch 1 each from the function. Thus the
answer is 2. For M = 2 its easy to check that the output is 9 and for M = 3 is 36.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1
2
3

```
