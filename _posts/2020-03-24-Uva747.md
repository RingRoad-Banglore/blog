## Input

```text
An important soccer match is about to begin between long time rival teams A and B. Team B won the
toss for the ball, so a player of team B is placed exactly at the center-field position, ready for the first
kick. In the defensive field of team A there is a number of players from that team in strategic positions,
but no other player from team B is in that area.

At that moment, the coach for team B realizes that, if his team could move the ball really fast, the
defence players of team A would have time to reach only a limited area around their original locations.
Hence, if he could compute the ideal location for his players so that they could take advantage of that
situation, performing the shortest sequence of kicks to reach the goal without entering the area covered
by a player of team A, then the only important thing to consider would be the initial positions of team
A players and their reachable areas.

Figure 1: Defensive field of team A.

Team B hires you to develop a computer
program to help their coach in such a situa-
tion. The defensive field of team A is repre-
sented by a square area in the XY plane, with
the center-field position at location (0, 0), and
the mid-field line coinciding with the X axis
as described in Figure 1. This square area is
partitioned into a grid with 2s squares in each
dimension (s is given), and the goal towards
which team B attacks is on the Y = 2s line,
occupying g squares to each side of the Y axis.

Team A players are located at grid intersec-
tions, and each one can intercept the ball if and
only if it enters any square within p around its
position, stopping the play (that is, each player
covers an area of (2p)2). No team player from
team A will be at a position to cover the center-
field, (0, 0).

Your program should identify if there is a
possibility of placing up to n players from team B (not including the center-field one) in grid inter-
sections, in order to move the ball from the center field position to the goal of team A, avoiding any
square of the grid reachable by a team A player. Assume that the ball can move only parallel to the X
or Y axis. If it is not possible, notify saying: Situation Impossible. If there is a solution, then your
program should output the solution that uses the minimum number of players (identifying the position
of the players). If there are more than one possible solutions, your program should output any solution
where the ball runs the shortest distance.

Assume that the ball can move over the border of the field, even over the border opposite to the
center field (if these borders are not covered by players of team A, of course).

## Output

```text
The input consists of a sequence of scenarios followed by a line starting with 0, which must not be
processed. Each scenario consists of one line containing four integers s, g, p and n, where

 s is the number of grid squares, in each side of the Y axis; assume 0 < s < 10.

 g is the size of the goal, in number of grid squares in each side of the Y axis; assume 0 < g < s.

 p is a players reach, in number of grid squares; assume 0 < p < s.

 n is the number of team A players in the defense field of team A; assume 0  n < 100.

These four integers are followed by a sequence of n pairs of integers defining the positions of team A
players in the defense field of team A. There may be any number of blank spaces (at least one) between
the numbers in the input.

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of a line identifying the scenario followed by a line saying either

 Situation Impossible, or

 Goal with k kicks: (x1, y1)(x2, y2) . . . (xk+1, yk+1), where (xi, yi), i  k, indicates the position
of the i-th player of team B to kick the ball to accomplish the goal in k plays, and (xk+1, yk+1) is
the final point the ball reaches (which should be over the goal line). Note that x1 = 0 and y1 = 0,
and yk+1 = 2s.

A blank line separates the output of two scenarios.
