## Input

```text
The Fibonacci number sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on. You can see that except the first two
numbers the others are summation of their previous two numbers. A Fibonacci Prime is a Fibonacci
number which is relatively prime to all the smaller Fibonacci numbers. First such Fibonacci Prime is
2, the second one is 3, the third one is 5, the fourth one is 13 and so on. Given the serial of a Fibonacci
Prime you will have to print the first nine digits of it. If the number has less than nine digits then print
all the digits.
