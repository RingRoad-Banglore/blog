485 Pascal’s Triangle of Death
In this problem, you are asked to generate Pascal’s Triangle. Pascal’s Triangle is useful in many areas
from probability to polynomials to programming contests. It is a triangle of integers with “1” on top
and down the sides. Any number in the interior equals the sum of the two numbers above it. For
example, here are the first 5 rows of the triangle.

1
1 1

1 2 1
1 3 3 1

1 4 6 4 1

In “Pascal’s Triangle of Death,” you are to generate a left justified Pascal’s Triangle. When any
number in the triangle is exceeds or equals 1060, your program should finish printing the current row
and exit. The output should have each row of the triangle on a separate line with one space between
each element.

The final element of each line should be directly followed by a newline. There is no space after the
last number on each line.
