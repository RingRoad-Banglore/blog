Bill is developing a new mathematical theory for human emotions. His recent investigations are dedi-
cated to studying how good or bad days influent peoples memories about some period of life.

A new idea Bill has recently developed assigns a non-negative integer value to each day of human
life. Bill calls this value the emotional value of the day. The greater the emotional value is, the better
the day was. Bill suggests that the value of some period of human life is proportional to the sum of the
emotional values of the days in the given period, multiplied by the smallest emotional value of the day
in it. This schema reflects that good on average period can be greatly spoiled by one very bad day.

Now Bill is planning to investigate his own life and find the period of his life that had the greatest
value. Help him to do so.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive test cases are
separated by a single blank line.

The first line of the input file contains n  the number of days of Bills life he is planning to
investigate (1  n  100000). The rest of the file contains n integer numbers a1, a2, . . . , an ranging
from 0 to 106  the emotional values of the days. Numbers are separated by spaces and/or line breaks.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

On the first line of the output file print the greatest value of some period of Bills life.
On the second line print two numbers l and r such that the period from l-th to r-th day of Bills

life (inclusive) has the greatest possible value. If there are multiple periods with the greatest possible
value, then print any one of them.
