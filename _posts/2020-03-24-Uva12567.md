title: Uva 12567  Never7 Ever17 and Water
---


```
Infinity is one of my favorite game series. If you have ever played Never7, youll know that Haruka,
Kurumi and Izumi all like water.

If you have ever played Ever17, youll know that the entire story of Ever17 happened under the sea.

So water is very important in these two games. Thats why I made this problem, in which you
need to design an amazing water system.

It is a circulation system (i.e. no source or sink of water) consisting of m pipes connecting n
junctions. No water is created or destroyed during circulation, so for each junction, the total amount
of water coming into it should be the same of the amount going out of it, for each unit time.

Pipes are deformable, so we can easily control the water speed through them. However, each pipe
has a pair of lower-bound and upper-bound, and the actual water speed through it must lie within the
bounds.

Pipes are transparent, so you can actually see how fast the water is going through each pipe. To
make it look beautiful, the water speed should be as balanced as possible. I.e. the difference between
the maximal water speed and the minimal water speed should be minimized.

Could you find the optimal design?

```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case begins with two integers
n and m (2  n  50, 1  m  200), the number of junctions and the number of pipes. Each of the
following m lines contains four integers u, v, b, c (1  u, v  n, u = v, 0  b  c  100), that means
there is a pipe connecting junction u and v, and the speed of water flowing from u to v, denoted by f ,
should satisfy b  f  c. Junctions are numbered 1 to n, and pipes are numbered 1 to m (in the same
order that they appear in the input). Note that the pipes need not be straight, so two junctions can
be connected by several pipes.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the minimal difference between the maximum speed and the minimum speed
to five decimal places. If there is no solution, print -1.
