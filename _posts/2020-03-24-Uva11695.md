title: Uva 11695  Flight Planning
---


## Input

```
The airline company NCPC Airways has flights to and from n
cities, numbered from 1 to n, around the entire world. However,
they only have n1 different flights (operating in both directions),
so in order to travel between any two cities you might have to
take several flights. In fact, since the management has made sure
that its possible to travel between any pair of cities, there is
exactly one set of flights a passenger have to take in order to
travel between two cities (assuming you want to use the same
airline).

Recently many of NCPC Airways frequent flyers have com-
plained that they have had to change flights too often to get to
their final destination. Since NCPC Airways doesnt want to loose their customers to other airline
companies, but still keep the nice property of their flights, they have decided to cancel one of their
current flights and replace it with another flight. Help the company by writing a program which finds
the best flight to cancel and the best new flight to add so that the maximum number of flight changes
a passenger might have to make when travelling between any pair of cities in which NCPC Airways
operates is minimized.

The input will be constructed so that it is always possible to improve the maximum number of flight
changes needed.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N < 20) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

The first line of input for each test case contains the integer n (4  n  2500), the number of cities
NCPC Airways operates in. Then follow n 1 lines specifying the flights. Each flight is given as a pair
of cities a and b (1  a, b  n).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print three lines of output. The first line should contain an integer, the minimum
number of flights needed to take when travelling between any pair of cities after changing one of the
flights. The second line should contain two integers, specifying the two cities between which the flight
should be canceled. The third line should contain two integers, specifying the two cities where a new
flight should be added.

If there are more than one optimal solution, any one of them will be accepted.
