## Input

```
Among other things, Computational Molecular Biology deals with processing genetic sequences. Con-
sidering the evolutionary relationship of two sequences, we can say that they are closely related if they
do not differ very much. We might represent the relationship by a tree, putting sequences from ancestors
above sequences from their descendants. Such trees are called phylogenetic trees.

Whereas one task of phylogenetics is to infer a tree from given sequences, well simplify things a bit
and provide a tree structure - this will be a complete binary tree. Youll be given the n leaves of the
tree. Sure you know, n is always a power of 2. Each leaf is a sequence of amino acids (designated by
the one-character-codes you can see in the figure). All sequences will be of equal length l. Your task is
to derive the sequence of a common ancestor with minimal costs.

Amino Acid
Alanine Ala A
Arginine Arg R
Asparagine Asn N
Aspartic Acid Asp D
Cysteine Cys C
Glutamine Gln Q
Glutamic Acid Glu E
Glycine Gly G
Histidine His H
Isoleucine Ile I

Amino Acid
Leucine Leu L
Lysine Lys K
Methionine Met M
Phenylalanine Phe F
Proline Pro P
Serine Ser S
Threonine Thr T
Tryptophan Trp W
Tyrosine Tyr Y
Valine Val V

The costs are determined as follows: every inner node of the tree is marked with a sequence of length
l, the cost of an edge of the tree is the number of positions at which the two sequences at the ends of
the edge differ, the total cost is the sum of the costs at all edges. The sequence of a common ancestor of
all sequences is then found at the root of the tree. An optimal common ancestor is a common ancestor
with minimal total costs.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and l, denoting the
number of sequences at the leaves and their length, respectively. Input is terminated by n = l = 0.
Otherwise, 1  n  1024 and 1  l  1000. Then follow n words of length l over the amino acid
alphabet. They represent the leaves of a complete binary tree, from left to right.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a line containing some optimal common ancestor and the minimal total costs.
