title: Uva 10445  Make Polygon
---


## Input

```text
Mr. Picasso is a geometry expert. Recently he invented a method
of drawing polygon. He starts with a point and draw a line seg-
ment from the end point of the previous line segment in such a
way so that except adjacent segments no two segments intersect.
He finishes drawing when he returns to the starting point. Such
a polygon is shown in the following figure.

In this problem you have to find the minimum and maximum
angle of Picassos polygon.
```

## Output

```text
Each input starts with an integer, N (3  N  20). In the
following N lines there are two integers indicating the Cartesian
coordinate of the end points of line segments drawn by Picasso.
The absolute value of each co-ordinate will not cross 1000. Input is terminated when N is less than 3.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input print the value of minimum and maximum angles of Picassos Polygon in degree.
Use 6 digits precision.

```

## Sample Output

```text
