title: Uva 11273  Warping of N Dimensional Space
---


## Input

```text
In this problem, we want to apply a linear
transformation to warp an N dimensional vol-
ume. Let V olume(v) denote the volume of the
N dimensional parallelepiped spanned by N , N
dimensional vectors {v1, v2, . . . , vN}. An exam-
ple of a 2D volume spanned by 2, 2 dimensional
vectors is shown below. In a strange twist, we
have decided to apply a Linear GCD trans-
formation. That is, if we represent our linear
transformation f : RN  RN by the matrix
A, where R denotes the set of real numbers,
then A(i, j) = gcd(i, j) for 1  i, j  N , where
gcd(i, j) stands for the greatest common divi-
sor of i and j. Given, S, any set of N vec-
tors of RN , such that V olume(S) is positive,
we ask you to compute the ratio of the vol-
ume after the transformation to the volume be-
fore the GCD Transformation. In other words,
compute r(S) = V olume(F (S))/V olume(S),
where F (S) = {f(v)|v in S}. However, since
r(S) can be quite large, we only ask you to com-
pute T (S) = floor(r(S)) mod 4000039. In an
even stranger twist, we will not give you S, but instead ask you to compute, the mean value of T (S)
over all N vectors S of RN , such that V olume(S) is positive.
