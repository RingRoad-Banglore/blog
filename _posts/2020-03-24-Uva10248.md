title: Uva 10248  The Integer Alltime Champ
---


## Input

```
As Alan Turing and his friend David Champernowne gave the name The All-time Champ number
(as a joke with the David surname) to the trascendental constant 0.1234567891011 . . . obtained by
concatenating the positive integers and interpreting them as decimal digits to the right of a decimal
point, let us nominate All-time Champ Integers to the numbers constructed by concatenating the
digits of a set of consecutive integers.

Given two natural numbers 0 < m  n, there is a such integer, but there are other natural numbers
that contain, as substrings, all the numbers between m and n, both included. For example for m = 1
and n = 13, possible solutions are 12345678910111213 (the corresponding Champ), 1011213456789
or 1101213456789. We can see that the last two numbers have only 13 digits as against the 17 of the
Champ.

Your task is to find out the shortest such integer.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains two natural numbers m and n(0 <
m  n < 100). Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contain the shortest integer that contains
as substring all the numbers between m and n (both included). There may be more than one solution.
We will accept any one of the solutions.

```

## Sample Output

```
1 13
1 4
13 14
11 12

```
