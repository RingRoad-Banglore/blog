## Input

```
Evolution is a seemingly random process which works in a way which resem-
bles certain approaches we use to get approximate solutions to hard combi-
natorial problems. You are now to do something completely different.

Given a DNA string S from the alphabet {A,C,G,T}, find the minimal
number of copy operations needed to create another string T . You may
reverse the strings you copy, and copy both from S and the pieces of your
partial T . You may put these pieces together at any time. You may only
copy contiguous parts of your partial T , and all copied strings must be used
in your final T . Example: From S = ACTG create T = GTACTATTATA

1. Get GT......... by copying and reversing TG from S.

2. Get GTAC....... by copying AC from S.

3. Get GTAC...TA.. by copying TA from the partial T .

4. Get GTAC...TAAT by copying and reversing TA from the partial T .

5. Get GTACAATTAAT by copying AAT from the partial T .
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives a single integer, 1  t  100, the number of test cases. Then follow, for
each test case, a line with the string S of length 1  m  18, and a line with the string T of length
1  n  18.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output for each test case the number of copy operations needed to create T from S, or impossible
if it cannot be done.
