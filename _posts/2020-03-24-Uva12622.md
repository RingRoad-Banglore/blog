title: Uva 12622  Fast Fouriest Transform
---


```
As everybody knows, every number can be transformed by means of using a different base to represent
it. We say that, for a particular number, a transform is fourier than other if the first one uses the digit
4 more times than the second one. Also, a fouriest transform of a number is one that uses the digit
4 as many times as possible (i.e., there is no transform fourier than it).

You have to write a program to find the smaller base that produces a fouriest transform for a
number.
```

## Input

```
The input format is as follows:

An integer in a single line which says the number of problems to solve. Then, for each problem, a
line with the integer number that has to be analyzed (smaller in absolute value than 1000000000).

```

## Output

```
The output for each problem consists of one line with three numbers separated by spaces: the analyzed
number, the number of fours in a fouriest transform of that number, and the minimum base of the
fouriest transform of the number.

If no transform can be found that uses the digit 4 to represent the number, then the output should
be X is infuriable. (where X is the analyzed number).

```

## Sample Input

```
4
4444
567
7895
7

```

## Sample Output

```
4444 4 10
567 2 7
7895 1 5
7 is infuriable.
```
