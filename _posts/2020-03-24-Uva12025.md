title: Uva 12025  Wrong Keys

## Input

```text
The ACME Publishing Company has bought thousands of cheap keyboards from ACM (A Computer
Manufacturer) and has given one to each of their authors. ACMEs writers are not great typists and
compose their exquisite novels typing with just one finger of each hand and carefully looking for each
one of the keys as they need to press it. As a result, they cannot look at the screen while they are
typing. Also, due to the tight deadlines imposed by ACME, the writers cannot revise what they write.

ACM keyboards were amazingly cheap, but that was only because they were slightly defective: each
keyboard had a couple of keys incorrectly placed.

For example, one of the keyboards had the b and t keys each placed where the other one should
be. So, if Shakespeare had used it to write Hamlet then the phrase Bo te or nob bo te would be quite
famous today.

Unfortunately, ACME didnt realize the problem until the authors sent several hundreds of novels
for publishing, each of them written with a keyboard that had a pair of keys misplaced. Since publishing
such gibberish is not acceptable even for ACME standards, they have decided to fix the novels before
printing them.

You have to write a program that will read the novels and decide how to fix each of them. For
that, it will decide which letters to switch so that the result contains as few different wrong words as
possible according to a dictionary.

## Output

```text
The input format is as follows:
An integer in a single line which says the number of problems to solve. Then, for each problem:

 An integer nw in a line of itself denoting the number of words in the dictionary.

 nw words, each in a single line. These words will be in lowercase and contain only the characters
quoted next: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'-.

 An integer nb in a line of itself telling the number of books to revise using the same dictionary.

 nb books. Each book starts with a line containing exactly the string .ONCE UPON A TIME.
and ends with a line containing exactly the string .THE END.. Books can contain any character
between those lines, but the words to be considered can contain only uppercase or lowercase
letters from a to z, hyphens (-) and apostrophes ('), and cannot start nor end with either
a hyphen or an apostrophe.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of one line for each book showing the two letters (from a to z) that should be
swapped in the text to obtain a text containing the minimum possible number of different words that
cannot be found in the dictionary, separated by a space and in alphabetic order. If there are several
minimum solutions, only the first one in lexicographic order should be shown.

The case of the letters of a word is not relevant when looking it up in the dictionary. The two letters
of the solution must be different.
