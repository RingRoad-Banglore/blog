title: Uva 12756  Flat Triangle
---


```

You are given the coordinates of a triangle lying on a 2D Cartesian plane. The whole plane can be
divided into square blocks of 1  1 size. Your job is to find out how many of the 1  1 square blocks
have at least 50% of its area inside the triangle.

The picture below shows a triangle where the vertices are at (0, 1), (9, 3) and (3, 8). And the
shaded squares are the squares with at least 50
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T ( 100) denoting the number of test cases. Each of
the following T lines contain six space separated integers x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 giving the coordinates of
the triangle. The given coordinates will form a valid triangle with positive area and all the coordinates
will be integers having values between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

```

## Output

```
For each input, print the output in the format Case X: Y  (here, X is the serial of the input and Y
is the number of squares which have at least 50% of its area inside the triangle).

```

## Sample Input

```
2

0 1 9 3 3 8

1 1 4 1 1 4

```

## Sample Output

```

Case 1: 29

Case 2: 6
