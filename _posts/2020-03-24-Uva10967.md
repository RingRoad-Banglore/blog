## Input

```
Poor Kianoosh! 6 weeks since he was officially accepted as a citizen of Barareh and during this time
he has had nothing but Nochophskew for his breakfast, lunch and dinner. And nowadays, during the
nights, he dreams of nothing but a small piece of bread, some cheese and a glass of milk to have for his
breakfast. And during the days, he thinks of nothing but a great escape from this weird city in order
to turn his night-time dreams into reality.

After carefully checking all the potential ways out of the city, he concluded that there are only three
such possible ways. The first one is through the city gate which is of course guarded by fully-armed
guards, ready to kill any creature trying to go through the gate without permission. The second way
is passing through the northern walls of the city and going through a jungle which contains nothing
but those deadly snakes called NeshimanGazes (And be sure that Kianoosh does not like to repeat his
creepy experience with them again).

Finally, the third and the last (and of course the only feasible) way is passing through a secret door
in the famous so called HezarDaroon Castle (means a castle with thousands of doors). Unfortunately,
the problem with this castle is that no one actually knows the way to reach this secret door.

After spending some time gathering information about the castle, Kianoosh found out that HezarDa-
roon can actually be modeled as an mn grid with each cell representing a room in the castle. There is
always a door between two neighboring rooms but there are some rooms which contain a NeshimanGaz
ready to serve anyone trying to enter the room with its poisonous bites.

Figure 1. A Room containing a Rotating Door

There are also some rooms which contain
a rotating door. A rotating door is actually a
cylinder positioned at the center of the room
with a slice removed from it. In Figure 1, you
can see a room with a rotating door with its
removed slice facing towards west.

As it can be seen, one can only enter the
room from the neighbor to which the removed
slice is facing. And once Kianoosh enters the
room, he can rotate the door clockwise or
counter-clockwise in order to reach the other
doors in the room. For example, in the config-
uration of figure 1, if he rotates the door clock-
wise by 90 degrees, he can reach the door to
the north and if he continues rotating the door
by another 90 degrees in the same direction, he
can reach the door to east.

Another important fact about the rotating doors is that associated to each door is a number d which
is the amount of time, measured in seconds, that it takes for a normal human-being(like Kianoosh) to
rotate the door by 90 degrees. You may also assume that going from a room to its neighbor room takes
exactly 1 second.

Today, after spending a noticeable amount of money, Kianoosh managed to buy a map of the castle
from underground shops of Barareh. Taking a look at the map, he found that the entrance to the castle
is located at the lower-left corner and the secret door is located at the upper-right corner of the grid.
He can also see the position and the initial configuration of the rotating doors and the coordinates of
rooms containing the deadly NeshimanGazes to which Kianoosh does not like to enter.

Kianoosh is happy. He is only one step away from his dreams coming true. But how can he find his

way to the secret door? Yes! He needs help! And as a genius problem-solver, you should help him find
the path with the minimum required time to reach the secret passage from the lower-left corner of the
castle.

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T  100 which is the number of test cases. Each test
case begins with a line containing 1  n  100 (the number of rows) and 1  n  100 (the number
of columns) followed by m lines, with the ith line containing n characters, the jth character of which
representing the status of the jth cell in the ith row of the grid (counted from north). Each character
may have six different values. A . character represents a normal room while a # represents a room
containing a NeshimanGaz and N, W, E, S represent a room with a rotating door facing north, west,
east, and south respectively. The map is followed by D integers, the kth of which is equal to dk for the
kth door, counting the doors from the north-west corner in a row major order. You can assume that
D (which is the number of rotating doors in the castle) is no more than 500, and the entrance (room
at lower-left corner) and the room containing the secret door (room at upper-right corner) does not
contain NeshimanGazes or rotating doors.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, your program should output a line containing a single integer which is the minimum
amount of time required for Kianoosh to reach the secret door. In the case the secret door is not
reachable with respect to the given map and rules, a line containing the phrase Poor Kianoosh should
be printed.
