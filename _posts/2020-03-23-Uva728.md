728 Scatter Point Plot
This problem deals with generating a plot of points that fit on the display screen. The Y axis is vertical
and contains 20 lines (one Y value for each row); the X axis is horizontal and contains 12 positions
(each X value takes 5 columns).

## Input
Input consistes of several datasets. The first line of the input indicates the number of test cases. The
second line is void, and the datasets follow. Each dataset is defined as follows:

1st line low X value and X axis increment
2nd line low Y value and Y axis increment

Followed by one X value and one Y value per line.
They will be positive integers up to 4 digits.

There is a blank line between datasets.

## Output
For each dataset, character display a X,Y plot including grid lines and axis labelling as shown in the
sample below. Print Y -values right-justified in a field of width 4 and ‘:’ in column number five. None
of the lines in the output file will contain trailing blanks. That is, every line will end with the last
non-blank character in it.

All pairs of X,Y values will be inputted and the lowest and highest needs to be found to determine
scaling values. The increment for each row or column will be based on 20 positions for the Y axis and
12 for the X axis. When establishing what position a value will fall on rounding is to be done up at
the halfway point to the next increment value.

If only one X,Y value falls at a particular point display the character ‘1’. If two X,Y values fall
at a particular point display the character ‘2’; if three X,Y values fall at a particular point display the
character ‘3’; etc.

In case that there were ten or more X,Y values falling at a point, the numbers have to be centered
on the cross-marks in the following way:

1000
100
10
1

Print a blank line between datasets.
