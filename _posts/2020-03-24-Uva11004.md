title: Uva 11004  Changing Roadmap
---


## Input

```text
Like many other cities Texas is now facing trouble with excessive traffic flow and hence traffic Jam.
That is why the Governor of Texas is planning to build many new roads. The roads of Texas can be
considered as straight lines, and they are in general position, which means that no two roads are parallel
and no three roads are concurrent. Roads are denoted by three integers a, b, c, which actually denotes
a road with equation the ax+ by+ c = 0 in a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. New roads
will be build in Texas according to the following plan:

a) The city authority has identified PP very important places. These places can be considered as
points in a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. New roads will be built from all the
existing junctions (where two roads intersect) to all the important places. So JJ PP new roads
will be built, where JJ is the number of junctions. So all these new roads will be straight-line
segments, each of them connecting one junction and one very important place.

b) Suppose the equation of the i-th and j-th road (j > i) is aix+ biy+ ci = 0 and ajx+ bjy+ cj = 0.
Then the roads connecting the junction of these two roads and any important place will be of the
form aix + biy + ci + k(ajx + bjy + cj) = 0. If k is positive, then the road is built by Positive
Builders Ltd, and if k is negative then the road is built by Negative Builders Ltd.

Figure: A typical roadmap with four roads, two important places and six junctions. So the number of
new roads to be built is 2*6=12

Given the equation of N existing roads of Texas, your job is to find out how many of the roads will
be built by the Negative Builders Ltd.

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 12 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with an integer N (0 < N  3000), which denotes the number of existing roads in
Texas. Each of the next N lines contains three integers ai, bi, ci (1  i  N and 10000  ai, bi, ci 
10000), which actually denotes that the i-th street has an equation aix + biy + ci = 0. The next line
contains an integer PP (1  P  100), which indicates the number of very important places. Each of
the next PP lines contains two integers xi, yi that indicates the coordinates of the i-th important place
is (xi, yi). No important places will be on the existing roads.

Input is terminated by a block whose first line contains a zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce two lines of output. The first line contains the serial of the roadmap and
the second line reports how many of new roads, will be built by the Negative Builders Ltd. Look at
the output for sample input for the exact format.
