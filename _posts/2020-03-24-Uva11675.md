title: Uva 11675  Happy Friends

## Input

```text
The happiness of your friends makes you happier, and this increase of your happiness also has impact
on your friends happiness. What if no other effect (like dissatisfaction, poverty, enmity etc.) exits?
The happiness would always increase day by day in a friendship network.

Can you help to analyze the scenario if only happiness exists in a friendship network? You are given
a friendship network of N friends. You can identify them by integers from 0 to N  1. You are also
given M pairs of integer. Each pair represents a friendship between two persons in that network. You
are also given a person who is the first happy person in the network. The initial degree of happiness
of that first person is 1. Initial degree of happiness of all others in that friendship network is 0. The
network will be given in such a way that each persons degree of happiness will be affected after a
certain period by the initial happy person.

Can you answer, what will be the degree of happiness of all of N persons in that network after D
days if the degree of happiness of each person increases by a defined rule?

The only simple rule is: Each day, a persons degree of happiness is increased if and only if his degree
of happiness is not increased in previous day. If the degree of happiness is not increased in previous
day then it will increased by the summation of degree of happiness of all of his friends at previous day.

To make it more clear, let us consider a person p, and his degree of happiness is not increased at d-th
day, so his degree of happiness will increase at (d+ 1)-th day by the summation of degree of happiness
of all of his friends at d-th day. But if his degree of happiness increased at d-th day, it will remain same
after (d+ 1)-th day.

## Output

```text
Input will start with an integer T (1  T  200), number of test cases. Each case starts with
four integers N (1  N  30), M (N  1  M  N  (N  1)/2), K (0  K  N  1) and D
(0  D  1000000000), number of nodes, number of friendships, initial happy person and number of
days. Each of the next M lines will contain two integers u and v (0  u, v  N  1, u = v), which
represents that u and v are friends.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a single line providing the case number followed by N space separated integers.
The i-th integer represents the degree of happiness of i-th person after D days. The degree of happiness
can be very large so that you should output the value of degree of happiness modulo 1000000007.

See sample input and output for exact format.
