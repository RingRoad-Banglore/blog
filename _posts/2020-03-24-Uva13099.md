title: Uva 13099  Tobby and the line game
---


## Input

```
Tobby the pet enjoys a lot going to the circus and he likes to take part in the games available for smart
pets like him. This time a new circus has just arrived to Tobbys town and they are promoting a new
game called the line game.

The line game is a very simple game played over a rectangular field whose lower left corner is
pL = (xL, yL) and its upper right corner is pR = (xR, yR). In one game there are multiple players and
each of them have to throw two coins over the game field. The games goal is to make the line joining
the places where the two coins landed as large as possible. The player who manages to make the longest
line from his threw coins is the winner of the game and therefore the winner of a big prize as well.

Tobby has been watching some rounds of the line game and he is wondering which are the chances
for him to win this game. He knows that he can barely throw the coins with his dogs paws so it can
be assumed that all the points over the game field are equally probable for the coins to land and it can
also be assumed that the two throws are independent. However, Tobby is so skilled that you can be
sure his coins will always land inside the game field or over its boundaries. Tobby wants to compute
the expected value of the squared length of the resulting line since this result can help him to make a
choice about whether or not he should take part in the line game. Can you help him?

For this problem the coin landing locations can be assumed to be 2D points over a continuous plane.
Suppose that the first coin landed at p1 = (x1, y1) and the second at p2 = (x2, y2) so Tobby is interested
in computing the expectation over p1  p22 = (x1  x2)2 + (y1  y2)2.

The input file contains several test cases. Each test case comprises 4 integer numbers, namely xL, yL,
xR and yR which represent the rectangular field as described above. The end of the input file will be
given by EOF.

Constraints:

 500  xL, yL, xR, yR  500

 xL < xR

 yL < yR
