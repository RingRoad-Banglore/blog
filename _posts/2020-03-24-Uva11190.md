title: Uva 11190  Series of Powers
---


## Input

```text
In this problem the summation of series of powers is defined as below:

S(l, h, k) = lk + (l + 1)k + (l + 2)k + . . . (h 1)k + hk

Given the value of l, h and k your job is to find the value of S(l, h, k)
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains around 1500 lines of inputs. Each line contains three integers l, h (0  l  h 
15000000 and |l h|  1000) and k (1  k  15000000). Input is terminated by a line containing three
minus 1.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output (printed in
field width of four) followed by the approximate value of S(l, h, k). This approximate value should be
of the form 0.ddddddedddddddddd. The value of mantissa is always less than 1 and has six digits after
the decimal point. If value of the exponent is irrelevant (Does not effect the value of the number) set
its value as 1. Follow the exact formatting shown in the sample output. Small precision errors (less
than 104) are allowed for the value of Mantissa.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1 10 10
10 15 100
-1 -1 -1

```
