title: Uva 00438  The Circumference of the Circle
---


## Input

```text
To calculate the circumference of a circle seems to be an easy task  provided you know its diameter.
But what if you dont?

You are given the cartesian coordinates of three non-collinear points in the plane.
Your job is to calculate the circumference of the unique circle that intersects all three points.
```

## Output

```text
The input file will contain one or more test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing six
real numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, representing the coordinates of the three points. The diameter of the
circle determined by the three points will never exceed a million. Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print one line containing one real number telling the circumference of the circle
determined by the three points. The circumference is to be printed accurately rounded to two decimals.
The value of  is approximately 3.141592653589793.
