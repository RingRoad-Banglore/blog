title: Uva 11640  Mayor Election
---


## Input

```text
Somewhere in this universe, there is a city named Shohor. The people of
Shohor are very democratic in nature. They will be holding their mayor
election in a few months. So, all the mayor candidates are starting their
campaign. All the candidates wanted to use posters in their campaigns,
so they requested the election commission (EC) to permit them to put
posters. After a long discussion, the election commission decided that,
the candidates will be permitted to put posters along the road SAH
Shoroni. But, the number of posters a particular candidate can place,
is limited by the commission.

All the posters are of size 1meter-by-1meter. The posters have to
be placed side-by-side, so, if someone puts K posters, they will take K
meters along the road.

Total length of SAH Shoroni is L meters. The candidates (and also
the EC) want to use every inch of the road. So, the total number of
posters along the road will always be the length of the road. Although,
every candidate should be given permission to place same number of
posters, some of them are very influential, and somehow managed to
change the number of posters they can place (I said they were demo-
cratic, I never mentioned whether they were corrupt or not). For each
candidate, the commission has decided that, he will be given a region of length at least li and at most
ui. But no matter, how long, each candidate is allowed to cover with posters, they all sum up to the
length of the road.

The Election Commission Office is at one end of the road. So, any position in the road can be
described the its distance from the office. Each candidate will be given a region [ai, bi] so that, he can
place his posters in between this region. For all the candidates, the regions are non-overlapping, and
completely covers the road.

All the candidates have a number of different posters. If people see same posters over and over, it
will become boring to them, so, they decided that, for any poster pi, it can be showed at most ci times,
consecutively.

No two candidates have same poster (Duh! obviously. You wont expect anyone to campaign for his
opponent!).

The citizen of Shohor knows the length of the road. They also know, that, the EC will permit
i-th candidate to place at least ai posters and at most bi posters. The assignments of the regions will
be done accordingly, that means, the posters nearest to the Election Commission office, will belong to
candidate 1, then next region will belong to the candidate 2, and so on. Help the citizen of Shohor find
the number of different poster sequence they will see.

## Output

```text
First line of input will contain an integer T (T  3), the number of test cases. This will be followed
by T test cases, each preceded by a blank line. Each test case, starts with an integer N (N  50), the
number of mayoral candidates. This will be followed by N lines, each describing a candidate. Each
candidate description will start with three integers, Pi (Pi  10), li and ui (0  li  ui  2000),
the number of different posters, the minimum number of posters, he will be allowed to place, and the
maximum number of posters he will be allowed. This will be followed by Pi integers, cj (1  cj  10),
the maximum number of times, j-th poster can be placed consecutively. After that, an integer Q



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 11640  Mayor Election 2/2

(Q  100000) describes the number of queries to handle. Each of the following Q lines each contain an
integer L (1  L  100000), the length of the road.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query, output the number of ways to cover the road with posters completely. The answer can
be really large. So, answer all number modulo 786433, which is also a prime number. For exact formats
please see the sample input output. There will be a blank line after each test case.
