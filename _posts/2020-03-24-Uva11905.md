## Input

```text
Given a model of a map in a 2D grid, you have to color the map satisfying certain constraints.

1) A map contains one or more regions. Each region is identified by an uppercase English letter Li.
In the grid, there will be some cells containing Li to form the region. From any cell of that region,
its possible to go to all cells (in that region) using adjacent moves. Adjacent move means going
to a cell which shares a side with the current cell and belongs to the same region.

2) A region Q may be surrounded by another region P. In such case, Q is called a sub-region of
P and Q may be erased from the map. Mark all the cells that are surrounded by P with Ps
identifier letter.

3) All regions that are not surrounded by other regions should be colored, but two adjacent regions
shouldnt be colored using the same color.

4) Two regions A and B are said to be adjacent if there is a cell of region A, and a cell of region B,
share a side.

5) If two cells of a region share a corner, then there will always be at least one cell which shares sides
with both the cells.

Now your job is to find the minimum number of different colors you need to color the map.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input will contain T ( 100) denoting the number of cases.

Each case starts with two integers m and n (5  m,n  50) denoting the number of rows and
columns respectively. Each of the next m lines contains n characters each. Each character will be
either a . or any uppercase English letter. . means empty place, and letters represent regions as
described above. You can assume that the input data satisfies the above constraints.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number and the minimum number of colors. Print m lines, each line with
n characters showing the final grid after erasing sub-regions and filling the surrounding cells.

```
