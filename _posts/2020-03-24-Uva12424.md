title: Uva 12424  Answering Queries on a Tree
---


```
Youare given a tree with N nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to N and have colors C1, C2,
, CN initially. You have to handle M instructions on the tree of the following forms:

 0 u c: Change the color of node u to c.

 1 u v: Output the maximum number of times a color appeared on the unique path from node u
to node v.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains T (1  T  10) which is the number of test cases. The first line of
each test case contains two integers N and M (1  N,M  105). Next line contains N space separated
integers C1, C2, , CN (1  Ci  10) denoting the initial colors of the nodes. Each of the next N  1
lines contain two integers a and b (1  a, b  N and a = b) meaning that there is an edge between
node a and node b. Each of the next M lines contains an instruction of one of the two forms described
above. For all the instructions: 1  u, v  N and 1  c  10.

```

## Output

```
For each of the second type instruction output the answer in one line.
