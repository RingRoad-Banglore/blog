## Input

```text

2

X 1

A team of up-to four robots is going to deliver parts in
a factory floor. The floor is organized as a rectangular
grid where each robot ocupies a single square cell. Each
robot is represented by an integer from 1 to 4 and can
move in the four orthogonal directions (left, right, up,
down). However, once set in motion, a robot will stop
only when it detects a neighbouring obstacle (i.e. walls,
the edges of the factory or other stationary robots).
Robots do not move simultaneously, i.e. only a single
robot moves at each time step.

The goal is to compute an efficient move sequence
such that robot 1 reaches a designed target spot; this
may require moving other robots out of the way or to
use them as obstacles for ricocheting moves.

Consider the example given above, on the right,
where the gray cells represent walls, X is the target
location and 1, 2 mark the initial positions of two robots. One optimal solution consists of the six
moves described below.

1
X
1 moved up.

2 X

2 moved right, down and left.
2 1

1 moved down and left.

Note that the move sequence must leave robot 1 at the target location and not simply pass through
it (the target does not cause robots to stop  only walls, edges and other robots).

Given the description of the factory floor plan, the initial robot and target positions, compute the
minimal total number of moves such that robot 1 reaches the target position.

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line contains the number of robots n, the width w and height h of the factory floor in cells,
and an upper-bound limit  on the number of moves for searching solutions.

The remaining h lines of text represent rows of the factory floor with exactly w characteres each
representing a cell position:

W a cell occupied by a wall;

X the (single) target cell;

1,2,3,4 initial position of a robot;

. an empty cell.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output should be the minimal number of moves for robot 1 to reach the target
location or NO SOLUTION if no solution with less than or equal the given upper-bound number of moves
exists.
