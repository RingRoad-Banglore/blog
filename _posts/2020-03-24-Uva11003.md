title: Uva 11003  Boxes
---


```
We have some boxes numbered 1 to N . The dimensions of all boxes are identical. Now we have to
stack up some of the boxes, subject to the following constraints:

1. One cannot put more than one boxes directly upon a box;

2. Boxes with lower serial numbers are not to be put upon one with a higher number;

3. The weight and maximum load for each box are given. The total weight of all boxes upon a box
should not exceed its maximum load.

Please write a program that finds the maximum number of boxes that can be stacked up according
to the above constraints.
```

## Input

```
The first line of each set of input is an integer N (1  N  1000). This is followed by N lines, each
with two integers, both  3000, representing the weight and maximum load of each box respectively.

Input ends with a case where N = 0.

```

## Output

```
Each line of your output should give the number of boxes that can be stacked up.
