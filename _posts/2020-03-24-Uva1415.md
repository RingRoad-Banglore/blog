title: Uva 01415  Gauss Prime
---


```

In the late 1700s, Gauss, a famous mathematician, found a special kind of numbers. These integers
are all in the form: a + b


k. The sum and multiplication of these integers can be naturally defined

as the follows:

(a+ b

k) + (c+ d


k) = (a+ c) + (b+ d)


k

(a+ b

k)  (c+ d


k) = (a  c = b  d  k) + (a  d+ b  c)


k

One can prove that the sum and multiplication of these integers constitute the structure called
imaginary quadratic field in calculus.

In case k = 1, these are common complex numbers.

In case both a and b are integers, these numbers are called Gauss integers, and this is the very
case that interests people the most in quadratic algebra.

As we all know that every integer can be factorized into the multiplication of several primes (Fun-
damental theorem of arithmetic, or unique factorization theorem).

Primes are the integers that can only be divided by 1 and itself. We do have a similar concept in
the context of Gauss integer.

If a Gauss integer cannot bee factorized into the multiplication of other Gauss integers (0, 1, -1
exclusive), we call it a Gauss Prime or Non-divisible.

Please note that 0, 1 and -1 are not regarded as gauss primes but

k is.

However, unique factorization theorem doesnt apply to arbitrary k. For example in the case k = 5,
6 can be factorized in two different ways: 6 = 2  3, 6 = (1 +


5)  (1


5).

Thanks to the advance of mathematics in the past 200 years, one can prove that there are only 9
integers can be used as k, such that the unique factorization theorem satisfies. These integers are

k  {1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163}

## Input

```
The first line of the input is an integer n (1 < n < 100), followed by n lines. Each line is a single case
and contains two integers, a and b (0  a  10000, 0 < b  10000).

```

## Output

```
To make this problem not too complicated, we just suppose that k is 2.

For every case of the input, judge whether a+ b

2 is a gauss prime.

Output the answer Yes or No in a single line.

Sample Explanation

Please note that (5, 1) is not a gauss prime because (5, 1) = (1,1)  (1, 2).
