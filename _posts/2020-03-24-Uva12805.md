## Input

```
For many many years, mathematicians all over the world have focused their attention on one of the
most fascinating phenomenon of Maths: the relationship between the perimeter and the diameter of a
circumference ().

Using one of Eulers formulas, we can calculate  as an addition of infinite terms,

 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/9 1/10 + 1/11 + 1/12 1/13 + . . .

Some of these terms add on, and others subtract, according to the following rules,

 You put + if the denominator of the fraction is 2.

 You put + if the denominator of the fraction is a prime like 4m 1, for some integer m.

 You put  if the denominator of the fraction is a prime like 4m+ 1, for some integer m.

 If the denominator is not a prime number, you put the sign resultant of multiplying the signs
corresponding to each prime factor.

For example, the term with denominator 3 has + because 3 is prime and 3 = 4 1 1. The term
with denominator 13 has  because 13 is prime and 13 = 4  3 + 1. The term with denominator 6
has + because 6 = 2  3, and 2 and 3 have respectively +. And the term with denominator 10 has
 because 10 = 2 5, and 2 has + and 5 has . So, 50 is 5 5 2, i.e., + = +.

We want to obtain the sign of the i-th term of the former Eulers formula, i.e., the sign of the term
with denominator i.

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer, t, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case,
one line appears containing an integer i, 2  i  100000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case the output should contain a single line, indicanting the sign of the term 1/i of Eulers
formula (+ or -).
