## Input

```text
Korea has many tourist attractions. One of them is an archipelago (Dadohae in Korean), a cluster of
small islands scattered in the southern and western coasts of Korea. The Korea Tourism Organization
(KTO) plans to promote a new tour program on these islands. For this, The KTO wants to designate
two or more islands of the archipelago as a tour belt.

There are n islands in the archipelago. The KTO focuses on the synergy effect created when some
islands are selected for a tour belt. Synergy effects are assigned to several pairs of islands. A synergy
effect SE(u, v) or SE(v, u) between two islands u and v is a positive integer which represents a value
anticipated when both u and v are included in a tour belt. The KTO wants to select two or more
islands for the tour belt so that the economic benefit of the tour belt is as high as possible.

To be precise, we define a connected graph G = (V,E), where V is a set of n vertices and E is a set
of m edges. Each vertex of V represents an island in the archipelago, and an edge (u, v) of E exists if
a synergy effect SE(u, v) is defined between two distinct vertices (islands) u and v of V . Let A be a
subset consisting of at least two vertices in V . An edge (u, v) is an inside edge of A if both u and v are
in A. An edge (u, v) is a border edge of A if one of u and v is in A and the other is not in A.

A vertex set B of a connected subgraph of G with 2  |B|  n is called a candidate for the tour belt
if the synergy effect of every inside edge of B is larger than the synergy effect of any border edge of B.
A candiate will be chosen as the final tour belt by the KTO. There can be many possible candidates
in G. Note that V itself is a candidate because there are no border edges. The graph in Figure 1(a)
has three candidates {1,2}, {3,4} and {1,2,3,4}, but {2,3,4} is not a candidate because there are inside
edges whose synergy effects are not larger than those of some border edges. The graph in Figure 1(b)
contains six candidates, {1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}, {7,8}, {3,4,5,6} and {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. But {1,2,7,8} is not
a candidate because it does not form a connected subgraph of G, i.e., there are no edges connecting
{1,2} and {7,8}.

The KTO will decide one candidate in G as the final tour belt. For this, the KTO asks you to find
all candidates in G. You write a program to print the sum of the sizes of all candidates in a given
graph G. For example, the graph in Figure 1(a) contains three candidates and the sum of their sizes
is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8, and the graph in Figure 1(b) contains six candidates and the sum of their sizes is
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 20.

## Output

```text
Your program is to read input from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of
test cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers
n (2  n  5, 000) and m (1  m  n(n1)

2
), where n represents the number of vertices (islands) and

m represents the number of edges of a connected graph G. Islands are numbered from 1 to n. In the
following m lines, the synergy effects assigned to m edges are given; each line contains three integers,
u, v, and k (1  u = v  n, 1  k  105), where k is the synergy effect between two distinct islands u
and v, i.e., SE(u, v) = SE(u, v) = k.
