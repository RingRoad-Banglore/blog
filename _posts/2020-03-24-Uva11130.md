title: Uva 11130  Billiard bounces
---


## Input

```
On a billiard table with a
horizontal side a inches long
and a vertical side b inches
long, a ball is launched from
the middle of the table with
initial velocity v inches per
second and launching angle A between 0 and 90 degrees measured counter-clockwise from the hori-
zontal.

Assume that collisions with a side are elastic (no energy loss), and thus the absolute value of a
velocity component of the ball parallel to each side remains unchanged after the bounce. However, due
to friction the ball decelerates at a constant rate and comes to a full stop after s > 0 seconds. Assume
the ball has a radius of zero. Remember that, unlike pool tables, billiard tables have no pockets.

How many times will the ball touch the vertical walls and how many times will the ball touch the
horizontal walls? If the ball touches a corner it means that it touched both a horizontal and a vertical
wall.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of a sequence of lines, each containing five nonnegative integers separated by whitespace.
The five numbers are: a > 0, b > 0, v > 0, 0  A  90, and s > 0, respectively.

Input is terminated by a line containing five zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input line except the last, output a line containing two integer numbers separated by a single
space. The first number says how many times the ball touched vertical walls and the second number
says how many times the ball touched horizontal walls.

```

## Sample Output

```
100 50 10 90 10
