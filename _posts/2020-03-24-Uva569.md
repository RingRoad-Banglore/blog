title: Uva 00569  Horse Shoe Scoring
---


## Input

```text
The game of horseshoes is played by tossing horseshoes at a post that is driven into the ground. Four
tosses generally make up a game. The scoring of a toss depends on where the horseshoe lands with
respect to the post. If the center of the post is within the region bounded by the interior of the
horseshoe and the imaginary line connecting the two legs of the horseshoe, and the post is not touching
the horseshoe, it is a ringer and worth five points. If any part of the horseshoe is touching the post,
it is a toucher and worth 2 points. If the toss is neither a ringer nor a toucher and some part of the
horseshoe will touch the post when it is pivoted around its point B, it is a swinger and worth 1 point.
Any horseshoe which does not fit any of the scoring definitions scores zero points. See the figures below
for examples of each of the scoring possibilities.

This program uses mathematical horseshoes that are semicircles with radius 10 centimeters. The
location of the horseshoe is the given by two points: the centerpoint of the semicircle, measured in
centimeters relative to x and y axes, and the point that exactly bisects the semicircle. The post is at
location (0, 0) and is 2 centimeters in diameter. The top of the post is level with the ground allowing the
horseshoe to lay on top of the post; therefore, a toucher would mean that any part of the horseshoe
lies within the circle with a radius of 1 centimeter centered at (0, 0).

Each turn consists of four tosses. The purpose of your program is to determine the score of the
turn by computing the sum of the point values for each of the four tosses.

## Output

```text
Input to your program is a series of turns, and a turn consists of four horseshoe positions. Each line of
input consists of two coordinate pairs representing the position of a toss. Each coordinate consists of a
floating point (X,Y ) coordinate pair (100.0  X,Y  100.0) with up to 3 digits of precision following
the decimal point; the first and second numbers are the X and Y coordinates of the centerpoint of
the horseshoe semicircle (Point A) and the third and fourth numbers are the X and Y coordinates of
the point (B) which bisects the horseshoe semicircle. All coordinates are in centimeters. You can be
assured that the distance between points A and B for each horseshoe will be 100.000001 centimeters.
The figure below illustrates the meanings of the values on each line.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 569  Horse Shoe Scoring 2/2

The first four lines of input define the horseshoe positions for the first turn; lines 5 through 8 define
the second turn, etc. There are at most 9999 turns in the input file, and every turn contains four
horseshoe positions. Your program should continue reading input to the end of file.

## Sample Input

```text
The first line of output for your program should be the string Turn Score in columns 1 through 10.
For each turn, your program should print the number of the turn right-justified in columns 1-4 (turns
are numbered starting with 1), a single space (ASCII character 32 decimal) in columns 5 through 8,
and the score for the turn right-justified in columns 9 and 10 with a single leading blank for scores 0 to
9. Numbers that are right-justified should be preceded by blanks, not zeroes, as the fill character.

```
