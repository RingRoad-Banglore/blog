## Input

```
You are given a quadratic function,

f(x) = ax2 + bx+ c

You are also given a divisor d and a limit L. How
many of the function values f(0), f(1), . . . , f(L) are
divisible by d?
```

## Output

```
Input consists of a number of test cases. Each test
case consists of a single line containing the numbers
a b c d L (1000  a, b, c  1000, 1 < d < 1000000,
0  L < 1000).

Input is terminated by a line containing 0 0 0 0 0 which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
Print the answer for each test case (the number of function values f(0), f(1), . . . , f(L) divisible by d)
on a separate line.

```

## Sample Output

```
0 0 10 5 100
0 0 10 6 100
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 3 5
0 0 0 0 0
