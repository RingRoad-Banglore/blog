title: Uva 10594  Data Flow

## Input

```text
In the latest Lab of IIUC, it requires to send huge amount of data from the local server to the terminal
server. The lab setup is not yet ready. It requires to write a router program for the best path of data.
The problem is all links of the network has a fixed capacity and cannot flow more than that amount of
data. Also it takes certain amount of time to send one unit data through the link. To avoid the collision
at a time only one data unit can travel i.e. at any instant more than one unit of data cannot travel
parallel through the network. This may be time consuming but it certainly gives no collision. Each
node has sufficient buffering capability so that data can be temporarily stored there. IIUC management
wants the shortest possible time to send all the data from the local server to the final one.

For example, in the above network if anyone wants to send 20 unit data from A to D, he will send
10 unit data through AD link and then 10 unit data through AB-BD link which will take 10+70=80
unit time.
```

## Output

```text
Each input starts with two positive integers N (2  N  100), M (1  M  5000). In next few lines
the link and corresponding propagation time will be given. The links are bidirectional and there will
be at most one link between two network nodes. In next line there will be two positive integers D, K
where D is the amount of data to be transferred from 1-st to N -th node and K is the link capacity.
Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each dataset, print the minimum possible time in a line to send all the data. If it is not possible to
send all the data, print Impossible.. The time can be as large as 1015.
