title: Uva 01144  Find the Walls
---


## Input

```text
Usually, labyrinths are to be solved by finding a path
from entry to exit. This time, you are to discover the
labyrinth itself...

A labyrinth is laid on a square N  N grid, and
hence contains N2 cells. Every cell holds the total
number of cells that are visible both vertically and
horizontally, the walls being opaque. For instance, in
the picture above, the center cell (second row, second
column) holds 1, since there are walls surround-
ing the cell in all directions except above, where the
next wall is one cell away. Similarly, the leftmost-
bottommost cell (third row, first column) holds 4
since, from this cell, one sees 2 cells above, 2 other
cells to the right, none below and none to the left.

Given the numbers in the cells, find the labyrinth.
You may assume that the square grid is surrounded
by walls and that the problem has a solution.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of then defined as follows:

The first line consists of number N , with 1  N  16. Then come N lines, each containing the N
integers of a row.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input case, output an ASCII representation of the labyrinth. This representations is made of
2N + 1 lines of 2N + 1 characters. For instance the labyrinth above should be given as:

+-+-+-+
| | |
+ + + +
| | | |
+ +-+ +
| |
+-+-+-+

Notice that walls are represented either by - or | depending on whether they are horizontal or
vertical. Cells and lack of walls are rendered by ordinary spaces, while (potential) walls meet on +.

Write a blank line to separate the output of two consecutive cases.

```
