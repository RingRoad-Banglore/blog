title: Uva 00631  Microzoft Calendar

```
It is now year 2003. Five years ago some computer companies and some media were threatening people
about problems which may occur at century break due to inability of older programs to resolve properly
the passing to year 2000. Media restricted themselves to threatening. Software companies offered several
solutions, though they were all different from each other. To make the situation even worse, all the
solutions had the same, basic drawback - they were simply patches on old system.

Thank God there was a company, which did not accept partial solutions, and all the time was
doing its best to make the users life easier. It was called Microzoft - name not widely recognised in
these ancient times. Its imaginative boss felt that it was definitely time for a change. With the next
version of revolutionising operating system Doors MKB (Microzoft Knows Better) a new calendar was
introduced. It was thought to solve all the nasty problems.

The year is divided into two periods: Gill and Bates. Each period is divided into five months called:
Sun, Water, Forest, Mountains and curiously enough - Money. Each month has 36 days and consists
of 6 weeks. Consecutive 6-days long weeks are called: First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth.
Remaining 5(6) days do not belong to any of those periods, months nor weeks and are just to celebrate
anniversaries of release of historic product Doors MKB. Thus they are called: Feast 1, Feast 2 ... Feast
5/6. Dates in Microzofts calendar are written in the following way:

< Period >-< Month >-< Week >-< Number of day in the week >-< Y ear >, for days 1..360
< Name of celebration day >-< Y ear >, for days 361..365/366

The first day of the first year was 25th June 1998 (day of release of Doors MKB), how it used to be
called in old calendar. In the new one leap years happen when their numbers are dividable without any
rest by 4 and are not dividable without rest by 100 or are dividable by 400 (That is the way it worked
in the old calendar too). For example 4, 8, 400 are leaping years, but 5, 98, 100 are not. Dates before
release have also a symbol bd (with stands for before Doors) assigned.

Obviously not all the people appreciated the new idea and it was not accepted as a standard
immediately. However five years of trials (and especially losses caused by the year 2000) convinced
mankind of the greatness of the new calendar. More and more countries and companies switch to
the new system. To ease those in trouble Microzoft introduces a new pocket device called Microzoft
Calendar Converter. It is your task to program it.

The schedule of weeks and months in the year is presented below:

Days in year Week Month Period
1..6 First Sun Gill
7..12 Second Sun Gill
13..18 Third Sun Gill
19..24 Fourth Sun Gill
25..30 Fifth Sun Gill
31..36 Sixth Sun Gill
37..42 First Water Gill
43..48 Water Gill
........... ...... ....... ......
355..360 Sixth Money Bates

361..365/6 ........... ............. ......
