## Input

```text
The Sell N Profit shop has recently had a raffle contest with a prize of a dress and matching shoes to
some of their regular customers. They have set aside an equal number of dresses and pairs of shoes of
different designs for the purpose.

The plan was going quite well until one customer pointed out that not all the dresses and all the
pairs of shoes match each other (i.e. you wont look good if you wore that dress and that pair of shoes
at the same time - but the same dress or shoes might look good with something else). So, simply giving
someone a dress and a pair of shoes at random, risks angering their customers. They have to give each
winner a dress and shoes that match. But some pairs of (dress, shoes) are so adorable to girls such that
if they are given to any girl, she would be happier than ever and she may become a great customer of
the shop. These pairs are called super matching pairs. But, choosing such pair may lead to a situation
that some other girls get non-matching (dress, shoes) pairs.

Now you are given n dresses and n pairs of shoes, a list of what dress matches which shoes and
some super matching (dress, shoes) pairs. As the company have lack of fashion sense, they ask you to
find how many ways there are to make up n sets of dresses and matching shoes, such that either all the
girls are happy (got matching dress and shoes), or at least one of the girls got a super matching pair.

and pair of shoes. Each of the next n lines contains n space separated integers (one of 0, 1 or 2). The
j-th integer in i-th line represents the status of the i-th dress and j-th pair of shoes. 0 means that i-th
dress doesnt match j-th pair of shoes. 1 means they match. 2 means they are super matching.
