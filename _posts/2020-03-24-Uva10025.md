title: Uva 10025  The ? 1 ? 2 ? ... ? n = k problem
---


## Input

```text
Given the following formula, one can set operators + or - instead of each ?, in order to obtain a
given k

?1?2? . . .?n = k

For example: to obtain k = 12, the expression to be used will be:

- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 - 7 = 12

with n = 7
```

## Output

```text
The first line is the number of test cases, followed by a blank line.

Each test case of the input contains an integer k (0  |k|  1000000000).
Each test case will be separated by a single line.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, your program should print the minimal possible n (1  n) to obtain k with the
above formula.

Print a blank line between the outputs for two consecutive test cases.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2

12

-3646397

```
