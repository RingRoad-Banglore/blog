title: Uva 10049  Selfdescribing Sequence
---


## Input

```
Solomon Golombs selfdescribing sequence f(1), f(2), f(3), . . . is the only non decreasing sequence of
positive integers with the property that it contains exactly f(k) occurrences of k for each k. A few
moments thought reveals that the sequence must begin as follows:

n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

f(n) 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 6

In this problem you are expected to write a program that calculates the value of f(n) given the
value of n.
```

## Output

```
The input may contain multiple test cases. Each test case occupies a separate line and contains an
integer n (1  n  2, 000, 000, 000). The input terminates with a test case containing a value 0 for n
and this case must not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input output the value of f(n) on a separate line.

```

## Sample Output

```
100
9999
123456
1000000000
0

```
