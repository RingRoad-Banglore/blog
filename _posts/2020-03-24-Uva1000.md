title: Uva 01000  Airport Configuration
---


```

ACMAirlines is a regional airline with von Neumann Airport as its home port. For many passengers, von
Neumann Airport is not the start of their trip, nor their final destination, so many transfer passengers
pass through the airport.

The von Neumann Airport has a corridor layout. Arrival gates are located, equally spaced, at the
north side of the corridor. Departure gates are at the south side of the corridor, equally spaced as well.
The distance between two adjacent gates equals the width of the corridor. Each arrival gate is assigned
to exactly one city, and the same holds for the departure gates. Passengers arrive at the arrival gate
assigned to their city of origin and exit the terminal or proceed to a connecting flight at a gate assigned
to their destination city. For this problem, only passengers with connecting flights are considered.

Transferring passengers generate a lot of traffic in the corridor. The average number of people
traveling between cities is known beforehand. Using this information, it should be possible to reduce
the traffic. If transfers from city Cx to city Cy occur very frequently, it may help to locate the gates
assigned to these cities near or even directly opposite each other.

Due to the presence of shops and gardens it is not possible to cross the corridor diagonally, so the
distance between arriving gate G1 and departing gate G3 (see diagram) equals 1 + 2 = 3.

You must assess total traffic load for several different configurations. The traffic load between an
origin and destination gate is defined as the number of origin to destination passengers multiplied by
the distance between the arriving and departing gate. The total traffic load is the sum of the traffic
loads for all origin-destination pairs.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases. The last test case in the input file is followed by a line
containing the number 0.

Each test case has two parts: first the traffic data, then the configuration section.

The traffic data starts with an integer N (1  N  25), representing the number of cities. The
following N lines each represent traffic data for one city. Each line with traffic data begins with an
integer in the range 1...N identifying the city of origin. This is then followed by an integer k. Finally,
there follow k pairs of integers, one pair for every destination city. Each pair identifies the destination
city and the number of passengers (at most 500) traveling from the city of origin to this destination
city.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1000  Airport Configuration 2/2

The configuration section consists of one or more (at most 20) configurations and ends with a line
containing the number 0.

A configuration consists of 3 lines. The first line contains a positive number identifying the config-
uration. The next line contains a permutation of the cities, as they are assigned to the arrival gates:
the first number represents the city assigned to the first gate, and so on. The next line in the same way
represents the cities as they are assigned to the departure gates.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output contains a table presenting the configuration numbers and total traffic
load, in ascending order of traffic load. If two configurations have the same traffic load, the one with
the lowest configuration number should go first.

Follow the output format shown in the sample below. Note that the configuration number is right-
aligned to a width of five characters and the traffic load is left justified.
