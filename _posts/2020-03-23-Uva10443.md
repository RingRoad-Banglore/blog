10443 Rock, Scissors, Paper
Bart’s sister Lisa has created a new civilization on a two-
dimensional grid. At the outset each grid location may be oc-
cupied by one of three life forms: Rocks, Scissors, or Papers.
Each day, differing life forms occupying horizontally or vertically
adjacent grid locations wage war. In each war, Rocks always de-
feat Scissors, Scissors always defeat Papers, and Papers always
defeat Rocks. At the end of the day, the victor expands its ter-
ritory to include the loser’s grid position. The loser vacates the
position.

Your job is to determine the territory occupied by each life
form after n days.

## Input
The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases. Each
test case begins with three integers not greater than 100: r and
c, the number of rows and columns in the grid, and n. The grid
is represented by the r lines that follow, each with c characters.
Each character in the grid is ‘R’, ‘S’, or ‘P’, indicating that it is occupied by Rocks, Scissors, or Papers
respectively.

## Output
For each test case, print the grid as it appears at the end of the n-th day. Leave an empty line between
the output for successive test cases.

## Sample Input

## Sample Output
