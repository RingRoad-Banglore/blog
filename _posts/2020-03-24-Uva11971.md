---


## Input

```
John has been given a segment of lenght N , however he needs a polygon. In order to create a polygon
he has cut given segment K times at random positions (uniformly distributed cuts). Now he has K+1
much shorter segments. What is the probability that he can assemble a polygon using all new segments?
```

## Output

```
The number of tests T (T  1000) is given on the first line. T lines follow, each of them contains two
integers N K (1  N  106; 1  K  50) described above.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output a single line Case #T: F . Where T is the test case number (starting from
1) and F is the result as simple fraction in form of N/D. Please refer to the sample output for clarity.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
1 1
2 2
