## Input

```text
You probably know the famous TV game show: Cifras y Letras in Spain, CountDown in UK,
Cijfers en Letters in Nederland, Tik Tak in Israel, A word or 2 in South Africa, etc., etc., and,
of course, the original Des Chiffres et des Lettres broadcasted in France since 1972!

The game of the numbers  that is, obtain a target number by combining a tuple of input
numbers with the four basic arithmetic operations  is an all-time classic in TV contests worldwide,
and also in the science of computer algorithms. Nowadays, any computer science student should be
able to write a program that solves the problem in half a second on any off-the-shelf computer. So,
lets make it a bit more difficult...

In the original game of the numbers, called Le compte est bon, the player is given a tuple of 6
input numbers, and a target number. The purpose is to combine input numbers (all or some of them,
but not repeating any input number) with the basic arithmetic operations +, -, * and / (always
working with integer and positive numbers), in order to obtain the target number. The input numbers
can be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100.

If the target number can be obtained with the input tuple, then we will say that the tuple generates
the target. For example, the tuple (6, 4, 25, 6, 1, 100) generates the target 574 (among many other
targets) with: 6  100  25  1 = 574; but that tuple does not generate the target 765 (i.e., it is not
possible to obtain that number with the input tuple).

In this problem, we will invert the original game: we only know the target number. You have
to compute how many different input tuples generate that target. For example, the target 1 can be
generated with all input tuples, so the solution would be 146 = 7529536. Observe that we suppose that,
for example, tuples: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) are different.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer N , indicating the number of test cases. For each test
case, there is a line with an integer, between 1 and 8000, indicating the target number.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output should consist of an integer, representing the total number of different
tuples that generate the corresponding target.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
1
8000

```
