## Input

```text

Figure 1: A valid 8 ball rack

8-ball is a pool game typically played with 15 object
balls. The object balls are of following types:

1. Solids, numbered from 1-7

2. Stripes, numbered from 9-15

3. Eight ball: as the name suggests, numbered 8
and is a black solid ball.

In a valid 8-ball rack, the object balls are arranged
in a triangle as the figure above, following these rules:

1. The eight ball has to be in the center.

2. The two rear corner balls have to be of different
types. If one of them is stripes, then the other
one must be from solids. In the picture above,
two rear corner balls are 11 and 5. 11 is a stripe
and 5 is a solid.

You are given an 8 ball rack (possibly incomplete).
If a ball is not present in the rack, then you can assume that they are outside of the rack. You have
choice of three different operations:

1. Swap any two balls already in the rack.

2. Pick a ball thats not already in the rack from outside and put that into the rack.

3. Pick a ball thats already in the rack and put it outside.

Given the initial rack and the cost of the different types of operations, find the minimum cost to
form a valid 8-ball rack.

## Output

```text
The input file starts with a positive integer T (T  500) denoting the number of test cases. Each of
the T test cases starts with three non negative integers, S, P , and R, where,

1. S denotes the cost of swapping positions of any two balls.

2. P denotes the cost of adding a ball to the rack from outside.

3. R denotes the cost of removing a ball from the rack. Note that you can (well, you will have to)
return this ball to any place in the rack later.

4. 0  S, P,R  100000

Then come exactly five lines denoting the racks formation. The i-th line has i non negative numbers
in it. If the j-th number on the i-th line is 0, then it means that position is empty. It is guaranteed
that no non-zero number appears more than once in the rack.

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print a single line, Case x: y, where x is the case number and y an integer number
which denotes the minimum cost to form a valid rack for that case.

Note:
Case 1 is the rack given in the figure 1, which is already valid. So the output is 0
Case 2 is the rack given in the figure 1 only with the difference that, all the balls in the last row is

missing. A valid rack can be formed with exactly 5 type 2 operations. As P = 2, the output for case 2
is 2  5 = 10.
