title: Uva 11941  Creating a Quadtree
---


```
A quadtree, first introduced by Finkel and Bentley, is a tree data-structure in which each internal
node has exactly four children. Quadtrees are often used for problems that can be mapped into a
two-dimensional space which is then recursively subdivided it into four equally-sized regions while a
certain condition holds. Such problems include the following: collision detections, spatial data indexing,
image compression and Conways Game of Life. The problem consists in compressing a binary image
represented by an nn matrix, where n > 1 is a power of 2. The binary image is specified by means of
rectangular areas containing only white pixels. Each area is given by the location of its upper-left and
lower-right corners. The compressed image is given by a quadtree, where each node denotes a region
in the image. A region is subdivided if it is not a pixel yet and it has both white and black pixels. The
order in visiting regions is left-right, top-down.

For a better understanding of this problem, consider the third test case from Sample Input where
the binary image is a 8  8 matrix composed by five white areas. In the following figure, such areas
are highlighted with blue rectangles. Its corresponding quadtree is made up of five internal nodes and
sixteen leaves (regions).

## Input

```
The first line contains an integer N > 0 denoting the number of test cases. The next N lines contain
a space-separated list starting with an integer n > 1, power of two, which denotes the matrix size, and
followed by m  2 pairs of integers (ik, jk), such that:

a) ik is the column index

b) jk is the row index

c) 1  ik, jk  n

d) Two consecutive pairs (ik1, jk1), (ik, jk), where k is even, denotes respectively the position of
the upper-left corner and lower-right corner of the 1/2k-th area

e) If m is odd, the pair (im, jm) is ignored

## Output

```
The output consists of N lines containing either the quadtree produced at each test case, or the text
Size is invalid if the matrix size is not a power of 2. The quadtree is specified by means of a
sequence of 0s and 1s. For each black node add a 0 to the output; for each white node add a 1; for
each gray node add a * and repeat this process for each child node. Do not consider the root in the
output. Traverse the quadtree in pre-order.

## Sample Input
