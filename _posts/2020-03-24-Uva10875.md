The people at Awesome Color Monitors (ACM), Inc., makers of the Ginormatron  those big scoreboard
monitors used at most sports stadiums, are looking for new uses for their products. One of the areas
they are most interested in supporting is education in children. To this end, they would like to use
their scoreboards to teach simple mathematics to large groups of youngsters.

Once the stadium is filled with children, the scoreboard will display a simple mathematical equation,
and then, after a brief pause, print the answer underneath. Your job is to read in such equations, perform
the calculations, and print the result in scoreboard format.

The standard precedence and associatively of mathematical operators apply, so  and / have
precedence over + and -, and equations are performed left to right. Each number or operator is
displayed in a 3  5 array of pixels. Each number or operator is separated by one space. You can
assume that:

 all equations are well formed

 there are no divide-by-zero errors

 all numbers are positive integers

 operators appear as binary operators only

 division means integer division

 the intermediate and final results will fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

The numbers and operators appear in the input as follows (without the labels underneath):

000 .0. 000 000 0.0 000 0.. 000 000 000 .0. ... 0.0 .0.
0.0 .0. ..0 ..0 0.0 0.. 0.. ..0 0.0 0.0 .0. ... 0.0 ...
0.0 .0. 000 000 000 000 000 ..0 000 000 000 000 .0. 000
0.0 .0. 0.. ..0 ..0 ..0 0.0 ..0 0.0 ..0 .0. ... 0.0 ...
000 .0. 000 000 ..0 000 000 ..0 000 ..0 .0. ... 0.0 .0.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + ~ * /

As an example, the equation 128 + 256 in scoreboard notation would be:

.0. 000 000 .0. 000 000 0..

.0. ..0 0.0 .0. ..0 0.. 0..

.0. 000 000 000 000 000 000

.0. 0.. 0.0 .0. 0.. ..0 0.0

.0. 000 000 .0. 000 000 000

The resulting answer, 384, in scoreboard form would be:

000 000 0.0
..0 0.0 0.0
000 000 000
..0 0.0 ..0
000 000 ..0

## Input

```
The input consists of a sequence of equations in scoreboard notation. Each equation is contained on
one scoreboard-notation line, followed by a blank line. The maximum number of scoreboard notation
characters in one equation is 20. The end of input is denoted by a zero in scoreboard notation on a line
by itself.

```

## Output

```
For each equation, compute the resulting answer, and print your output in scoreboard notation, followed
by a blank line.
