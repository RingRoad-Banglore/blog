title: Uva 12286  Optimal Store
---


```
You live in a flat world and you have to carry
some goods to three destinations A, B, C from
a storeroom. You know the location of A, B
and C and you have to find an optimal location
G for the storeroom and build the storeroom at
G.

But for carrying goods you have only one
truck available and that can drive through any
place/location you want. The truck will ini-
tially be located at G. But this truck is not
large enough to carry goods for more than one
place at a time. So for minimum path covering
what you do is:

1. Always drive from one place to another in straight line.

2. Load goods in the truck at G.

3. Carry these goods to the nearest destination to G.

4. Unload the goods at the nearest destination.

5. Drive the empty truck back to G.

6. Load good in the truck at G.

7. Carry these goods to the 2nd nearest destination from G.

8. Unload the goods at the 2nd nearest destination.

9. Drive the empty truck back to G.

10. Load goods in the truck at G.

11. Carry these goods to the farthest destination from G. And of course stay at the farthest destina-
tion, as you have to carry nothing else.

If you had known the location of G then to find the minimum driving length would have been very
easy. But for this problem your job is to find a location of G for which the total path length would be
minimum and report this minimum driving length.

## Input

```
The input file contains less than 11000 lines of input.

Each line contains six integer numbers Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy. You can assume that (0 
Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy  1000). These integers denote that the location of A, B and C in two-
dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is (Ax, Ay), (Bx, By) and (Cx, Cy) respectively.

A line containing six negative numbers terminates the input.

## Output

```
For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of
output followed by a floating-point number d, which denotes the minimum driving length needed from
the optimal location of G. This number should have eight digits after the decimal point. Errors less
than 107 will be ignored. Look at the output for sample input for details.
