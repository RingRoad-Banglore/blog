title: Uva 10829  LGap Substrings
---


```
If a string is in the form UVU, where U is not empty, and V has exactly L characters, we say UVU is
an L-Gap string. For example, abcbabc is a 1-Gap string. xyxyxyxyxy is both a 2-Gap string and
also a 6-Gap string, but not a 10-Gap string (because U is non-empty).

Given a string s, and a positive integer g, you are to find the number of g-Gap substrings in s. s
contains lower-case letters only, and has at most 50,000 characters.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains a single integer t (1  t  10), the number of test cases. Each of the t followings
contains an integer g (1  g  10) followed by a string s.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the number of g-Gap substrings. Look at the output for
sample input for details.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
1 bbaabaaaaa
5 abxxxxxab

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 7
Case 2: 1
```
