```
After solving the easy problem of municipal elections... we want more! More parties! More voters!
More councilors!

Would you be able to deal with hundreds of parties, billions of councilors, trillions of voters?

Given the number of councilors that have to be elected, the number of votes for each party, and
the number of blank and invalid votes, you have to compute the number of councilors assigned to each
party.

As in the previous problem, you have to observe the rule of proportionality: the number of assigned
councilors has to be proportional (the maximum possible) to the number of obtained votes. In other
words, there exists a number of votes, X, such that when a party has X votes, then they win a councilor.
If two or more parties have exactly the same proportion to obtain a councilor, then you have to assign
it to the first party in alphabetical order.
```

## Input

```
The input can contain different test cases. The first line of the input indicates the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains 2 natural numbers: N , P . Number N indicates the number
of councilors to be elected, while P indicates the number of existing political parties.

The following two lines contain the text:

BLANK B
INVALID I

Where B and I indicate the number of blank and invalid votes, respectively. Next, there are P
lines, one for each party. Each line contains two values: a string without blank spaces, indicating the
name of the party; and a number, indicating the number of votes for that party.

You can assume that N and the number of votes are always between 0 and 1016, inclusive.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, you have to output the councilors obtained for each party, in the same order as they
appear in the input. Thus, you have to output P lines, with the name of the party and the number of
councilors assigned to that party, separated by a blank space.
