## Input

```
You have recently been ap-
pointed as the administrator
for a wired network of de-
vices. Unfortunately, your
predecessor used very poor
quality lines to connect the
devices. The board of exec-
utives is currently deciding if
they want to fund an upgrade
to a wireless network, or sim-
ply replace the existing wires
with ones of better quality.
As expected, this decision is
being weighed down with bu-
reaucratic nonsense; it looks
like it will take some time be-
fore anything is approved.

Meanwhile, you still have
to deal with the problem at
hand. You have access to an
antiquated version of Newton
Network Monitor which is a software package that, once installed on a machine, will monitor all lines
connected to that machine and immediately alert the user when a line has failed. This should help
reduce your response time to any failures.

Your task is to install the software on some machines so each line is being monitored by at least one
of its endpoint devices. For various technical reasons, the time it takes to install the software varies
from device to device so you want to minimize the total amount of time spent installing the software.
You cannot install on more than one machine at a time (since you only have one copy of the software)
meaning the total time spent installing the software is exactly the sum of the installation times on each
machine.
```

## Output

```
Each input case begins with two numbers n, m with 1  n  1, 000 and 0  m  25, 000. Following
this are m pairs of distinct integers between 0 and n  1 which describe a wire connecting the two
devices. The time spent installing the software on machine numbered i is 2i. The input is terminated
with n = m = 0; this should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input case, there is to be one line of output containing a sequence of n bits with no spaces.
The i-th bit is 1 if the software is installed on machine i, and 0 if not.
