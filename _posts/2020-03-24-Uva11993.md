title: Uva 11993  Girls Celebration
---


## Input

```text
In order to celebrate the 100-th anniversary of Tsinghua University, n girls are planning to hold a party.
Theyre experts at singing and dancing, and they love to perform in groups. In their current design,
there will be a stage and a row of seats. When a group of girls need to sing or dance on the stage, they
stand up from their seats, and go to the stage. When theyve finished performing, they return to their
own seat (they dont exchange seats, because every girl has a lot of personal belongings on her seat).

They want this procedure look cool, so for each performance, the actresses seats should be consec-
utive. For example, if there are 4 girls, and a performance is done by girl 1, 2 and 4, then they cannot
seat in order of 1-2-3-4, since when girl 1, 2 and 4 stand up, its strange to see a non-actress (girl 3)
sitting between girl 2 and 4.

As I mentioned, theyre too good at singing and dancing, so they managed to come up with a lot
of combinations. Now they become a bit worried: is there a way to seat all the girls, such that the
requirement above can be satisfied (i.e. for every combination, the actresses seats are consecutive).

As a decent programmer, you decide (I know that actually youre being decided, but...) to write a
program that can calculate the number of seat arrangements. Since the girls are constantly thinking
about new combinations, your program should be able to read new combinations and adjust the answer
accordingly. When there are only few possible arrangement (i.e. at most k feasible solutions), your
program should output all of them.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases. The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1  n,m, k  200), where n
is the number of girls, m is the number of combinations, and k is the parameter described above. Each
of the next m lines contains a set of integers, terminated by a zero. These integers are the IDs of the
girls in the combination (girls are numbered 1 to n). The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each new combination, output the number of seat arrangements, after considering this combination.
If there is no way, print 0 and ignore the combination. If there are at most k ways, print them one
in a line, in lexicographical order.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4 4 10
1 2 3 0
2 3 4 0
1 4 0
2 4 0

```
