## Input

```text

Bob enjoys playing computer games, especially strategic games, but some-
times he cannot find the solution fast enough and then he is very sad. Now
he has the following problem. He must defend a medieval city, the roads of
which form a tree. He has to put the minimum number of soldiers on the
nodes so that they can observe all the edges. Can you help him?

Your program should find the minimum number of soldiers that Bob has
to put for a given tree.

For example for the tree on the right the solution is one soldier (at the
node 1).
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several data sets in text format. Each data set represents a tree with the
following description:

 the number of nodes

 the description of each node in the following format

node identifier:(number of roads) node identifier1 . . . node identifiernumber of roads

or

node identifier:(0)

The node identifiers are integer numbers between 0 and n  1, for n nodes (0 < n  1500). Every
edge appears only once in the input data.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output should be printed on the standard output. For each given input data set, print one integer
number in a single line that gives the result (the minimum number of soldiers).
