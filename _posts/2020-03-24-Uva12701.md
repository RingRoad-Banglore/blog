```

The Scourge are marching South-West with the biggest army ever seen, and theyre marching fast. All
the Sentinel towers are in ruins. Theres chaos all over their base. Whatever they have to do, they have
to do it by tonight or they will be terminated from the face of the earth tomorrow.

A secret meeting is being conducted by Zeus, the lord of Olympus and the father of gods. The end
is near. dreads Sven. Careful child. Sentinel will not be doomed before my eyes. says Zeus. Send
Riki to explore the enemy camps. Then we can come up with a plan.

Riki comes with the information that there are N enemy camps and N1 bi-directional roads, each
road connecting two camps. The lengths of the roads are different. Riki also found that there exists a
path between any pair of camps.

Thats enough information! says Zeus with excitement, We have to burn down all the roads, so
the enemies will be isolated from each other. Then we will strike. Summon Jakiro, hell know what to
do.

Jakiro, the Twin Head Dragon is summoned. He will use his ultimate spell, Macropyre to burn all
the roads down. To do this he will follow these steps:

1. Select 2 different camps such that the shortest path between them doesnt include any burned
road.

2. Prepare the spell with required mana. The mana cost for this spell is equal to the average of the
lengths of roads in the path.

3. Burn all roads in the selected path.

He will keep burning this way until all the roads are burning. It is important that he uses minimum
total mana for this task, as he needs mana for the battle afterwards. Now write a program to calculate
the least mana required by Jakiro to burn all the roads down. Remember, you dont need to minimize
the number times the spell is used.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain multiple test cases and number of test cases  50. Each case starts with an
integer N (2  N  14) denoting the number of enemy camps. The camps are numbered from 0 to
N1. Each of the next N1 lines contain three integers A B C (0  A,B < N , A = B, 1  C  10000)
denoting that camp A and B are connected by a road whose length is C units. You may assume that
all pairs of A&B are unique.

The input terminates with a value 0 for N .

```

## Output

```
For each case, print on a line the least total mana required by Jakiro rounded upto exactly 4 decimal
points.

Output Explanation

In sample test 1, if we first select camps 1 & 3 and use spell on the path 1  2  3, the required
mana would be (2+3)/2 = 2.5 . Then we select camps 0 & 2 and use spell on the path 0  2 which
would require 1/1 = 1 mana. So the total mana required to burn all the roads is 2.5 + 1 = 3.5, which
is the minimum value possible.

In sample test 2, we can use spell on paths 1  0  2, 0  3 and 4  0  5. It would cost mana
(10000+10000)/2 = 10000, 1/1 = 1 and (10000+1)/2 = 5000.5 respectively. In total it would cost
10000 + 1 + 5000.5 = 15001.5 mana, which is the optimal value.
