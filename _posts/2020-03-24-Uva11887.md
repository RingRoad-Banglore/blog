title: Uva 11887  Tetrahedrons and Spheres
---


## Input

```text
There are a tetrahedrons and b spheres in the 3D-splace, youre asked to calculate the volume occupied
by at least one of them (i.e. volume of the union of the objects).
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each case begins with two integers a, b, the number of tetrahedrons
and the number of spheres (1  a, b  5). The next a lines each contains 12 integers: x1, y1, z1, x2,
y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, x4, y4, z4, the coordinates (xi, yi, zi)(1  i  4) of the four vertices of a tetrahedron.
The next b lines each contains 4 integers x, y, z, r, the coordinates of the center (x, y, z) and the radius
r (r  3). All the coordinate values are integers with absolute values no more than 5. The input is
terminated by a = b = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a single line, the volume occupied by at least one of them, rounded to three
decimal points.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1 1
0 0 4 1 0 4 0 1 4 0 0 5
0 0 0 1
0 0

```
