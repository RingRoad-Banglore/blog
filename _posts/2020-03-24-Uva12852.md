## Input

```

Tell how much the miser has

There once was an old miser who had hoarded up a quantity of fve, ten
and twenty-dollar gold pieces. Before starving to death, the miser used
to count his gold using a peculiar method. He used to take his coins
and form 4 piles with them, such that each pile had the same amount
of 5, 10 and 20-dollar pieces. Not only that, but he could also divide
his gold into 5 groups, also alike (with the same number of coins of each
type). Finally he repeated the process, this time splitting the gold into
6 alike groups.

Assuming that each of the piles he made had a positive number of
gold pieces of each type, what is the minimum amount of gold that the
miser could have had?

Lets say that the miser was able to divide his gold in N diferent
ways, and for each method of partitioning he was able to form Mi
similar groups (for 1  i  N). You are asked now to determine the
minimum amount of gold he had.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases.

Each case starts with an integer N in a single line. The next line contains N integers, representing
the set M1, M2, , MN .

T  2000; 1  N  8; 2  M1 < M2 < M3 < . . . < MN  100

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the the minimum amount of gold that the miser
could have.
