title: Uva 01654  Pairs of integers
---


## Input

```

You are to find all pairs of integers such that their sum is equal to the given integer number N and the
second number results from the first one by striking out one of its digits. The first integer always has
at least two digits and starts with a non-zero digit. The second integer always has one digit less than
the first integer and may start with a zero digit.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The input file consists of a single integer N (10  N  109).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

On the first line of the output file write the total number of different pairs of integers that satisfy the
problem statement. On the following lines write all those pairs. Write one pair on a line in ascending
order of the first integer in the pair. Each pair must be written in the following format:

X + Y = N

Here X, Y , and N , must be replaced with the corresponding integer numbers. There should be
exactly one space on both sides of + and = characters.
