John Anthony Good usually meets his friends on Fridays to have a poker night. They play Texas
Holdem poker which is, nowadays, the most popular poker game. In Texas Holdem, each player may
use any combination of his two face-down cards and the five face-up community cards to make a poker
hand. The player can use his two cards, just one, or none of them to make the best hand.

A poker deck is comprised of 52 cards, organized in four suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds,
and Clubs) and 13 values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, and A, ordered from
lowest to highest).

The hands that a player can make are the following ones (from highest to lowest):

1. Straight Flush: five cards in sequence, all of the same suit. Example: 6H 7H 8H 9H TH.
Note that the Ace can play low. Example: AS 2S 3S 4S 5S. Two hands containing a Straight
Flush are compared by their highest card. The first example beats the second one.

2. Four of a Kind: four cards of the same value. Example: AS AD AH AC 3S. Hands are
compared by the value of the four equal card values and, in case of tie, by the value of the
remaining card.

3. Full House: three cards of the same value and two cards of another. Example: 7C 7S 7D KH
KS. Hands are compared by the value of the three equal card values and, in case of tie, by the
value of the pair.

4. Flush: five cards of the same suit. Example: 5D AD KD 7D QD. Hands are compared by
their highest card; in case of tie, by the second highest one, and so on.

5. Straight: five cards in sequence. Example: TH JD QC KD AS. Note that the Ace can also
play low.

6. Three of a Kind: three cards of the same value. Example: QS QH QC 2D 3C. Hands are
compared by the value of the three equal card values and, in case of tie, by the highest value of
the remaining cards, and so on.

7. Two Pair: two cards of the same value, plus two cards of another value (that match each other
but not the first pair). Example: 2C 2H 6C 6S 4D. Hands are compared by the highest pair
and, in case of tie, by the other pair. If both are the same, hands are compared by the remaining
card.

8. One Pair: two cards of the same value. Example: 2C 2H 4H QH KD. Hands are compared
by the pair, and then by the highest remaining card, and so on.

9. High Cards: none of the previous hands. Example: 3H 7D JD QD AC. Hands are compared
by their highest card, in case of tie, by the second highest one, and so on.

John Anthony and his friends bet 5 euros each night and he always loses his money, sometimes
because he thinks that he has a lower hand than he actually has. Particularly, he has serious problems
when his hand is a straight.

In order to improve his poker skills, John Anthony has made up a solitaire card game. He shuffles
the deck and puts 49 cards from the 52-card deck faced-up on the table compounding a 7  7-card
square. For example, you can have the following case:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 11789  Texas Holdem Poker Solitaire 2/3

2C KC 3D 7S 7H 5D 6D
2H 7D 4H 4S TS 3H 8S
3S 5H AD 5S 6S 3C 9C
9S JC QC KD JH KS QS
6C 8H AC 2S 6H AH KH
TC AS 9H QD 7C 4C 8C
TH 2D JS 9D 8D 5C JD

Then, he checks the seven rows (starting from top to bottom), the seven columns (starting from left
to right), and the two diagonals (first, the one starting in the top-left corner and, then, the diagonal
starting in the bottom-left corner). For each one of these sixteen sets of seven cards he tries to select
the combination of five cards that comprise the highest possible hand (as in Texas Holdem).

Now, he is asking you to write a program that helps him to check if the hand that he finds is the
highest one.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of a first line with a number indicating the number of test cases. Then the test
cases are separated by a new line. Each test case consists of seven lines with seven cards each one
separated by blank spaces. Each card is represented by his value (first) and his suit (second) without
spaces between them.

```

## Output

```
For each input case, you must print a line with the following information. First, the line with the seven
cards that include the best hand in the same order that they appear (rows and diagonals from left
to right, and columns from top to bottom). Then two blank spaces, and the five cards that give the
highest hand in the same order that they appear in the line. Finally, two blank spaces more and the
name of the hand (High Cards, One Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush,
Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush). In case of two hands with the same score, the
hand that should be printed is the first one in the order in which the square and the cards are checked
by John Anthony.
