191 Intersection

Figure 1: Line segment does not
intersect rectangle

You are to write a program that has to decide whether a given
line segment intersects a given rectangle.

An example:

line: start point: (4,9)
end point: (11,2)

rectangle: left-top: (1,5)
right-bottom: (7,1)

The line is said to intersect the rectangle if the line and the
rectangle have at least one point in common. The rectangle con-
sists of four straight lines and the area in between. Although all
input values are integer numbers, valid intersection points do not
have to lay on the integer grid.

## Input
The input consists of n test cases. The first line of the input file contains the number n. Each following
line contains one test case of the format:

xstart ystart xend yend xleft ytop xright ybottom

where (xstart, ystart) is the start and (xend, yend) the end point of the line and (xleft, ytop) the top
left and (xright, ybottom) the bottom right corner of the rectangle. The eight numbers are separated
by a blank. The terms top left and bottom right do not imply any ordering of coordinates.

## Output
For each test case in the input file, the output file should contain a line consisting either of the letter
‘T’ if the line segment intersects the rectangle or the letter ‘F’ if the line segment does not intersect the
rectangle.

## Sample Input
<p>1</p><p>4 9 11 2 1 5 7 1</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>F</p>
