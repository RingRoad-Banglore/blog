```

The relations  and  are defined over the set of functions of a program.

 A  B means that the function A directly calls the function B;

 A  B means that the function A calls the function B (directly or indirectly).

In addition, it is known that:

 if A  B then A  B

 if A  B and B  C then A  C

A computer aided software engineering system is able to group the functions of a program into
modules according to the following rules:

1. If A  B and B  A then the functions A and B are grouped in the same module.

2. Any two functions which do not satisfy (1) must be in different modules.

Write a program that is able to modularize a program according to the rules (1) and (2) given
above.
```

## Input

```
The program reads sets of data from a text file. Each set of data stands for a different program to be
modularized and has the format:

(Fun1 Fun11 . . . Fun1n1) (Fun2 Fun21 . . . Fun2n2) . . . (Funm Funm1 . . . Funmnm).

where Funi and Funij , i = 1,m, j = 1, nj , m,nj  0, are letters (case sensitive) designating names of
functions. The meaning of the term (Funi Funi1 . . . Funini), ni  0, is: Funi  Funij , j = 1, nj .
The data set is ended by a dot. Spaces, tabs and line breaks are used freely in the input. Input data
are correct, i.e. each data set contains exactly one term (Fun Fun1 . . . Funn), for each Fun of the
program encoded by the data set, and Funi = Funj for i = j, i, j = 1, n.

```

## Output

```
The result of the program is on standard output. For each data set the program lists the function names
of each computed module, one module per line. The names of the functions of a module are listed in
ascending lexicographic order and are separated by single spaces. The modules are listed ascendingly
according to the lexicographic order of their first component (function name). The output for the data
set is followed by an empty line.

Note: The example below shows an input file, which contains three data sets, and the corresponding
output.

The first data set stands for an empty set of functions and the corresponding output is an empty
line. For the second data set there are two singleton modules a and b, whereas for the third data set
there are three modules a b e, c and d.
