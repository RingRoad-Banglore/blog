title: Uva 00555  Bridge Hands
---


## Input

```text
Many games, such as Bridge, involve dealing a standard deck of 52 cards to 4 players, so each receives
13 cards. Good players can then play with the hand as it is dealt, but most ordinary players will need
to sort it, firstly by suit, and then by rank within suit.

There is no fixed ranking of the suits for this purpose, but it is useful to alternate the colours, so
we will presume the following ordering:  <  <  < . (Note that from now on we will use the more
conventional C, D, S, H for CLUBS, DIAMONDS, SPADES and HEARTS). Within a suit Ace is
high, so the ordering is 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < T < J < Q < K < A.

The players are usually designated North, South, East and West,
and they sit at the points of the compass they name. One player is
designated the dealer and he (or she) deals one card to each player
starting with the player on his (her) left hand and proceeding clockwise
until he (she) deals the last card to himself (herself).

Write a program that will read in a presentation of a deck of cards,
deal them, sort them, and then display the 4 sorted hands in the format
shown below.

## Output
