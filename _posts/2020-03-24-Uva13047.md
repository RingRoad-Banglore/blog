title: Uva 13047  Arrows
---


```
We like to do ASCII art which involves creating various symbols or pictures using the ASCII characters.
Today we are going to draw arrows!

There are four types of arrows that can be drawn. Left single arrow, left double arrow, right single
arrow and right double arrow.

A left single arrow is defined by a left angle bracket character (<) immediately followed by zero
or more consecutive hyphen characters (-). A left double arrow is a left angle bracket character (<)
immediately followed by zero or more consecutive equals characters (=). A right single arrow is zero
or more hyphen characters (-) immediately followed by a right angle bracket character (>). A right
double arrow is zero or more equals characters (=) immediately followed by a right angle bracket
character (>).

For example, the following strings are arrows (quotes for clarity only): ==>, <-, <, <===,
--->, >. But ==----=== is not an arrow. The length of an arrow is measured by the number of
characters it contains.

You will be given a String s. Calculate the length of the longest arrow in s, or -1 if it does not
contain any arrows at all.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input is an integer T (1  T  150), the number of test cases. Each of the following
T lines contain a string S, which is no longer than 50 characters and contains only the four different
characters mentioned in the problem.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line in the following format: Case X: Y  (without quotes), where X is
the test case number starting from 1 and Y is the length of the longest arrow in the input string of
corresponding test case. Check sample input and output for details.

## Sample Input

```

<----=====>

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 1
Case 2: -1
Case 3: 6
