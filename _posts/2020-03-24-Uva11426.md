title: Uva 11426  GCD Extreme (II)
---


## Input

```text
Given the value of N , you will have to find the value of G. The definition of G is given below:

G =
i<N
i=1

jN
j=i+1

GCD(i, j)

Here GCD(i, j) means the greatest common divisor of integer i and integer j.
For those who have trouble understanding summation notation, the meaning of G is given in the

following code:

G=0;
for(i=1;i<N;i++)
for(j=i+1;j<=N;j++)
{

G+=gcd(i,j);
}
/*Here gcd() is a function that finds
the greatest common divisor of the two
input numbers*/
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 100 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer N (1 < N < 4000001).
The meaning of N is given in the problem statement. Input is terminated by a line containing a single
zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the value of G for the corresponding
N . The value of G will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10
100
200000
0

```
