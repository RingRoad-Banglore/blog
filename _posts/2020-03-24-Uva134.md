title: Uva 00134  LoglanA Logical Language
---


## Input

```
Loglan is a synthetic speakable language designed to test some of the fundamental problems of lin-
guistics, such as the Sapir Whorf hypothesis. It is syntactically unambiguous, culturally neutral and
metaphysically parsimonious. What follows is a gross over-simplification of an already very small gram-
mar of some 200 rules.

Loglan sentences consist of a series of words and names, separated by spaces, and are terminated
by a period (.). Loglan words all end with a vowel; names, which are derived extra-linguistically, end
with a consonant. Loglan words are divided into two classes  little words which specify the structure
of a sentence, and predicates which have the form CCVCV or CVCCV where C represents a consonant
and V represents a vowel (see examples later).

The subset of Loglan that we are considering uses the following grammar:
A  a | e | i | o | u
MOD  ga | ge | gi | go | gu
BA  ba | be | bi | bo | bu
DA  da | de | di | do | du
LA  la | le | li | lo | lu
NAM  {all names}
PREDA  {all predicates}
< sentence >  < statement > | < predclaim >
< predclaim >  < predname > BA < preds > | DA < preds >
< preds >  < predstring > | < preds > A < predstring >
< predname >  LA < predstring > | NAM
< predstring >  PREDA | < predstring > PREDA
< statement >  < predname > < verbpred > < predname > | < predname > < verbpred >
< verbpred >  MOD < predstring >

Write a program that will read a succession of strings and determine whether or not they are
correctly formed Loglan sentences.
```

## Output

```
Each Loglan sentence will start on a new line and will be terminated by a period (.). The sentence
may occupy more than one line and words may be separated by more than one space. The input will
be terminated by a line containing a single #. You can assume that all words will be correctly formed.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output will consist of one line for each sentence containing either Good or Bad!.
