title: Uva 13170  Verbal arithmetic
---


```
The amount of riddles, jigsaws and puzzles that have arisen during the years is huge. Among them,
mathematical puzzles constitute a category by themselves, with riddles about arithmetics, combinatorial,
topology or probability.

Today we will focus on the so-called verbal arithmetic or cryptarithmetic. On it, puzzles are math-
ematical operations where digits have been replaced by letters, and the original numbers have to be
found.

ada 323
 byron   18504
revived 5976792
```

## Input

```
Each test case is an arithmetic operation (sum or product) where digits have been replaced by lowercase
letters from the English alphabet. The two operands separated by a + or * operator are provided,
followed by an equal symbol and the result of the operation, also in letters. Numbers and operators are
separated by a space.

The operands wont have more than 8 lowercase letters; in addition to that, it is guaranteed that
there wont be more than 10 different letters in total.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the program will write the associated operation after converting letters to digits,
so that everytime the same letter appears, its converted to the same digit and viceversa, and the
arithmetical operation is correct. The solution is guaranteed to be unique.

A space has to be added before and after each operator. An assignation where any of the numbers
has redundant zeroes is not considered valid, but keep in mind that some of the values could be 0,
which is valid.

```

## Sample Input

```
ada * byron = revived
alan * turing = intellect
barack + obama = amazes
donald + trump = mutant

```

## Sample Output

```
323 * 18504 = 5976792
2023 * 461938 = 934500574
780831 + 47828 = 828659
489634 + 12057 = 501691
```
