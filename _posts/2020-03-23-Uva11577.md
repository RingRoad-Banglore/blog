11577 Letter Frequency
In this problem we are interested in
the frequency of letters in a given line
of text. Specifically, we want to know
the most frequently occurring letter(s)
in the text, ignoring case (to be clear,
“letters” refers precisely to the 26 let-
ters of the alphabet).

## Input
Input begins with the number of test cases on its own line. Each test case consists of a single line of
text. The line may contain non-letter characters, but is guaranteed to contain at least one letter and
less than 200 characters in total.

## Output
For each test case, output a line containing the most frequently occurring letter(s) from the text in
lowercase (if there are ties, output all such letters in alphabetical order).

## Sample Input
<p>1</p><p>Computers account for only 5% of the country's commercial electricity consumption.</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>co</p>
