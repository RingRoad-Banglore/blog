title: Uva 12466  Ancestors

## Input

```text
You will be given a connected undirected tree. Each node will have an associated integer that we will
call its value. We also define the value of a subset of nodes as the sum of values of the nodes in the
subset.

Consider the subsets of nodes of this tree whose size is between 1 and K, inclusive, and satisfy the
property that within each subset no node is an ancestor (Formally, we say that node u is an ancestor
of node v if u lies on the path from v to the root of the tree) of another. We will call these subsets the
K-anti-ancestral subsets of the tree.

Your task is, given the tree, to find the K-anti-ancestral subset of maximum value.
As an example, consider the tree below. Each node is named with a capital letter and the value of

each node is the integer below the letter:

Suppose K = 3. Then the subset of nodes {A}, {B, E}, {C, E}, {D, G} and {B, E, F} are some of
the K-anti-ancestral subsets of the tree, because they all have between 1 and K = 3 nodes and within
each subset there doesnt exist a pair of nodes such that one is an ancestor of the other.

On the other hand, {A, B} is not a K-anti-ancestral subset because A is an ancestor of B, {A, G}
isnt one because A is an ancestor of G and {C, B, D} isnt one either because B is an ancestor of
both C and D. The subset {C, D, E, F}, even though it doesnt contain a node that is an ancestor of
another one, is not a K-anti-ancestral subset because it has 4 > K = 3 nodes. Similarly, the empty set
 is not one either because it contains 0 elements.

The value of the K-anti-ancestral subset {A} is 6; the value of {B, E} is 3 + 1 = 4; the value of
{C, E} is 4 + 1 = 5; the value of {D, G} is -1 + 1 = 0 and the value of {B, E, F} is 3 + 1 + (-5)
= -2. Since the tree is small, its easy to convince yourself by inspection that the maximum possible
value of any K-anti-ancestral subset is 6. However, notice that there might be several ways to achieve
the maximum value: {A} and {C, E, G} both have value 6. You are only asked to find the value of
the maximum K-anti-ancestral subset so it doesnt really matter how many of them exist.

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases (at most 50).

Each test case is described on three lines:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12466  Ancestors 2/3

 The first line contains two integers N and K, the number of nodes in the tree and the parameter
K as explained above. Assume 2  N  105 and 1  K  100 (notice that these constraints
guarantee that there will always exist at least one K-anti-ancestral subset, e.g. by taking a single
node). The nodes will be numbered 0 through N  1. The root of the tree will always be node
0. You can assume that the tree will always be connected, i.e., there will always exist a path
connecting any pair of nodes.

 The second line contains N integers separated by spaces. These integers represent the values of
nodes 0 through N  1 (the first integer is the value of node 0, the second integer is the value
of node 1 and so on  the last integer is the value of node N  1). The value of any node will
always be between -100 and 100, inclusive.

 The third line contains the description of the tree. It contains N  1 integers separated by spaces
that represent the parent nodes of nodes 1 through N  1 (the first integer is the parent of node
1, the second integer is the parent of node 2 and so on  the last integer is the parent of node
N  1). Notice that since 0 is always the root of the tree it doesnt have a parent and thats why
this line contains only N  1 numbers instead of N .

The last line contains two zeros and should not be processed.
See the sample input for clarification about this format. The first test case is the tree given in the

figure above.
