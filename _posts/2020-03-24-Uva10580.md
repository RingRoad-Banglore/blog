---


## Input

```text
Gilbert Bates, the magnate of aluminum siding, doors, and windows, has been kidnapped. You are to
help the perpetrators produce a ransom note. Your raw materials are the text of a newspaper and the
text of the ransom note. The ransom note is to be produced by clipping letters or strings of letters (and
possibly spaces) from the newspaper and pasting them onto a blank sheet of paper to form the note.
Your job is to determine the minumum number of pieces of paper that must be clipped and pasted to
form the note. Between each pair of words in the note, either the clipping must contain a space or a
boundary between clippings must occur (so that the blank background shows through).

Rain Users Guide
While "rain" was intended to be a general purpose tool, at the time of
writing the primary goal was to study one particular software system.
As a result, some steps that are only done once (such as extracting
information from the program under study) are done using cumbersome
ad-hoc techniques that require significant manual intervention. While
"rain" can be used on arbitrary programs, more development work needs
to be done before this is a convenient process.
