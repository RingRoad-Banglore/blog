## Input

```
Mathematicians are a curious breed of people. Especially number theorists. They spend most of their
time thinking about different properties of numbers. Albert Meyer, a number theorist, is trying to
discover an interesting sequence of positive integers. He suspects the sequence i1, i2, i3, . . . in which the
value of in is the number of numbers m, 1  m  n, where gcd(m,n) = 1 and gcd(m,n) = m, is very
interesting. gcd is short for greatest common divisor. He has turned to you, as you are an expert
programmer and the calculations by hand are very tedious, to calculate a few numbers in this sequence.

## Output

```
The input will consist of several positive integers 0  n  231. The input will be terminated by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each number output the number of numbers m, 1  m  n, where gcd(m,n) = 1 and gcd(m,n) = m.
