title: Uva 10960  The Party Part II
---


```
In the middle of the party, Donna Anna, Donna Elvira, and Don Ottavio arrive masked, and intent to
confront Don Giovanni when they find him. You, as a guest of the party, know what they want to do.
You want to stay out of trouble, so you would like to keep away from them. But they mask themselves
along with other guests, and you have trouble identifying them. Fortunately, you have collected a set
of clues from other guests. You have to analyse them and find out who is who.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The input starts with a line with 4 positive numbers, n, i, c, and u, separated by a space. n is the
number of people in the set of clues, i is the number of items (such as shoes, masks, clothes, etc.) that
can be identified by colours, c is the number of possible colours.

The rest of input consists of u lines of clues. There are three types of clues:

1. Same colour of item X = < list of people >

2. Colour Y for item X = < list of people >

3. Not colour Y for item X = < list of people >

The first clue means that the listed people have the same colour for item X; the second clue means
that colour of item X for the listed people is Y ; the last clue means that the colour of item X for the
listed people is not Y .

X is a number from 0 to i 1 inclusive, indicating the item number. Y is a number from 0 to c 1
inclusive, indicating the colour number. < list of people > is a list of capital letters in alphabetical
order, indicating the list of people that belongs to that clue. All words/letters in a line are separated
by a space.

There are at most 26 people (from A to Z), 10 items and 10 colours (from 0 to 9).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

If the clues are inconsistent, or there is a contradiction, then output the line Contradiction,
otherwise output n lines, indicating the n people, in alphabetical order, the colour of their items in
increasing order:

P C0 C1 . . . Ci1

for the person represented by letter P , where the colour number of item 0 is C0, the colour number of
item 1 is C1 , etc., all separated by a space. If the colour of an item cannot be determined, output ?
for the colour number.
