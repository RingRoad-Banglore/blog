title: Uva 10621  Jack and Jill
---


## Input

```text
Ever since the incident on the hill, Jack
and Jill dislike each other and wish to re-
main as distant as possible. Jack and
Jill must attend school each day; Jack
attends a boys school while Jill attends
a girls school. Both schools start at
the same time. You have been retained
by their lawyers to arrange routes and a
schedule that Jack and Jill will adhere to
so as to maximize the closest straight-line
distance between them at any time dur-
ing their trip to school.

Jack and Jill live in a town laid out
as an n by n square grid (n  30). It
takes 1 minute to walk from one location
to an adjacent location. In maximizing
the distance between Jack and Jill you
need consider only the distance between
the locations they visit (i.e. you need not
consider any intermediate points on the
path they take from grid location to grid
location). Some locations are impassable
due to being occupied by rivers, build-
ings, etc. Jack must start at his house
and walk continuously until he gets to
school. Jill must start at her house at the
same time as Jack and walk continuously
until she arrives at her school. Jacks
house and school are impassable to Jill while Jills house and school are impassable to Jack. Other grid
locations that are impassable to both Jack and Jill are given in the input.
```

## Output

```text
Input will consist of several test cases. Each test case will consist of n, followed by n lines with n
characters representing a map of the town. In the map, Jacks house is represented by H, Jacks school
is represented by S, Jills house is represented by h, Jills school is represented by s, impassable
locations are represented by *, and all other locations are represented by .

You may assume the normal cartographic convention that North is at the top of the page and West
is to the left. A line containing 0 follows the last case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input case you should give three lines of output containing:

 the closest that Jack and Jill come during the schedule (to 2 decimal places)

 Jacks route



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10621  Jack and Jill 2/2

 Jills route.

Each route is a sequence of directions that Jack or Jill should follow for each minute from the start
time until arriving at school. Each direction is one of N, S, E, or W. If several pairs of routes are
possible, any one will do.

Leave a blank line between the output for successive cases.
