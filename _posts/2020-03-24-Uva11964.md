title: Uva 11964  Equation
---


## Input

```text
Your friend John was told to find an ingeter solution to the equation:

x1 + 2x2 + 4x3 + 8x4 = 15 where xi  0

John spent all week thinking and could find only one solution, it is x1 = 1; x2 = 1; x3 = 1; x4 = 1.
However, he thinks that is not the only possible integer solution to this equation, but he isnt sure
about it. You have decided to help your friend to prove or deny his assumption. In order to do this
you should write a program that finds the number of integer solutions for a given equation (let us leave
the fun of searching solutions to John). On the other hand it is rather boring to write program for this
particular equation, so you generalize it into the form:

x1 + 2x2 + 4x3 + 8x4 + 16x5 + . . .+ 2
txt = K where xi  0.

Can you manage this?
```

## Output

```text
The number of tests T (T  105) is given on the first line. Each of next T lines contains two numbers
K M (0  K  105; 1  M  1015). Where K is the number from equation and M is modulo. M can
be always factorized into primes numbers not larger than 150.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a single line Case T: N . Where T is the test case number (starting from
1) and N is the number of different integer vectors that are solutions to a given equation. As number
N can be very large, output it modulo M .

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
15 99
101 123
1234 536870912

```
