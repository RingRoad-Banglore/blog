title: Uva 11564  Just A Few More Triangles!
---


## Input

```text
Simon Haples is a somewhat peculiar person. Not quite hip,
not quite square, he is more of a triangular nature: ever
since childhood, he has had an almost unhealthy obsession
with triangles. Because of his discrete nature, Simons fa-
vorite kind of triangles are the Pythagorean ones, in which
the side lengths are three positive integers a, b, and c such
that a  b and a2 + b2 = c2.

Recently, Simon has discovered the fantastic world of
counting modulo some integer n. As you may imagine, he
quickly realizes that there are multitudes of Pythagorean
triples to which he has previously been oblivious! Simon
therefore sets out to find all Pythagorean triples modulo n,
i.e., all triples of integers a, b and c between 1 and n  1
such that a  b and a2 + b2  c2 (mod n).

As Simons best friend, you realize that there is not much hope in deterring Simon from his crazy
plans, so you decide to help him by computing how many such triples there are, so that Simon will
know when his work is done.
