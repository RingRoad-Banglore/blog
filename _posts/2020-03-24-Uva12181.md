## Input

```
You are a warden of a small towns merchant guild. Early this morning, a number of local and foreign
traders (numbered from 1 to n) line up in a row in order to enter the towns market lane. There are
n locations along the lane where the merchants can place their carts and sell their goods. Beginning
with the merchant #1, each merchant, one after the other, enters the lane with his cart, heads it to
his assigned location, and, if it is free, occupies it. Otherwise he continues to the next free spot and
occupies it. If all succeeding locations are occupied, he leaves without selling goods.

Traders are not able to turn their carts around because of the narrowness of the lane. Your job as a
warden is to assign traders to locations in the lane. The local merchants are all members of the towns
merchant guild and are privileged in that each of them gets assigned to his favourite location, whereas
the foreign traders have to accept any spot you assign to them.

Given all local traders desired locations, you have to decide whether there exists a valid assignment
of foreign traders to locations in the lane such that every trader (both foreign and local) is able to find
a free spot. If this is the case, you also have to find the number of different valid assignments modulo
a given integer M .

Example: Assume there are four traders. The first three traders in the queue are local traders with
favourite positions 2, 1 and 1 respectively. The last trader is a foreign one. Every merchant finds a free
spot in the following four cases:

(2, 1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1, 3), (2, 1, 1, 4)

where e.g. (2, 1, 1, 3) means that the first trader heads to position 2 first, . . ., and the last trader heads
to position 3. This example (which is the first test case of the sample input) shows that different local
traders might have the same favourite location, that it is valid to assign a foreign trader to a spot that
is desired by a local merchant and that a local merchants final spot might not even be close to his
favourite one.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line with three integer
numbers n, m, and M (1  n  300, 0  m  n, 2  M  109), where m is the number of local
merchants among all n traders. The next line contains exactly m pairs of integers a1, b1, . . . , am, bm
with 1  ai, bi  n and all ai different, where ai is the position of the i-th local trader in the queue and
bi gives his favourite position. If there are no local traders, this line is empty.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single line, containing NO, if it is impossible that every merchant gets a free
spot, or YES followed by the number of different assignments modulo M (separated by a single space).
