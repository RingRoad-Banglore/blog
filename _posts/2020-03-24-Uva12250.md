sian are the 6 most prominent languages in the coun-
tries of European Union. Figure on the left shows
intensity of English speaking people in different Euro-
pean countries. All of these languages have different
words to represent the English word HELLO. For
example in Spanish the word equivalent to HELLO
is HOLA. In German, French, Italian and Rus-
sian language the word that means (or similar to)
HELLO is HALLO, BONJOUR, CIAO and
ZDRAVSTVUJTE respectively. In this problem
your task is pretty simple. You will be given one of
the six words mentioned above or any other word and
you will have to try and detect the language it is from.
```

## Output

```text
Input file contains around 2000 lines of inputs. Each
line contains a string S. You can assume that all the
letters of the string are uppercase English letters and the maximum length of the string is 14. Input
is terminated by a line containing a single # character (without the quote). This line should not be
processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of
output followed by a language name. If the input string is HELLO or HOLA or HALLO or BONJOUR
or CIAO or ZDRAVSTVUJTE then you should report the language it belongs to. If the input string is
something other than these 6 strings print the string UNKNOWN (without the quotes) instead. All char-
acters in the output strings are uppercase as well. Look at the output for sample input for formatting
details.
