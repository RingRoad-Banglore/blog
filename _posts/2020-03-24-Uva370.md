## Input

```text
The game of BINGO is another of the great American pastimes. Our version of BINGO is to be played
on a square card containing a 5 5 matrix.

For this problem, you are to write a program that accepts the integers that are to be placed in the
cells of a BINGO card. Then you are to read in the called values, which may or may not be the
same as the numbers on your BINGO card, one at a time until you either find a BINGO, or you run
out of called numbers.

A BINGO occurs when one of the following rules has been fulfilled:

1. Each of the five elements in a row have either been matched by a called number, or are FREE,

2. Each of the five elements in a column have either been matched by a called number, or are FREE,

3. Each of the four corner elements have either been matched by a called number, or are FREE.

4. Each of the five elements in either prime diagonal have been matched by a called number or are
FREE.

Any element in the matrix containing a zero (0) after the original load is FREE, and is considered
to have been matched.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases.

The first five lines of every test case will each contain five integer values separated by spaces in the
range 0  V  99; these values are to be placed in the corresponding row of the matrix from left to
right. Immediately following the values for the card will be a series of lines each containing one called
number such that 1  C  99; the last line will contain an invalid called number of zero (0).

```

## Sample Input

```text
If you run out of called numbers before you find a BINGO, you are to print out the following message
immediately following the last valid called number:

No BINGO on this card.

If you find a BINGO at some point in the input, you are to ignore the rest input values, and print
out a notification of the BINGO followed by a list of comma separated triples in ROW ASCENDING
order (and in COLUMN ASCENDING order if tie) that represent the Row, Column, and Value of all
of the elements making up the BINGO. If there is more than a kind of BINGO at the same time, you
should output all of them ordered by the kind of BINGO, with no blank lines between them.

The output should have the following format:

BINGO #N
R,C,V
R,C,V
...
R,C,V

Where:
N = kind of BINGO as specified above
R = row subscript from 1 to 5, and
C = column subscript from 1 to 5, and
V = called number value that matched the cell contents, or the word FREE.

Print a blank line after each data set.

```
