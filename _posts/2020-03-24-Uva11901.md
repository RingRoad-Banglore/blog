title: Uva 11901  Ellipse Hazard
---


## Input

```text
Finding the intersection of two ar-
bitrary ellipses can be tricky. Ac-
tually even the intersection of two
axis-parallel ellipses can be tricky,
let alone ellipses that are in rotated
position like the two shown on the
right:

For two arbitrary ellipses, the
following cases can occur:

(a) They do not intersect.

(b) They intersect each other in
two points.

(c) They intersect each other in four points.

(d) They touch each other in one point.

(e) They touch each other in one point and intersect in another two points.

(f) They touch each other in two points.

In this problem you will not have to detect whether two ellipses touch each other as the given ellipses
will not touch each other: They will either intersect each other in 2 or 4 different points or will not
intersect. In other words you will have to deal with only situation (a), (b) and (c).
```

## Output

```text
There will be around 6000 cases for this problem.

Each case contains 10 integers x1, y1, a, b, 1, x2, y2, c, d, 2. Here

a) (x1, y1) = Coordinate of the center of first ellipse (0  x1, y1  1000).

b) (x2, y2) = Coordinate of the center of the second ellipse (0  x2, y2  1000).

c) a = length of semi-major axis of first ellipse (10  a  500).

d) b = length of semi-minor axis of first ellipse (10  b  500).

e) c = length of the semi-major axis of second ellipse (10  c  500).

f) d = length of the semi-minor axis of second ellipse (10  d  500).

g) 1 = angle (in degrees) the major axis of the first ellipse creates with the positive direction of
x-axis (0  1  360).

h) 2 = angle (in degrees) the major axis of second ellipse creates with the positive direction of
x-axis (0  2  360).

Input is terminated by a case where the value of a, b, c and d are negative. This case should not be
processed.

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, produce two, three or five lines of outputs. The first line contains the serial of output. If
the two ellipses do not intersect then in the next line print the line Do_not_intersect. If the ellipses
intersect in two points then print two floating-point numbers in two lines and if the ellipses intersect
in four points then print four floating-point numbers in four lines. These floating-point numbers are
actually summation of abscissa and ordinate of the intersection points. These numbers should be printed
in ascending order and should have eight digits after the decimal point. Errors less than 105 will be
ignored.
