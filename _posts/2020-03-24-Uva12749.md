title: Uva 12749  Johns Tree
---


## Input

```text

Little John is very interested about constructing a rooted tree with the following constraints:

1. A tree of depth D means that the tree should contain at least 1 node which is exactly D distance
away from the root and there is no node of more than D distance from the root.

2. The degree of a node of the tree cannot be greater than V . Degree of a node is simply measured
by the number of nodes it is directly connected to, via a single edge.

John wonders about the maximum number of nodes in a tree following the rules described above. For
example, if D = 1 and V = 2, then the maximum number of nodes in the tree is 3.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T  150). Each of the following T lines contains
two integers D (0  D  2  109) and V (1  V  2  109), respectively.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print a line of the form Case < x >: < y >, where x is the case number and y is the
maximum possible number of nodes in the tree. As the value of y can be quite large, print the value
modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). If it is not possible to construct the tree, print Case < x >: -1.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3

0 1

1 2

1 5

```
