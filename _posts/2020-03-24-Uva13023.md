## Input

```
Ins is new to programming. She is writing a simple application to handle
text. So far, the app only supports adding text to a blank document. Rita,
her restless little sister, is fascinated with all the different symbols on Ins
screen and wants to play with it, not letting Ins work any longer. In order
to be able to continue working, Ins decides to turn it into a game for Rita.

Ins will let Rita write whatever she likes in the app. Then, Ins will
select portions of the document with width W and challenge Rita to guess
how many distinct sequences of symbols there are in that portion of text.
Rita is excited to play, but there is a problem: Ins doesnt know yet how to
write a program to find the right answer for her own questions. Can you help
her out?

Given the description of the game being played by the two sisters: the text written in the document,
and Ins questions, find the number of distinct (non-empty) substrings for each of the questions. A
substring is a sequence of contiguous letters in the document.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of the input contains the text written by Rita. The text is composed only by letters
[a  z]. The second line has two space separated integers: Q and W . Q is the number of questions
and W the fixed width of Ins questions. Each of the following Q lines contains a single integer i,
describing a question to know the number of distinct substrings in the range [i, i+W  1].

Constraints:
1  |D|  100 000 Number of letters in a document.
1  Q  100 000 Number of questions.
1  W  |D| Width of Ins questions.
1  i  |D| W + 1 The question range is one-indexed and inside the document bounds.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output contains the answer to each question in the same order as in the input,
one per line.

Explanation of output 1:
The first question concerns the range [1, 3]  aca, which has 5 distinct substrings {a, c, ac, ca,

aca}.
The second question corresponds to cat, which has 6 distinct substrings: {a, c, t, ca, at, cat}.
