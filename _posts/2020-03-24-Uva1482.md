---


## Input

```

You and your friend are playing a game in which you and your friend take turns removing stones from
piles. Initially there are N piles with a1, a2, a3, . . . , aN number of stones. On each turn, a player must
remove at least one stone from one pile but no more than half of the number of stones in that pile.
The player who cannot make any moves is considered lost. For example, if there are three piles with
5, 1 and 2 stones, then the player can take 1 or 2 stones from first pile, no stone from second pile, and
only 1 stone from third pile. Note that the player cannot take any stones from the second pile as 1 is
more than half of 1 (the size of that pile). Assume that you and your friend play optimally and you
play first, determine whether you have a winning move. You are said to have a winning move if after
making that move, you can eventually win no matter what your friend does.
