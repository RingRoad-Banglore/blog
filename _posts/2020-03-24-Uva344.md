## Input

```text
Many persons are familiar with the Roman numerals for relatively small numbers. The symbols i,
v, x, l, and c represent the decimal values 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 respectively. To represent
other values, these symbols, and multiples where necessary, are concatenated, with the smaller-valued
symbols written further to the right. For example, the number 3 is represented as iii, and the value
73 is represented as lxxiii. The exceptions to this rule occur for numbers having units values of 4
or 9, and for tens values of 40 or 90. For these cases, the Roman numeral representations are iv (4),
ix (9), xl (40), and xc (90). So the Roman numeral representations for 24, 39, 44, 49, and 94
are xxiv, xxxix, xliv, xlix, and xciv, respectively.

The preface of many books has pages numbered with Roman numerals, starting with i for the
first page of the preface, and continuing in sequence. Assume books with pages having 100 or fewer
pages of preface. How many i, v, x, l, and c characters are required to number the pages in
the preface? For example, in a five page preface well use the Roman numerals i, ii, iii, iv,
and v, meaning we need 7 i characters and 2 v characters.

## Output
