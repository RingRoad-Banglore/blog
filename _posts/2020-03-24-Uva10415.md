title: Uva 10415  Eb Alto Saxophone Player
---


## Input

```
Do you like saxophone? I have a Eb Alto Saxophone, shown on the right.

My fingers move A LOT when playing some music, and Im quite
interested in how many times each finger PRESS the button. Assume
that the music is composed of only 8 kinds of note. They are: C D E
F G A B in one octave and C D E F G A B in a higher octave. We
use c,d,e,f,g,a,b,C,D,E,F,G,A,B to represent them. The fingers I use for
each note are:

 c: finger 24, 710

 d: finger 24, 79

 e: finger 24, 7, 8

 f: finger 24, 7

 g: finger 24

 a: finger 2, 3

 b: finger 2

 C: finger 3

 D: finger 14, 79

 E: finger 14, 7, 8

 F: finger 14, 7

 G: finger 14

 A: finger 13

 B: finger 12

(Note that every finger is controlling a specified button, different fingers are controlling different
buttons.)

Write a program to help count the number of times each finger presses the button. A finger presses
a button if it is needed in a note, but not used in the last note. Also, if it is the first note, every finger
required presses the button.

The first line of the input is a single integer t (1  t  1000), indicating the number of test
cases. For each case, there is only one line containing the song. The only allowed characters are
{c,d,e,f,g,a,b, C',D,E,F,G,A,B}. There are at most 200 notes in a song, and the song
maybe empty.
