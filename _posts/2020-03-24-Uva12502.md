title: Uva 12502  Three Families
---


## Input

```
Three families share a garden. They usually clean the garden together at the end of each week, but last
week, family C was on holiday, so family A spent 5 hours, family B spent 4 hours and had everything
done. After coming back, family C is willing to pay $90 to the other two families. How much should
family A get? You may assume both families were cleaning at the same speed.

$90/(5+4)*5=$50? No no no. Think hard. The correct answer is $60. When you figured out why,
answer the following question: If family A and B spent x and y hours respectively, and family C paid
$z, how much should family A get? It is guaranteed that both families should get non-negative integer
dollars.

WARNING: Try to avoid floating-point numbers. If you really need to, be careful!
```

## Output

```
The first line contains an integer T (T  100), the number of test cases. Each test case contains three
integers x, y, z (1  x, y  10, 1  z  1000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print an integer, representing the amount of dollars that family A should get.
