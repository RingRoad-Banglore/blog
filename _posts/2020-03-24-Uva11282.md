title: Uva 11282  Mixing Invitations
---


## Input

```text
Kelly is having a birthday party soon, and would like
to invite all her friends to come. There is one problem
though: her house is far too small to accommodate every-
one! She has already written up personalised invitations to
all her friends with corresponding addressed envelopes to
mail them in, and now she doesnt know what to do.

Luckily, Alex has thought of a clever way to help Kelly
out. He knows that if a friend receives an invitation per-
sonalised to him or her, that friend will definitely come to
the party. However, if a friend receives an invitation per-
sonalised to someone else (ie. the wrong invitation), that
friend will surely not come to the party. Alex then goes to
mix up Kellys invitations and envelopes so that some in-
vitations may be mailed to the wrong addressee. This way
everyone still gets an invitation and nobody is left out, but no more people would come than would fit
into Kellys house.

There are exactly as many envelopes as there are invitations, and each invitation has a corresponding
envelope with the same addressee. Alex must place each invitation into an envelope in such a way
that there are no more invitations in their correct envelopes than the amount of people Kelly can
accommodate.

Being the clever mathematician that he is, Alex would like to count the number of ways that he
can mix up the invitations and envelopes to accomplish his goal. Can you write a program to do this
for Alex?

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each on a separate line. Each line contains two positive
integers, N and M , separated by a space. N (1  N  20) is the number of invitations Kelly has
written, and M (0  M  N) is the maximum number of people Kelly can accommodate.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output on a separate line a single integer: the number of ways Alex can mix up the
invitations and envelopes to accomplish his goal.
