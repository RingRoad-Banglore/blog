title: Uva 00858  Berry Picking

## Input

```text
It is not easy for a bird to find food when winter approaches. The fields become empty and all the
crops have been harvested. There are only some wild berries that can be picked, but their location is
sometimes hidden.

We will help the birds find food. A bird looks for food by flying over a field and scanning it for the
edible berries. Suppose that we are given the shape of a berry area in the field and we want to decide
whether it is useful for the bird to cross the field along a chosen line. The flight is considered useful if
the bird flies over an extension of berries that exceeds some threshold length.

We will view a berry area as a polygon where vertices are approximated by integer values. Birds
always follow vertical lines in their flight, and never fly over the vertices of the polygon: in those points
there are usually scarecrows that frighten them.

Your task is to decide if the flight along a given line is useful. You will be given a sequence of
coordinates defining the berry area, a value for the threshold and the x-coordinate of the line to be
followed by the bird.

As an example, the following figure illustrates the
location of a berry area in a field, where line1 and
line2 are possible flight paths. If the threshold is
set to 2 length units, line 2 will be an interesting flight
path but line 1 will be not.

Given the shape of the berry area, the threshold
and the x-coordinate of the line to be followed by the
bird, decide whether the line is useful. Assume that
the given x-coordinate does not intersect the polygon
at any vertex.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains the number T of
test cases, followed by T input blocks.

The first line of each inpt block consists of one
integer N , the number of vertices of the polygon rep-
resenting the berry area. Each of the following N in-
put lines contains the X-Y integer coordinates of one
vertex. The following line has an integer indicating
the threshold for the decision. The last line of each
input block has an integer for the x-coordinate to be
evaluated. The set of vertices starts at an arbitrary
point in the polygon and there are at most 10000 vertices in a polygon.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input block output a single line, containing YES if the chosen line is useful and NO otherwise.
