title: Uva 11195  Another nQueen Problem
---


## Input

```
I guess the n-queen problem is known by every person who has
studied backtracking. In this problem you should count the num-
ber of placement of n queens on an n  n board so that no two
queens attack each other. To make the problem a little bit harder
(easier?), there are some bad squares where queens cannot be
placed. Please keep in mind that bad squares cannot be used to
block queens attack.

Even if two solutions become the same after some rotations
and reflections, they are regarded as different. So there are ex-
actly 92 solutions to the traditional 8-queen problem.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of at most 10 test cases. Each case contains
one integers n (3  n  15) in the first line. The following n lines represent the board, where empty
squares are represented by dots ., bad squares are represented by asterisks *. The last case is followed
by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the number of solutions.
