title: Uva 10680  LCM
---


## Input

```text
All of you know about LCM (Least Common Multiple). For example LCM of 4 and 6 is 12. LCM can
also be defined for more than 2 integers. LCM of 2, 3, 5 is 30. In the same way we can define LCM of
first N integers. The LCM of first 6 numbers is 60.

As you will see LCM will increase rapidly with N . So we are not interested in the exact value of
the LCM but we want to know the last nonzero digit of that. And you have to find that effeciently.
```

## Output

```text
Each line contains one nonzero positive integer which is not greater than 1000000. Last line will contain
zero indicating the end of input. This line should not be processed. You will need to process maximum
1000 lines of input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, print in a line the last nonzero digit of LCM of first 1 to N integers.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
5
10
0

```
