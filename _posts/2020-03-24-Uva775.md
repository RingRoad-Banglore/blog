title: Uva 00775  Hamiltonian Cycle
---


## Input

```text

A few definitions first:

Definition 1 A graph G = (V, E) is called dense if for each pair of non-adjacent vertices u and v,
d(u) + d(v)  n where n = |V | and d() denotes the degree of the vertex .

Definition 2 A Hamiltonian cycle on G is a sequence of vertices (vi1vi2 . . . vinvi1) such that vil = vih
for all l = h and {vil , vil+1} is an edge of G.

The problem is: write a program that, given a dense indirect graph G = (V; E) as input, deter-
mines whether G admits a Hamiltonian cycle on G and outputs that cycle, if there is one, or outputs
N if there is none.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several descriptions of graphs (each one ending with a %), in the form:

n1
ui1 uj1
ui2 uj2
. . .

%

n2
ui1 uj1
ui2 uj2
. . .

%

where ni is the number of vertices (0 < ni  256) and uih uil are integers between 1 and ni indicating
that there exists an edge between vertex uih and uil

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line that must contain the sequence of vertices that form a Hamiltonian
cycle in the form:

ui1 ui2 ui3 . . .

or containing:

N
