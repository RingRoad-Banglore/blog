```
When I was born, I was 5  2 Sorry for non-Chinese people. Heres what it means:

1  =0.5kg
1  =0.05kg

So 5  2  means 0.5*5+0.05*2=2.6kg.

Given similar information for other babies, your task is to find out their weights in kg.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case contains a string in format
a  b  (1  a  10, 1  b  9) or a  (1  a  10).

The input file will be encoded with UTF-8 without BOM (if you dont know what it is, you can
safely ignore it).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the ACCURATE weight in kg (without trailing zeros).

```

## Sample Input

```
3
5  2 
7  3 
6 

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 2.6
Case 2: 3.65
Case 3: 3
```
