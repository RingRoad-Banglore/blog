title: Uva 00987  Maternity

```

The government of Coviland has decided to close down the maternity services in some smaller hospitals,
so that better care can be provided to mothers-to-be and their babies in a few central facilities that are
modern, technologically-advanced and fully-equipped for the task.

This way the government will also save some public money, it is argued. On the other hand, some
mothers-to-be will have to travel further than usual to deliver their babies, and spend more of their
own money for that.

Acknowledging this, the minister decided to choose the maternities to close in a way that minimizes
the extra cost on the women that give birth further than usual. Your task is to write a program to help
the minister chose, or better still, a program that does the choice for the minister.

Your program will be given the list of cities in Coviland, the population and location of each, plus
the list of cities whose hospitals currently have maternity services and also the number of services that
must be closed down. It then computes the list of services that should be closed down, so that the total
extra cost to be supported by all the mothers-to-be in traveling to the closest available service is kept
to a minimum.

Coviland is a well managed country in which all cities are connected by a grid of roads, all of
them running either north-south or east-west. (Actually, the town planners of New York City got their
inspiration for the layout of the streets and avenues of Manhattan from the road network of Coviland.)

You can assume that all cities are equally fertile, i.e., the number of babies to be born to parents
living in a certain city is proportional to the population of that city. Furthermore, note the cost of giving
birth in Coviland is just the cost of traveling to the nearest open maternity, and this is proportional to
the distance traveled.

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive
test cases are separated by a single blank line.

The first line of the input file contains a positive integer, C, the number of cities, 0 < C  100.
Each of the following C lines contains a unique non-empty string, representing the city name, a positive
integer, representing the population of that city, and two integer numbers, representing the Euclidean
coordinates of the city in Coviland units, all separated by a space. Next, comes a line with a positive
integer, M , the number of cities currently having maternity services 0 < M  C and M  20. The
following M lines contain the list of such cities. Next, comes the last line, with a single positive integer,
N , the number of services to close down, 0 < N < M and N  10. Names of cities in Coviland are
written in lowercase only, using the 26 Latin letters, with no embedded spaces, and their length is 31
or less.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The output file contains N lines (where N is the number of services to close down), representing
the list of cities whose services will close down. This list is alphabetically sorted. In case of a tie, i.e.,
if two or more sets of cities would minimize the total extra cost, your program should choose the one
that is lexicographically least. (This means that, for example, of the two sets {aaa, ccc, hhh}
and {aaa, ddd, fff}, your program should prefer the former.)
