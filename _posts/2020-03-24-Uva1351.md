title: Uva 01351  String Compression
---


## Input

```text

Run Length Encoding(RLE) is a simple form of compression. RLE consists of the process for searching
for a repeated runs of a single character in a string to be compressed, and replacing them by a single
instance of the character and a run count. For example, a string abcccddddddefgggggggggghijk is
encoded into a string ab3c6def10ghijk by RLE.

A new compression method similar to RLE is devised and the rule of the method is as follows: if a
substring S is repeated k times, replace k copies of S by k(S). For example, letsgogogo is compressed
into lets3(go). The length of letsgogogo is 10, and the length of lets3(go) is 9. In general, the
length of k(S) is (number of digits in k) + (length of S) + 2 (for ( and )). For example, the length
of 123(abc) is 8. It is also possible to nest compression, so the substring S may itself be a compressed
string. For example, nowletsgogogoletsgogogo could be compressed as a now2(lets3(go)), and
nowletsgogogoletsgogogoandrunrunrun could be compressed as now2(lets3(go))and3(run).

Write a program that, for a given string, gives a shortest compressed string using the compression
rules as described above.
```

## Output

```text
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case consists of a single line containing one
string of no more than 200 characters drawn from a lower case alphabet. The length of shortest input
string is 1.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. For each test
case, print the length of the shortest compressed string.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4

ababcd

letsgogogo

nowletsgogogoletsgogogo

nowletsgogogoletsgogogoandrunrunrun

```
