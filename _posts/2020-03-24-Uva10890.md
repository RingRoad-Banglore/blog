title: Uva 10890  Maze
---


## Input

```text
In this problem you are given a square maze of dimension N with N N blocks. Each block is numbered
as follows:

N  1,0 N  1,1       N  1,N  1

              

2,0 2,1 2,2      

1,0 1,1 1,2      

0,0 0,1 0,2    0,N  1

The maze has only one entry which is at (0, 0) and only one exit which is at (N  1, N  1). From
each block you can move in four directions (N, E, W, S) and the cost is 1 for each movement among
the maze but collecting treasure does not require any cost. Some blocks contain treasures that you will
have to collect. Suppose there are T treasures in the maze and you have to collect at least S (S  T )
treasures from them. In this problem, you are requested to find an optimal way from starting location
to ending location and take at least S treasures from the maze. Remember that, you can visit a block
more than once if you want.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains three integers N (N  30), T (T  30) and S (S  10 and S  T )
describing the dimension of the maze, number of treasures in the maze and number of treasures that
you can take. After that, there are T lines. Each line contains two numbers representing the position
of the treasure in the maze. The input may contain multiple test cases and ends with three zeros for
N , T and S.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Each test case produces one line of output. This line should contain the output serial no as shown in the
sample output and a number representing the minimum cost which is required to collect the treasures.
