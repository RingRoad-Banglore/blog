title: Uva 11158  Elegant Permuted Sum
---


```
You will be given n integers < A1A2A3 . . . An >. Find a permutation of these n integers so that
summation of the absolute differences between adjacent elements is maximized.

Suppose n = 4 and the given integers are <4 2 1 5>. The permutation <2 5 1 4> yields the
maximum summation.

For this permutation sum = abs(2 5) + abs(5 1) + abs(1 4) = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10.
Of all the 24 permutations, you wont get any summation whose value exceeds 10. We will call this

value, 10, the elegant permuted sum.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 100) that represents the number of test cases. Each case
consists of a line that starts with n (1 < n < 51) followed by n non-negative integers separated by a
single space. None of the elements of the given permutation will exceed 1000.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the case number followed by the elegant permuted summation.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
4 4 2 1 5
4 1 1 1 1
2 10 1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 10
Case 2: 0
Case 3: 9
```
