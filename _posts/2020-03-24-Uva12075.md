title: Uva 12075  Counting Triangles
---


```
Triangles are polygons with three sides and strictly positive area. Lattice triangles are the triangles
all whose vertexes have integer coordinates. In this problem you have to find the number of lattice
triangles in an M  N grid. For example in a (1  2) grid there are 18 different lattice triangles as
shown in the picture below:
```

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 21 sets of inputs.

Each set of input consists of two integers M and N (0 < M,N  1000). These two integers denote
that you have to count triangles in an (M N) grid.

Input is terminated by a case where the value of M and N are zero. This case should not be
processed.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This output contains the serial of output followed by
the number lattice triangles in the (M N) grid. You can assume that number of triangles will fit in
a 64-bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Input

```
1 1
1 2
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 4
Case 2: 18
```
