One of the apparently intelligent tricks that enthousiastic psychologists persuade mice to perform is
solving a maze. There is still some controversy as to the exact strategies employed by the mice when
engaged in such a task, but it has been claimed that the animal keepers eavesdropping on conversations
between the mice have heard them say things like I have finally got Dr. Schmidt trained. Everytime
I get through the maze he gives me food.

Thus when autonomous robots were first being built, it was decided that solving such mazes would
be a good test of the intelligence built into such machines by their designers. However, to their chagrin,
the first contest was won by a robot that placed a sensor on the right-hand wall of the maze and sped
through the maze maintaining contact with the right-hand wall at all times. This led to a change in
the design of mazes, and also to the interest in the behaviour of such robots. To test this behaviour the
mazes were modified to become closed boxes with internal walls. The robot was placed in the south
west corner and set of pointing east. The robot then moved through the maze, keeping a wall on its
right at all times. If it can not proceed, it will turn left until it can proceed. All turns are exact right
angles. The robot stops when it returns to the starting square. The mazes were always set up so that
the robot could move to at least one other square before returning. The researchers then determined
how many squares were not visited and how many were visited one, twice, thrice and four times. A
square is visited if a robot moves into and out of it. Thus for the following maze, the values (in order)
are: 2, 3, 5, 1, 0.

Write a program to simulate the behaviour of such a robot and collect the desired values.
```

## Input

```
Input will consist of a series of maze descriptions. Each maze description will start with a line containing
the size of the maze (b and w), This will be followed by b lines, each consisting of w characters, either
0 or 1. Ones represent closed squares, zeroes represent open squares. Since the maze is enclosed, the
outer wall is not specified. The file will be terminated by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Output

```
Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each maze. Each line will consist of 5 integer values
representing the desired values, each value right justified in a field of width 3.
