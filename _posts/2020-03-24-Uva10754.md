title: Uva 10754  Fantastic Sequence
---


## Input

```
A fantastic sequence ai is defined in the following way: a0, . . . , ak1 are given integers, and the subse-
quent elements are defined by the linear recurrence relation

an =

(
k

i=1

cian1

)
+ ck+1  (n  k)

Here c1, . . . , ck+1 are known integers.
You have to find an mod m, where n and m are given.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains the number of the test cases, which is at most 20. The descriptions
of the test cases follow. The first line of a test case description contains three integers k (0  k  20),
m (1  m < 231), and n (0  n < 231) separated by spaces. The second line contains the integers
c1, . . . , ck+1 separated by spaces (231  ci < 231). The third line contains the integers a0, . . . , ak1
separated by spaces (231  ai < 231). The test cases are separated by blank lines.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input, output one nonnegative integer: an mod m. Print a blank line between
test cases.

```

## Sample Output

```
1

2 10 10
1 1 0
1 1

```
