11156 Continuous Drawing
A simple task!! You will be given the end points of some line segments. Just draw them. Too easy,
right???

You decide to challenge yourself and
thus plan to add some constraints.

1. Start from the end point of any line
segment.

2. Do not lift your pen off the paper.

3. You can go over a line more than
once.

4. Do not draw any line other than the
ones mentioned.

5. You can only change direction at in-
teger coordinates of x & y.

6. Use the least amount of ink needed.

You need 1 unit of ink to draw one unit of line. Distances between successive points are 1 unit.
So Distance (A1 to B1) = 1 unit and Distance (A1 to A2) = 1 unit.

## Input
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 20) that indicates the total number of test cases. Each case
starts with an integer N (N < 10). Then N lines follow, each describing a line segment. A line segment
is defined by two points Y1X1 Y2X2. Y1 and Y2 will be from [A,E]. X1 and X2 will be from [1,5]. The
first sample is taken from the figure above. So look at the sample for exact format.

## Output
For each case, output the case number followed by the total amount of ink requried with 2 digits after
the decimal point. If the lines cant be drawn without lifting the pen then print ‘˜x(’ instead.
