```
Yes, as you have apprehended the Useless Tile Packers (UTP) pack tiles. The tiles are of uniform
thickness and have simple polygonal shape. For each tile a container is custom-built. The floor of the
container is a convex polygon and under this constraint it has the minimum possible space inside to
hold the tile it is built for. But this strategy leads to wasted space inside the container.

The UTP authorities are interested to know the percentage of wasted space for a given tile.
```

## Input

```
The input file consists of several data blocks. Each data block describes one tile. The first line of a data
block contains an integer N (3  N  100) indicating the number of corner points of the tile. Each
of the next N lines contains two integers giving the (x, y) co-ordinates of a corner point (determined
using a suitable origin and orientation of the axes) where 0  x, y  1000. Starting from the first point
given in the input the corner points occur in the same order on the boundary of the tile as they appear
in the input. No three consecutive points are co-linear.

The input file terminates with a value of 0 for N .

```

## Output

```
For each tile in the input output the percentage of wasted space rounded to two digits after the decimal
point. Each output must be on a separate line.

Print a blank line after each output block.
