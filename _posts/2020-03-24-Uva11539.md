```

This is just another word game. You are given a dictionary of words. Each of the word has a weight
W , which is an integer value. You are given another string S. Initially your score is zero. In each turn
you can mark some consecutive characters. If these consecutive characters create a word in the given
dictionary, corresponding weight will be added to your score, otherwise a penalty P will be subtracted
word length times from your score. Here word length is number of character in a word, and P is an
integer value. What is the maximum score you can gain?

Note that your have to make a move until all characters of S are marked, and you cannot mark one
character more than once.

test case starts with two integer N (N  10000) and P (0  P  10000). Here N is the number of
words in the dictionary and P is the value of Penalty. Each of the next N lines will contain a word and
corresponding integer weight W (0  W  10000). No word of this dictionary will contain more than
100 characters, and a word will only contain lower case alphabet (a, b, . . . , z). The last line of the
