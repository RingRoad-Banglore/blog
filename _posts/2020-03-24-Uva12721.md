title: Uva 12721  Cheap B-Subsequence
---


## Input

```text

Some time ago, Dejan Stojanovic, a Serbian poet, said: Words rich in meaning can be cheap in sound
effects. Is it true? A String Processing professor at UFPE wants to test this quote with strings. For
that, he defined what he calls a cheap B-subsequence. A cheap B-subsequence, according to his
definition, is a subsequence of size B, of a string S (B  |S|), that has the lowest associated cost. To
define the cost of a string, the professor determined a series of rules to each letter of the alphabet. The
alphabet that he used contains only lowercase letters. The rule of a letter is defined as a set of pairs
(Pi, Ci), which indicates that if this letter appears in a position X on the subsequence, where X is a
multiple of Pi, then the cost of (X/Pi)  Ci will be added to the total cost of this subsequence. Lets
show an example. Suppose we have the following rules:

[a] = {(2, 3), (4, 10)}
[b] = {(1, 4), (7, 50)}
[c] = {(1, 2), (4, 20)}

[d..z] = { } // there are no rules for the characters d to z

Suppose we have the string abaabcbc, and B = 4. If we choose the subsequence aabc (abaabcbc),
we would do the following procedure to calculate the associated cost:

1. The first letter of the sequence is an a, and the position 1 is neither multiple of 2 or 4, so the
cost is 0;

2. The second letter of the sequence is another a, and the position 2 is a multiple of 2, so well add
the cost of (2

2
)  3 = 3;

3. The third letter of the sequence is a b, and the position 3 is multiple of 1, so we will add the
cost of (3

1
)  4 = 12;

4. The last letter of the sequence is a c, and the position 4 is a multiple of 1 and 4, so we will add
the cost of (4

1
)  2 + (4

4
)  20 = 28.

The total associated cost to this subsequence is 43, which is not the lowest cost, since we could have
chosen aaab (abaabcbc) and obtained an associated cost of 19  this is indeed the cost of the cheap
B-subsequence. Given the string S and the integer B, and the rules of the alphabet, your task is to
create a program that tells the professor the cost of the cheap B-subsequence.

## Output

```text
The first line contains T (T  100)  the number of test cases, after this line T test cases follows. The
first line of a test case contains a string S of lowercase letters and an integer B (1  B  |S|  100).
Each of the next 26 lines describe the rule of each letter. The first of the 26 lines corresponds to the
rule of the letter a; the following line corresponds to the rule of the letter b; the last of the 26 lines
corresponds to the rule of the letter z. Each line containing a rule is described in the following way:
Q P1 C1 P2 C2 . . . PQ CQ (1  Q  10; 1  Pi  |S|; 1  Ci  50), where Q is the amount of pairs
associated to this rule, and is followed by the pairs themselves.
