title: Uva 01554  Binary Search
---


## Input

```

The program fragment below performs binary search of an integer number in an array that is sorted in
a nondescending order:

Pascal (file sproc.pas)

const

MAXN = 10000;

var

A: array[0..MAXN-1] of integer;

N: integer;

procedure BinarySearch(x: integer);

var

p, q, i, L: integer;

begin

p := 0; {Left border of the search}
q := N-1; {Right border of the search}
L := 0; {Comparison counter}
while p <= q do begin

i := (p + q) div 2;

inc(L);

if A[i] = x then begin

writeln(Found item i = , i,

 in L = , L,  comparisons);

exit

end;

if x < A[i] then

q := i - 1

else

p := i + 1

end

end;

C (file sproc.c)

#define MAXN 10000

int A[MAXN];

int N;

void BinarySearch(int x)

{
int p, q, i, L;

p = 0; /*Left border of the search*/

q = N-1; /*Right border of the search*/

L = 0; /*Comparison counter*/

while (p <= q) {
i = (p + q) / 2;

++L;

if (A[i] == x) {
printf("Found item i = %d"

" in L = %d comparisons", i, L);

return;

}
if (x < A[i])

q = i - 1;

else

p = i + 1;

}
}

Before BinarySearch was called, N was set to some integer number from 1 to 10000 inclusive and
array A was filled with a nondescending integer sequence.

It is known that the procedure has terminated with the message Found item i = XXX in L =
Y Y Y comparisons with some known values of i and L.

Your task is to write a program that finds all possible values of N that could lead to such message.
However, the number of possible values of N can be quite big. Thus, you are asked to group all
consecutive Ns into intervals and write down only first and last value in each interval.
```

## Output

```
The input file consists of several datasets. Each datasets consists of a single line with two integers i
and L (0  i < 10000 and 1  L  14), separated by a space.

```

## Sample Input

```
On the first line of each dataset write the single integer number K representing the total number of
intervals for possible values of N . Then K lines shall follow listing those intervals in an ascending order.
Each line shall contain two integers Ai and Bi (Ai  Bi) separated by a space, representing first and
last value of the interval.

If there are no possible values of N exist, then the output file shall contain the single 0.

## Sample Output
