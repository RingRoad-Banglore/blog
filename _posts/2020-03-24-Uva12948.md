## Input

```
The Agency for Cross-Constellation and Interstellar Space Travel (ACIS) is ready to offer its clients
space travel among several planets across the universe.

ACIS offers a list of flight options consisting of an origin planet, a destination planet, a cost, and
a duration. One of the killer features ACIS will offer to its clients is that of being able to plan a
trip between two planets under the constraint of a maximum number of stops. That is, given a natural
number n, ACIS would like to offer each client the cheapest possible trip from an origin planet to
a destination planet with at most n stops. Since interstellar in-flight sleep is not pleasant, it is also
important to minimize the amount of time spent in a trip.

Can you help ACIS in finding an efficient algorithm for such a task?
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with a line with three blank-separated
integers p, f , and q (1  p  300, 0  f  5000, and 0  q  1000), indicating the number of planets,
flights, and queries, respectively. The next p lines each contains a planet name s (1  |s|  30). The
next f lines each contains two planet names and two integers so, sd, c, and t (separated by a blank),
denoting that there is a direct flight from so to sd costing c dollars (0  c  105) with a duration of t
units of time (0  t  105). The next line contains a planet name si indicating the initial planet for
the trip. The next q lines each contains a query with a destination planet name sf for the trip and
a natural number n, both separated by a blank (0  n  300). You can assume that planet names
consist only of alphabetic characters, and that so, sd, si, and sf are in the list of p planet names.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each query si, sf , n output two blank-separated integers indicating the minimum cost and the
corresponding minimum travel time for this cost of an interstellar trip from si to sf with at most n
stops. If this is not possible, then print two blank-separated asterisks (*).

Print a line with a single period (.) between consecutive test cases.
