10699 Count the factors
Write a program, that computes the number of different prime factors in a positive integer.

## Input
The input tests will consist of a series of positive integers. Each number is on a line on its own. The
maximum value is 1000000. The end of the input is reached when the number ‘0’ is met. The number
‘0’ shall not be considered as part of the test set.

## Output
The program shall output each result on a line by its own, following the format given in the sample
output.

## Sample Input
<p>289384</p><p>930887</p><p>692778</p><p>636916</p><p>747794</p><p>238336</p><p>885387</p><p>760493</p><p>516650</p><p>641422</p><p>0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>289384 : 3</p><p>930887 : 2</p><p>692778 : 5</p><p>636916 : 4</p><p>747794 : 3</p><p>238336 : 3</p><p>885387 : 2</p><p>760493 : 2</p><p>516650 : 3</p><p>641422 : 3</p>
