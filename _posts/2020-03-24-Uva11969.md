```
LAMAbpo is a Lithuanian organization which decides whether to admit the student to university or
not. In this task your are required to write an application for a part of the LAMAbpo system. Given
the score for each of the study programmes included in the application of high-school graduates you
have to find the results of the admissions.

Essentially, the application includes: the list of study programmes ordered by priority from highest
to lowest (application entry) and the personal data of a graduate. The contest is performed as indicated
in the rules below:

 First, the highest priority study programme is considered. If the contestants score is enough,
then he is admitted to this course and other courses are not considered.

 If the score is not enough the next study programme in the application is considered.

 The algorithm proceeds until the application entry is found where the contestant meets the re-
quirements (i.e. the score is big enough) or all entries are marked as considered.

Be aware, that if you mark an entry as considered you must be sure that either a contestant may
not be accepted to the study programme or he must be accepted to this study programme.

of the following lines:

 First name and last name of a high-school graduate (at most 100 characters)
