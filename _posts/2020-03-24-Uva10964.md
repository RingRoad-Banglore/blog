title: Uva 10964  Strange Planet

## Input

```text
As you know, there are many strange planets in the universe. Dara and Sara are living in one of these
strange planets with an unusual coordinate system. This Planet is like a grid having unit-sized cells
with the houses considered as points placed in the center of cells. The cells are assigned a unique
number as shown in figure 1.

Figure 1. The Strange Planet

Recently, Dara and Sara have become familiar with the well-known Cartesian coordinate system
based on X and Y axes, and would like to know the Euclidian distance between their houses. Unfor-
tunately, they dont know how to calculate this distance. So, they need your help to calculate it. You
may assume that the cell with number 0 is located at the origin (with coordinate (0, 0)) of the Cartesian
coordinate system.
```

## Output

```text
Input file consists of many test-cases. Each test-case consists of two integers 0  a, b  1, 000, 000, 000
indicating the cell numbers that contain their houses. The input will be terminated with a line con-
taining two -1s.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test-case, print the Euclidian distance between the houses of Dara and Sara rounded to two
digits after the fraction point.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2 7
29 32
-1 -1

```
