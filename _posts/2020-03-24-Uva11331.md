## Input

```text
Farmer John owns b bulls and c cows. He also owns
b + c fields where each field can hold either one cow
or one bull. The fields are located in an area with
many hills, so for some pairs of fields the animals in
those fields cannot see each other. Unfortunately, his
bulls really do not like each other, and neither do his
cows. To avoid making any animal angry, John would
like to assign the animals to fields such that no two
bulls can see each other and no two cows can see each
other. Help determine if John can assign his bulls
and cows in such a manner.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains n, the number of examples. The first line of each example contains
integers b, c, and a where 0  b, c  1000 are, respectively, the number of bulls and cows and 0  a 
20, 000. The next a lines of input each contains two numbers u and v which indicates that animals
placed in fields u and v can see each other. Fields are numbered from 1 to b+ c.

```
