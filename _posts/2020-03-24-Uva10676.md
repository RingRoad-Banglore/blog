title: Uva 10676  Grid Points

## Input

```text
A charting component is a useful tool in many applications. Typically the component takes as input a set
of points and outputs a nice graph (for instance a scatter plot). One thing that is done automagically
by the component is deciding which grid points to use on the axes. Most people would agree that an
axis with grid points 0, 5, 10, looks nicer than an axis with the grid points 0, 3, 6, Your task is to
write a program which selects the grid points to use based on the points to plot and the number of
desired grid points. Since the x- and y-axes are independent of each other, we will only consider one
axis in this problem. Hence the plot points will be in a 1-dimensional space.

The following rules should be applied when selecting the grid points. The grid points should of
course always be evenly spaced, and should always include the origin (point 0). The only allowed (so
it looks nice) spacings of the grid points are 1, 2, 2.5 or 5 - or any multiple/divisible by 10 of these
values. The span between the lowest and highest grid point must always encompass (inclusive) all
points and the origin. So if the points to plot are 0.029, 0.185 and -0.095, a valid set of grid points are
-0.10, -0.05, 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20.

Furthermore, there should be no unnecessary grid points after the end points. Hence adding the
grid point 0.25 to the grid points above would not be allowed since the last point, 0.20, was enough to
encompass the rightmost plot point. However, if a more sparse grid spacing was used this grid point
would be allowed: the grid points -0.25, 0.00, 0.25 are perfectly valid for the plot points above.

The best choice of grid points is one that fulfills the criteria above and where the difference between
the number of grid points used and the desired number of grid points (given in the input) is minimized.
If there is a tie, select the set with most grid points. If still a tie, select the set with the smallest grid
spacing. For instance, if the desired number of grid points for a particular set of plot points is 6, and
the two best grid point sets requires 5 and 7 grid points, select the set containing 7 grid points.

## Output

```text
The first line in the input contains the number of test cases (no more than 100). Each test case contains
two lines. The first of these lines contains two integers, n (the number of plot points, 1 < n < 100) and
k (the desired number of grid points, 1 < k < 20). The second of these lines contains the n distinct
plot points, separated with a blank space. These points are real numbers, whose absolute values are
between 105 and 105, inclusive, and they will not have more than 5 digits after the decimal point.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a single line containing the best selection of grid points (according to the
rules above) in increasing order. Separate the grid points by exactly one space, and leave no trailing
spaces at the end of the line. All grid points in a test case should be printed with same number of
digits after the decimal point, and at least one of the grid points should not have trailing zeros after
the decimal point. Also make sure you dont print values such as -0.0.
