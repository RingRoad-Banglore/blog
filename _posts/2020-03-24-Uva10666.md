title: Uva 10666  The Eurocup is Here!

## Input

```text
We are the champions of the Eurocup! Well almost. Actually, we lost in first round and didnt win
any match. But we were beaten by the real champions so, optimistically, we could be the second! Cup
competitions are always unfair 

Lets consider a cup competition, that consists of N rounds where 2N teams take part. The winners
of each round proceed to the next round. So in round 1 there are 2N teams, in round 2 there are 2N1
teams, and so on. Teams are numbered 0, 1, 2, . . . , 2N  1. The matches in each round are scheduled
according to this order. Assume that, when two teams play, the one with the lowest number always
wins. In conclusion, in round 1 the matches are: (0 vs. 1), (2 vs. 3), (4 vs.5), ; in round 2: (0 vs. 2),
(4 vs. 6), The situation for N = 3 is shown in the picture below.

A team, X, is better than all the teams it has beaten, and it is worse than all the teams it has
lost with. Moreover, we can apply a sort of transitivity: X is better than all the team that are worse
than the teams that are worse than X; and X is worse than the teams that are better than the teams
that are better than X. For example, in the case of N = 3, team 7 is worse than 6, 4 and 0.

When the competition is finished, all teams are given a ranking from 1 to 2N (different for each
team, 1 for the winner, 2 for the subchampion, etc.). The ranking of team X is R(X). A valid
ranking has the following property: if X is better than Y , then R(X) < R(Y ). Obviously, there are
many possible valid rankings (because there are pairs of teams that we have no information between
them). We define the optimistic classification of a team X as the smallest value of R(X) for any
valid ranking R. Similarly, the pessimistic classification of X is the biggest value of R(X) for any
valid ranking R.

Given the number of rounds, N , and the number of a team, X, you have to compute the optimistic
and pessimistic classification of X.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer M , indicating the number of test cases. Each test case
consists of two integers N and X. N is the total number of rounds in the competition (0 < N < 31),
and X is the number of a team (0  X  2N  1).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output should consist of a single line with two integers: the optimistic and the
pessimistic classification of the corresponding team.
