Professor Hasmot Ali loves to play string related problem. He assigns an easy lab task to his students.
But they think its a hard problem. I know you are very smart. You can help his students to solve this
problem.

Given a string S, containing only lowercase English letters. There will be Q queries. Each line of
query will contain two space separated strings, X and Y . For every query, your task is to calculate,
how many distinct substrings of S which start with X and end with Y .

[Substring definition: A substring is any contiguous portion of a string. A substring may be empty,
or the entire string ]

For Example:

Given a string S = abab. There are total 8 distinct substrings. The list is below:

[0] = a
[1] = ab
[2] = aba
[3] = abab
[4] = b
[5] = ba
[6] = bab
[7] = 

There are 3 queries:

1st Query: X = a and Y = a.

There are 2 distinct substring of S, satisfy the condition( [0] = a and [2] =aba).

2nd Query: X = a and Y =b.

There are 2 distinct substring of S, satisfy the condition. ( [1] = ab and [3] = abab ).

3rd Query: X = ba and Y =ab.

There is only one distinct substring satisfy the condition.([6] = bab).
```

## Input

```
Input start with an integer T ( 3), denoting the number of test cases.
Each case starts with a line containing string S (1  length(S)  1000). The next line contains an

integer Q (1  Q  50000). Each of the next Q line contains two strings X (1  length(X)  10) and
Y (1  length(Y )  10).

```

## Output

```
For each query you have to print the number of distinct substring of S, which are start with X and
end with Y .
