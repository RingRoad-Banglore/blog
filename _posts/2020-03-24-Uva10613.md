```
The Institute of Ubiquitousness in Lichtenstein, LIU, conducts a project where the effect of a special
type of fungi, sphera carnelevarium, is studied. This fungus is very special, since it grows in a circular
fashion from its centre, without interference from other objects or other individuals.

Until now, the impact of this forest-living creature has been measured by examining a grid consisting
of nn squares of size 1 m2. A grid is considered affected, if fungi are present in the square, otherwise it
is considered clean. Grids, where the fungus merely touches the border of the square are not considered
affected.

Of course, the task of examining grids is tedious and now unnecessary, since Prof. Muggel discovered
that the grow rate is exactly 2.718281828 m/day. Now, counting the number of affected squares should
be like a stroll in the park, right? Since there are a lot of old data, which will be compared to the new
data, the rules of counting the squares must be the same. Do not use data types with unnecessary low
precision in your calculations.

```

## Input

```
On the first line of input there is one integer, N  10, giving the number of test cases in the input.
After this line, N test cases follows. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers size,
n such that 0 < size  1000000, 0 < n  1000, where size is the size of the grid in meters and n
is the number of individuals in the test grid. After this line, n lines follows, each line consisting of
three decimal number, 0  x  size, 0  y  size, 0 < r  size, where x and y are the zero-based
coordinates of the center of the individual and r is the (estimated) radius in meters.

```

## Output

```
For every test case, output one line containing the number of affected squares (a number between 0
and size2). However, the number of affected squares is always less than 1000000000 (109).
