title: Uva 10870  Recurrences
---


```
Consider recurrent functions of the following form:

f(n) = a1f(n 1) + a2f(n 2) + a3f(n 3) + . . .+ adf(n d), for n > d,

where a1, a2, , ad are arbitrary constants.
A famous example is the Fibonacci sequence, defined as: f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(n) = f(n  1) +

f(n 2). Here d = 2, a1 = 1, a2 = 1.
Every such function is completely described by specifying d (which is called the order of recurrence),

values of d coefficients: a1, a2, , ad, and values of f(1), f(2), , f(d). Youll be given these numbers,
and two integers n and m. Your programs job is to compute f(n) modulo m.
```

## Input

```
Input file contains several test cases. Each test case begins with three integers: d, n, m, followed by
two sets of d non-negative integers. The first set contains coefficients: a1, a2, , ad. The second set
gives values of f(1), f(2), , f(d).

You can assume that: 1  d  15, 1  n  231  1, 1  m  46340. All numbers in the input will
fit in signed 32-bit integer.

Input is terminated by line containing three zeroes instead of d, n, m. Two consecutive test cases
are separated by a blank line.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the value of f(n)(modm) on a separate line. It must be a non-negative integer,
less than m.
