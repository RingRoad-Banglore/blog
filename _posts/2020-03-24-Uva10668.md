title: Uva 10668  Expanding Rods
---


## Input

```
When a thin rod of length L is heated n degrees, it
expands to a new length L = (1 + n  C)  L, where
C is the coefficient of heat expansion.

When a thin rod is mounted on two solid walls
and then heated, it expands and takes the shape of a
circular segment, the original rod being the chord of
the segment.

Your task is to compute the distance by which the
center of the rod is displaced.
```

## Output

```
The input contains multiple lines. Each line of input
contains three non-negative numbers: the initial lenth
of the rod in millimeters, the temperature change in
degrees and the coefficient of heat expansion of the material. Input data guarantee that no rod expands
by more than one half of its original length. The last line of input contains three negative numbers and
it should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input, output one line with the displacement of the center of the rod in millimeters
with 3 digits of precision.

```

## Sample Output

```
1000 100 0.0001
15000 10 0.00006
10 0 0.001
-1 -1 -1

```
