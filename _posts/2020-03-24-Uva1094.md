title: Uva 01094  Channel

## Input

```text
Joe, a former champion coder, has finally bought the farm. No, no, hes alive and well; he merely made
use of his vast programming competition winnings to purchase his ancestral farm. He hopes to retire
and spend the rest of his days tending cows (for some reason, he now considers himself an expert on
cows).

Sadly, Farmer Joes simple bucolic ambitions are not to be. His farm is situated in a cold, northern
climate  too cold for cows! Whats worse, the climate is dry and ill-suited for growing crops. Joe now
realizes that he will have to set up an irrigation scheme for his field. This scheme involves diverting
part of a river into a long, winding channel through his field. Since the crops nearest the channel will
thrive, the longer the channel, the better.

His field is a long rectangular strip of land divided into unit
squares. Each square either has dirt, represented by ., or an
immovable rock, represented by #. The irrigation channel, which
is one square wide, enters his land in the upper left corner and
exits it in the lower right. The channel cannot pass through rocks,
of course. It is important that this channel never touches itself,
even at a corner (or else the water will seep through and take a
shortcut). Figure 3 and Figure 4 contain examples of the channel
touching itself.

Unfortunately, Joes best programming days are long behind him. He has a straightforward solution
but it turns out to be far too time consuming. Can you help him figure out the optimal placement of
this channel?

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing r, the number of rows
in his field (2  r  20), and c, the number of columns (2  c  9). The next r lines each contain a
string of length c, describing his field.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, display the case number. On the following r lines show how to place the longest
possible channel in the field, subject to the above restrictions. Use the character C for the channel.
There will always be a unique solution. Follow the format in the sample output. Print a blank line
after the output for each test case.
