title: Uva 12110  Gargoyle
---


```
Gargoyles can trace their history back many thousands of years
to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Terra cotta waterspouts
were formed in the shapes of animals such as lions and birds to
serve the physical function of running the rainwater away from
the walls and foundations of buildings, and the spiritual function
of protecting from evil forces.

Have you ever dreamed of creating your own castle with a
lot of beautiful gargoyles on the walls? To your knowledge, the
speed of water coming out of each gargoyle should be identical,
so an elaborately designed water system is required. The water
system consists of a huge reservoir and several interconnecting
water pipes. Pipes cannot save water, so the total incoming and
outgoing speed of water should be equal at each connection.

All the water from gargoyles flows into the reservoir, which is
located at the bottom of the castle. Some pipes are connecting
the reservoir, but water can only go from the reservoir to pipes,
but never from pipes back to the reservoir. A micro-processor is installed inside each pipe, so the speed
of water could easily be controlled. However, the microprocessors consume electricity. The exact cost in
each pipe is proportional to the speed of water. If the cost constant in the i-th pipe is ci, the electricity
cost in that pipe is civi, where vi is the speed of water in that pipe.

Write a program to find the optimal configuration of the water system (i.e. the water speed in each
pipe) of your dream castle, so that the total cost is minimized. It is always possible to build a water
system.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains three integers n, m and
k (1  n  25, 1  m  50, 1  k  1000), the number of gargoyles, the number of pipe connections
and the number of pipes. The following k lines each contains five integers a, b, l, u, c (0  a, b 
n + m, 0  l  u  100, 1  c  100), describing each pipe. a and b are the incoming and outgoing
vertex number (reservoir is 0, gargoyles are numbered 1 to n, pipe connections are numbered n+ 1 to
n + m), lower-bound and upper-bound of water speed, and the cost constant. No pipe connects two
identical vertices. For every pipe, the incoming vertex will never be a gargoyle, and the outgoing vertex
will never be the reservoir. For every pair of vertices, there could be at most one pipe connecting them
(if a pipe is going from a to b, no pipes can go from a to b, or from b to a). The last test case is followed
by a single zero, which should not be processed.

For each test case, print the case number and minimal cost to two decimal places.
