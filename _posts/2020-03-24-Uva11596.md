## Input

```text
In Cartesian coordinate system a lattice point is a point whose abscissa and ordinate is integer. For
example (3, 4) is a lattice point but (4.5, -10) is not a lattice point. If all the vertices of a polygon
are lattice points then this polygon is called a lattice polygon. For this problem a lattice polygon is
orthogonal when all its sides are parallel to x-axis or y-axis. An orthogonal lattice polygon is convex
when there is no such horizontal or vertical line segment that connects two points within the polygon
and has some parts of it outside the polygon. The bounding box of an orthogonal convex polygon is
the smallest rectangle (With axis-parallel sides) that contains the entire polygon.

Figure 1: A orthogonal convex polygon and its
bounding box (Shown with red).

Figure 2: A orthogonal concave polygon and its
bounding box (Shown with red)

Figure 3: At step zero we have a polygon
which is painted dark blue. The growth in
step 1 and 2 are shown by filling them with
lighter blue colors.

Now you have to deal with the growth of a Orthog-
onal Convex lattice polygon. Suppose the area of an
orthogonal convex lattice polygon (OCLP) at step zero
is A0 and the area of its bounding box is B0. But you
have forgotten other details about this polygon (Like co-
ordinate of its vertices). In the next step this polygon
grows by one unit in horizontal and vertical direction as
shown in the figure 3 and its area becomes A1. This pro-
cess continues and after n steps the area of the polygon
becomes An. Now given the value of A0, An and B0 you
will have to find out the value of n if possible.

## Output

```text
Input file can contain up to 50000 lines of inputs. Each
line contains three positive integers which denotes the
values of A0 (0 < A0  10000), An (A0  An  1018)
and B0 (0 < B0 < 20000) respectively.

Input is terminated by a line containing three zeroes.
This case need not be processed.

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one or more lines of output. These lines contain the possible values of n
(one in each line). If there is more than one possible value of n print those in ascending order. If the
given input values are impossible print a -1 instead.

Print a blank line after the output for each set of input.
