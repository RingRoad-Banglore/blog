title: Uva 00868  Numerical Maze
---


```
No one knows who is the creator of the first maze (or labyrinth), but all sorts of mazes can be found
almost everywhere and some of them have been built long time ago. The most famous maze is maybe
the one in Crete, drawn and built by Daedalus for the king Minos, a place where it is believed the
Minotaur (a monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man) was kept, feeding on human flesh,
until destroyed by Theseus.

The following figure illustrates a kind of maze.

Figure 3.1 - The maze

Are you able to find a path that takes you from the start to exit of the maze? You are only
allowed to move horizontally or vertically  diagonal movements are not permitted. The path consists
of subsequences obeying to the following rule: 1; 1, 2; 1, 2, 3; 1, 2, 3, 4; and so on. Subsequences may
include changes of direction.

The problem you have to solve is to determine an entry point and a path that takes you to the exit
point, for a given maze. The start point is always a cell in the top row of the maze (with the value 1!)
and the exit point is always a cell in the last line of the maze.

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first input line contains two positive integers N and M for the number of rows and columns of
the maze, respectively. Each of the N subsequent lines contains the M cell values, separated by single
spaces. Cell values are greater or equal to 1.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

Two lines, the first with the coordinates, row and column, of the starting cell, and the second with
the coordinates of the exit cell. If there are several solutions, print the one with lexicographically
smallest starting point. If still a tie, print the one with lexicographically smallest ending point.
