title: Uva 12338  AntiRhyme Pairs
---


```
Often two words that rhyme also end in the same sequence of characters. We use this property to
define the concept of an anti-rhyme. An anti-rhyme is a pair of words that have a similar beginning.
The degree of anti-rhyme of a pair of words is further defined to be the length of the longest string S
such that both strings start with S. Thus, arboreal and arcturus are an anti-rhyme pair of degree
2, while chalkboard and overboard are an anti-rhyme pair of degree 0.

You are given a list of words. Your task is, given a list of queries in the form (i, j), print the degree
of anti-rhyme for the pair of strings formed by the i-th and the j-th words from the list.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of a number of test cases. The first line of input contains the number of test cases T
(T  35). Immediately following this line are T cases.

Each case starts with the number of strings N (1  N  105) on a line by itself. The following N
lines each contain a single non-empty string made up entirely of lower case English characters (a to
z), whose length L is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 10,000. In every case it is guaranteed
that N  L  106.

The line following the last string contains a single integer Q (1  Q  106), the number of queries.
Each of the Q lines following contain a query made up of two integers i and j separated by whitespace
(1  i, j  N).

```

## Output

```
The output consists of T cases, each starting with a single line with Case X:, where X indicates
the X-th case. There should be exactly Q lines after that for each case. Each of those Q lines should
contain an integer that is the answer to the corresponding query in the input.
