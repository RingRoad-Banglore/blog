320 Border
You are to write a program that draws a border
around a closed path into a bitmap, as displayed in
the figure on the right:

The path is closed and runs along the grid lines,
i.e. between the squares of the grid. The path runs
counter-clockwise, so if following the path is consid-
ered as going “forward”, the border pixels are always
to the “right” of the path. The bitmap always covers
32 by 32 squares and has its lower left corner at (0,0).
You can safely assume that the path never touches the
bounding rectangle of the bitmap and never touches
or crosses itself. Note that a bit gets set if it is on
the outside of the area surrounded by the path and
if at least one of its edges belongs to the path, but
not if only one of its corners is in the path. (A look
at the convex corners in the figure should clarify that
statement.)

## Input
The first line of the input file contains the number of test cases in the file. Each test case that follows
consists of two lines. The first line of each case contains two integer numbers x and y specifying the
starting point of the path. The second line contains a string of variable length. Every letter in the string
symbolizes a move of length one along the grid. Only the letters ‘W’ (“west”), ‘E’ (“east”), ‘N’ (“north”),
‘S’ (“south”), and ‘.’ (“end of path”, no move) appear in the string. The end-of-path character (.) is
immediately followed by the end of the line.

## Output
For each test case, output a line with the number of the case (‘Bitmap #1’, ‘Bitmap #2’, etc.). For
each row of the bitmap from top to bottom, print a line where you print a character for every bit in
that row from left to right. Print an uppercase ‘X’ for set bits and a period ‘.’ for unset bits. Output
a blank line after each bitmap.
