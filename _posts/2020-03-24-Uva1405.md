title: Uva 01405  The Ultimate Password
---


```

A letter lock is a circle, in which we mark
some positions equidistant from one another.
The positions are numbered clockwise by a
zero-based index and there is exactly one En-
glish capital letter put in each position. The
state of the lock is given by a string, which con-
tains all letters enumerated from position 0 to
the end. The lock can change its state by per-
forming rotations: After a rotation, every letter
in the circle will move clockwise to the next po-
sition.

If the lock received a password in form of a string, it will step by step rotate to change its state
and verify whether its current state matches the prefix of the password. Whenever it matches, the lock
will be unlocked, and the verification process will stop successfully. If the lock moves around and there
has been no matched state found, it will delete the first character in the password and retry with the
new password, and so on. This process repeats until the lock is unlocked or the password has been
completely deleted (verification fails).

Given a sequence of N locks, in which the state of any lock is not shorter than the state of its
previous lock, one may want to unlock all of them in succession by only one password. The process is
as follows: the password is first applied to the first lock in the sequence; the remaining password after
unlocking the first lock will be applied again to the second lock, the remaining password after unlocking
the second lock will be applied again to the third lock, etc. The process continues until the last lock is
unlocked.

Your task is to write a program to find the shortest password (in terms of the number of characters)
that can be used to unlock all these N locks in succession. If there is more than one solution, just find
the first one in lexicographic order.
```

## Input

```
The input file consists of several data sets. The first line of the input file contains the number of data
sets which is a positive integer and is not bigger than 20. The following lines describe the data sets.

For each data set, there is only one line containing a string that lists all states of the locks separated
by one semicolon (;). In each test case, the number of locks is not greater than 200, the state of every
lock is not empty and consists of less than 101 letters.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write in one line the shortest password to unlock all the locks in succession.
