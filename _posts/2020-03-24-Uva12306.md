title: Uva 12306  My SketchUp
---


## Input

```text
Google SketchUp is an easy-to-use program that lets you create, modify and share 3D models. In this
problem, youre to write a simplified version of SketchUp called My SketchUp. Since 3D is complex,
My SketchUp will be in 2D only.

SketchUp is intuitive. To understand this, suppose youve drawn two line segments that intersect
other, like this:

Then, you click your mouse at the red dot. If youre using AutoCAD, youll select a whole segment
(shown in the middle picture), but in My SketchUp, youll only select a small segment (shown in the
right picture), because the two segment youve drawn cut each other! Whats more, if you remove two
small segments as shown below, the other two small segments will automatically join up to become
one segment again! Note that in the middle picture, you cannot select the long segment as a whole,
because its still cut into two pieces.

Here is the general rule: segments that intersect each other actually cut each other; and there will
be no redundant points that can be removed without affecting the appearance of the picture. As a
result, the in-memory data structure of the segments can be deduced merely from the appearance. If
two pictures look the same, they are the same internally. For example, if you draw (0,0)-(1,0),
then (1,0)-(2,0), youll have only one segment: (0,0)-(2,0), if you draw (0,0)-(1,0) twice, youll only
get one. In the picture below, there are 14 vertices and 15 segments (no matter how you draw this
picture!!).

Your task is to execute a sequence of commands (described in the input format section) and print
the description of the resulting picture. Vertices are sorted in ascending order of x, then ascending
order of y; Segments are represented by a pair of integers a and b (a < b), that means the segment is
connecting vertex a and vertex b (vertices are numbered from 1).

## Output

```text
There will be at most 25 test cases. Each case begins with one integer n (1  n  100), the number of
operations. Each of the following n lines is formatted as one of:

DRAW x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ...
or:

REMOVE x y d
In the draw operation, youre drawing a poly-line (x1, y1)(x2, y2)(x3, y3)..., note that if the last

point equals to the first point, youre actually drawing closed poly-line (but not necessarily a polygon,
since the poly-line could be self-intersecting. There will be at least 2 and at most 20 points in a draw
operation.

In the remove operation, all the line segments whose distance from (x, y) is at most d, are removed
simultaneously (be careful about this!). If no segments satisfy this condition, this operation takes no
effect. 1000  x1, y1, x2, y2  1000, 0  d  10.

There is a special command END following the last draw/remove operation. The last test case is
followed by a line with n = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the number of vertices, followed by the coordinates of the vertices (one vertex
per line), sorted as stated in the problem statement. The next line contains the number of segments,
followed by the descriptions of the segments.

Tips: In this problem, your output must match the standard output perfectly. In order to prevent you
from printing -0.00 instead of 0.00, youre encouraged to add to small number (e.g. 1e-6) to each
number you print.

```
