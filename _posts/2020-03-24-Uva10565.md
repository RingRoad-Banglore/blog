Preliminaries

(He who has already studied linear algebra may skip this part)
A matrix is composed of n n elements. Formally,

A =




a11 a12    a1n
a21 a22    a2n
...

...
. . .

...
an1 an2    ann




is an n n matrix.
For example,

A =

(
1 2
3 4

)
is a 2 2 matrix.

Two operations on matrices will be used in this problem:

1. A+ k (A is an n n matrix, k is an integer) all the elements in the MAIN diagonal is added by
k. That is

A+ k =




a11 + k a12    a1n
a21 a22 + k    a2n
...

...
. . .

...
an1 an2    ann + k




For example,
(
1 2
3 4

)
+ 5 =

(
6 2
3 9

)
A k is defined A+ (k), so

(
1 2
3 4

)
 5 =

(
4 2
3 1

)
2. A B (both A and B are n n matrices). Let

A =




a11 a12    a1n
a21 a22    a2n
...

...
. . .

...
an1 an2    ann


 , B =




b11 b12    b1n
b21 b22    b2n
...

...
. . .

...
bn1 bn2    bnn




and

C = AB =




c11 c12    c1n
c21 c22    c2n
...

...
. . .

...
cn1 cn2    cnn

then we have:

cij =

n
k=1

aikbkj = ai1b1j + ai2b2j +   + a1nbnj

For example,

(
1 2
3 4

)


(
5 6
7 8

)
=

(
5 + 14 6 + 16
15 + 28 18 + 32

)
=

(
19 22
43 50

)
Well, I have no time to explain why matrix multiplication is defined like this. Please just remember

it.

Problem

Find a matrix root of this equation: (A+ k1)(A+ k2)(A+ k3) . . . (A+ km) = 0 where k1, k2, . . . , km
are distinct integers.

That is, EVERY ELEMENT OF the matrix computed from the left is zero.
For example,

A =

(
1 2
3 4

)
is a matrix root of the equation (A+ 1)(A 5) = 0 since

(A+ 1)(A 5) =
(
1 2
3 4

)


(
4 4
2 2

)
=

(
8 + 8 8 8
8 + 8 8 8

)
=

(
0 0
0 0

)
It can be proven that there are infinitely many solutions, however, I do not like trivial answer, so

your answer must have at least (n  n)/2 non-zero elements.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of tests t (1  t  15). Each case contains two lines. The first line
contains an integer m (1  m  30). The second line contains m integers, representing k1, k2, . . . , km
respectively. Absolute values of the integers are no greater than 100.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, if no answer can be found, print -1. Otherwise print n, indicating that you found
an n  n matrix root. The following n lines should be the matrix. It is guaranteed that if there is an
answer, the smallest possible n is not greater than 50, so your n should also NOT be greater than 50.
The absolute value of integers you gave should not be larger than 1000.
