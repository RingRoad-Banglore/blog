## Input

```text

The International Corporation for Protection and Control (ICPC) develops efficient technology for,
well, protection and control. Naturally, they are keen to have their own headquarters protected and
controlled. Viewed from above, the headquarters building has the shape of a convex polygon. There are
several suitable places around it where cameras can be installed to monitor the building. Each camera
covers a certain range of the polygon sides (building walls), depending on its position. ICPC wants to
minimize the number of cameras needed to cover the whole building.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

Its first line contains two integers n and k (3  n  106 and 1  k  106), where n is the number
of walls and k is the number of possible places for installing cameras. Each of the remaining k lines
contains two integers ai and bi (1  ai, bi  n). These integers specify which walls a camera at the i-th
place would cover. If ai  bi then the camera covers each wall j such that ai  j  bi. If ai > bi then
the camera covers each wall j such that ai  j  n or 1  j  bi.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below, on a line by itself.

Display the minimal number of cameras that suffice to cover each wall of the building. The ranges
covered by two cameras may overlap. If the building cannot be covered, display impossible instead.
