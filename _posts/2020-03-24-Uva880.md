title: Uva 00880  Cantor Fractions
---


## Input

```text
In the late XIXth century the German mathematician George
Cantor argued that the set of positive fractions Q+ is equipotent
to the set of positive integers N, meaning that they are both
infinite, but of the same class. To justify this, he exhibited a
mapping from N to Q+ that is onto. This mapping is just traversal
of the N N plane that covers all the pairs:

The first fractions in the Cantor mapping are:

1

1
,
2

3

Write a program that finds the i-th Cantor fraction following
the mapping outlined above.
```

## Output

```text
The inputs consists of several lines with a positive integer number i each one.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of a line per input case, that contains the i-th fraction, with numerator and
denominator separed by a slash /. The fraction should not be in the most simple form.

```

## Sample Output

```text
6
