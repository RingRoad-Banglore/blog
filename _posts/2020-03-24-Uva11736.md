title: Uva 11736  Debugging RAM
---


## Input

```text
You are working in a robot factory. You are responsible to
write programs that run in the hardware of robots. You
have implemented your first program into a robot and turn
the robot on. But your robot is not acting according to
your program. You have decided to debug your program.
To do so, you have opened the robots brain and created
a copy of the whole RAM. The RAM contains different
things like interrupt service routines, functions, variables
etc. You are interested to look into what the variables hold
at a particular time. But since it is a tedious task, you have
decided to write another program to simplify your task.
```

## Output

```text
There will be several test cases in the input file. The first line of each test case starts with two positive
integers b  8 and v  200, where b is the number of bits in a byte and v is the total number of
variables in the RAM. These two integers will be separated by a single space. Each of the next v lines
will contain a variable name, si, and number of bytes that variable will occupy in RAM, ti, 1  i  v
and 1  ti  8. A variable name consists of lower case and upper case letters and the length of a
variable name is not more than 20. Variable names are case sensitive. It is guaranteed that no two
variable names are same in a set and all variables are unsigned. From the next line contents of the
RAM will start. There will be exactly vi=1ti lines and each line will have exactly b characters. Each
character in the RAM is either 0 or 1. First t1 lines are value for the variable s1, next t2 lines are value
for the variable s2 and so on. RAM contents are aligned as most significant byte first. Next line will
have single integer, 1  q  v, number of variables for which you need to output the content of variable.
Next q lines will each have a variable name. These variable names may or may not be one of the sis.

```

## Sample Input

```text
If it is one of the si, output the variable name, and equal sign = (quotes for clarity only), and contents
of the variable (in unsigned decimal number). If the queried variable name is not one of those sis, then
output the variable name and equal sign only.

For clarification, see sample input and output.
