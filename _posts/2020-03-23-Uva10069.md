10069 Distinct Subsequences
A subsequence of a given sequence is just the given sequence with some elements (possibly none) left
out. Formally, given a sequence X = x1x2 . . . xm, another sequence Z = z1z2 . . . zk is a subsequence
of X if there exists a strictly increasing sequence < i1, i2, . . . , ik > of indices of X such that for all
j = 1, 2, . . . , k, we have xij = zj . For example, Z = bcdb is a subsequence of X = abcbdab with
corresponding index sequence < 2, 3, 5, 7 >.

In this problem your job is to write a program that counts the number of occurrences of Z in X as
a subsequence such that each has a distinct index sequence.

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N indicating the number of test cases to follow. The
first line of each test case contains a string X, composed entirely of lowercase alphabetic characters
and having length no greater than 10,000. The second line contains another string Z having length no
greater than 100 and also composed of only lowercase alphabetic characters. Be assured that neither
Z nor any prefix or suffix of Z will have more than 10100 distinct occurrences in X as a subsequence.

## Output
For each test case in the input output the number of distinct occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence.

Output for each input set must be on a separate line.
