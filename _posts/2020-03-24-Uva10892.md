title: Uva 10892  LCM Cardinality
---


## Input

```text
A pair of numbers has a unique LCM but a single number can be the LCM of more than one possible
pairs. For example 12 is the LCM of (1, 12), (2, 12), (3,4) etc. For a given positive integer N , the
number of different integer pairs with LCM is equal to N can be called the LCM cardinality of that
number N . In this problem your job is to find out the LCM cardinality of a number.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 101 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer N (0 < N  2  109).
Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. This line contains two integers
N and C. Here N is the input number and C is its cardinality. These two numbers are separated by a
single space.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
12
24
101101291
0
