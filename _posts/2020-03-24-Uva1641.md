title: Uva 01641  ASCII Area
---


```

Long time ago, most of PCs were equipped with video cards that worked only in
text mode. If the programmer wanted to show a picture on a screen, he had to use
pseudographics or ASCII art like this on the right:

In this problem you are given a polygon, drawn using ASCII art. Your task is
to calculate its area.

The picture is formed using characters ., \, and /. Each character represents
a unit square of the picture. Character . represents an empty square, character
/  a square with a segment from the lower left corner to the upper right corner,
and character \  a square with a segment from the upper left corner to the lower
right corner.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line of each case contains integer numbers h and w (2  h,w  100)  height and width

of the picture. Next h lines contain w characters each  the picture drawn using ASCII art.
It is guaranteed that the picture contains exactly one polygon without self-intersections and self-

touches.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print to the output file one integer number  the area of the polygon.
