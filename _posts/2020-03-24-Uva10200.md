title: Uva 10200  Prime Time
---


## Input

```text
Euler is a well-known matematician, and, among many other things, he discovered that the formula
n2 + n+ 41 produces a prime for 0  n < 40. For n = 40, the formula produces 1681, which is 41  41.
Even though this formula doesnt always produce a prime, it still produces a lot of primes. Its known
that for n  10000000, there are 47,5% of primes produced by the formula!

So, youll write a program that will output how many primes does the formula output for a certain
interval.
```

## Output

```text
Each line of input will be given two positive integer a and b such that 0  a  b  10000. You must
read until the end of the file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each pair a, b read, you must output the percentage of prime numbers produced by the formula in
this interval (a  n  b) rounded to two decimal digits.

```

## Sample Output

```text
0 39
0 40
39 40

```
