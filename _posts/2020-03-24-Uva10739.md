title: Uva 10739  String to Palindrome
---


## Input

```text
In this problem you are asked to convert a string into a palindrome with minimum number of operations.
The operations are described below:

Here youd have the ultimate freedom. You are allowed to:

 Add any character at any position

 Remove any character from any position

 Replace any character at any position with another character

Every operation you do on the string would count for a unit cost. Youd have to keep that as low
as possible.

For example, to convert abccda you would need at least two operations if we allowed you only to
add characters. But when you have the option to replace any character you can do it with only one
operation. We hope youd be able to use this feature to your advantage.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases. The first line of the input gives you the number of test cases,
T (1  T  10). Then T test cases will follow, each in one line. The input for each test case consists
of a string containing lower case letters only. You can safely assume that the length of this string will
not exceed 1000 characters.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input print the test case number first. Then print the minimum number of characters
needed to turn the given string into a palindrome.

```

## Sample Output

```text
6
