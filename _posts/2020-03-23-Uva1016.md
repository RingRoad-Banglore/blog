1016 Silly Sort
Your younger brother has an assignment and needs some help. His teacher gave him a sequence of
numbers to be sorted in ascending order. During the sorting process, the places of two numbers can be
interchanged. Each interchange has a cost, which is the sum of the two numbers involved.

You must write a program that determines the minimal cost to sort the sequence of numbers.

## Input
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains
a single integer n (n > 1), representing the number of items to be sorted. The second line contains n
different integers (each positive and less than 1000), which are the numbers to be sorted.

The input is terminated by a zero on a line by itself.

## Output
For each test case, the output is a single line containing the test case number and the minimal cost of
sorting the numbers in the test case.

Place a blank line after the output of each test case

## Sample Input
<p>3</p><p>3 2 1</p><p>4</p><p>8 1 2 4</p><p>5</p><p>1 8 9 7 6</p><p>6</p><p>8 4 5 3 2 7</p><p>0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>Case 1: 4</p><p></p><p>Case 2: 17</p><p></p><p>Case 3: 41</p><p></p><p>Case 4: 34</p>
