```
Deal or No Deal is a TV game show that originated in Holland, but now is broadcasted in many
countries over the world. It has some variants in the number of prizes, the number of rounds and the
amounts of money that can be won. Here we will study a typical format.

Initially 15 candidates recieve a numbered box (number 1 trough 15) with in it each a cheque for an
amount of money between 10 and 500,000 Euro. The boxes are closed and the different amounts were
assigned randomly to the 15 boxes beforehand, so the candidates dont know which amount is in which
box. The game starts when one candidate is selected to play the game. He takes his box center-stage
and then plays upto 4 rounds.

In the first round, the candidate calls out 4 of the 14 remaining numbers (not his own) and these
boxes are opened and the enclosed amounts are displayed. Now it is sure the candidates box contains
one of the remaining 11 amounts, but not which. Based on the remaining amounts, the candidate is
offered a deal: he can leave the show with a certain amount of money (the deal), or continue playing (no
deal). If he decides to continue playing, in the second round he has to appoint 3 more of the remaining
boxes (not his own), which are then opened and the enclosed amounts are shown. Then again a deal
is offered based on the undisclosed amounts, which the candidate can take or leave. In each of the
remaining two rounds (if played), three more boxes are opened and a deal is offered. If the candidate
refuses the final deal when only two boxes are left, one of which is his own box, he has to open his box
and the enclosed amount is his.

The fifteen amounts in the boxes are: 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000,
50000, 100000, 200000 and 500000 Euro. The deal the candidate is offered in each round is a percentage
of the average of the remaining amounts. In the first round this percentage is low to tease the candidate
to continue playing, but during the following rounds the percentage steadily increases. Although the
actual percentages are unknown to the public, statistical analysis of previous game shows reveal that
they lie around the same values between shows. Lets take the following values as an example: 10%,
20%, 40% and 80% for rounds 1 to 4 respectively. To calculate the deals, we break off remainders after
division, so if in some round n boxes remain with a total amount of S and the percentage is p, then the
offer is the integer part of (S  p)/(100  n).

Lets illustrate a typical game, where the candidate refuses all deals. It is depicted in the following
table:

Amounts in
Round Boxes Selected Boxes Remaining Amounts Percentage Deal
1 4 200, 5000, 20000, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 10 7397

50000 10000, 100000, 200000, 500000
2 3 10, 50, 2000 20, 100, 500, 1000, 10000, 100000, 20 20278

200000, 500000
3 3 1000, 200000, 20, 100, 500, 10000, 100000 40 8849

500000
4 3 20, 10000, 100000 100, 500 80 240

So the candidate wins either 100 or 500 Euro, with equal chance, while at some point in the game
he could have walked away with about 20,000 Euro. Notice however that at that point he had a fair
chance of winning a (much) higher amount of money, but eventually the luck was against him.

The Problem

As you see, the spread of amounts a candidate can win is enormous, and during the game he has
to make several hazardous decisions. This makes the game attractive to a lot of people, both to play
and to watch. And guess what: someone you know has been selected to play in the show! Because
shes a clever girl, she wants to play using the following strategy: before the show she selects a certain
limiting amount of money; whenever, during the show, she is offered that amount or a higher one,
shell take that deal. If all offers are lower, she will play to the end. Because she is clever, but a bad
statician, she asks your advise. Given a certain limiting amount she wants you to calculate two values:
the probability that she will win at least this amount of money, and the expected amount she will win
when she follows her strategy with this limit. As you know, the expected outcome of an event is the
sum, over all possible events, of the products of outcome and probability for that particular event.

## Input

```
Several cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains one integer between 10 and 500000
(inclusive), a limiting amount in Euros for the strategy described. The second line contains 4 integers
between 1 and 200 (inclusive), the percentages for rounds 1 to 4 respectively. A line containing a zero
terminates the input and should not be processed.

## Output

```
Two numbers per case, separated by one space, on a line by itself, denoting the probability (between
0.0 and 1.0) and the average amount won (in Euros). A special corrector will tolerate an absolute error
of 106 and 102 for the two values respectively.

Epilogue (not needed to solve the problem)
The game Deal or No Deal was originally invented by EndemolProductions as part of a bigger game

show Miljoenenjacht (Hunt for the Millions). In this original format the game was played with 26
suitcases and prizes ranging from 0.01 to 5,000,000 Euro. Now the show airs in more than 30 countries
and has its own page in Wikipedia.

Scientifically the show is interesting to social scientists and economists, because it gives an op-
portunity to study human behaviour under rapidly changing gain/loss situations. Deal or No
Deal?Decision Making Under Risk in a Large-payoff Game Show (Post et.al. 2006)
is one such study, that concludes that people are more willing to cut a reasonable deal after they have
sustained a big loss. In the example given in the problem statement, most people would accept the deal
in round 3 after loosing two major opportunities, even though the expected earning when continuing
is more than double the amount of the deal. At the same time, most people would reject the much
higher deal in round 2, because the perspectives of winning even higher amounts are still reasonable.
Our clever friend in the problem statement would have won at least her limit of 20,000 Euros in about
two-thirds of the cases. The situation in the game show is not much different from real life (Stock
Exchange, Job Market, Real Estate, etc.), although maybe a bit more extreme. Endemol likes to put
people under extreme circumstances; they also created Big Brother and Fear Factor.
