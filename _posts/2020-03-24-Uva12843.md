The miners and their claims

Our puzzle shows an animated dispute between some miners
over their respective claims. It seems that they have obtained
patents on some mining claims of the same size. Each claim
was in the form of a right angled triangle, and all of exactly
the same area, but of diferent dimensions, as would be the case
with a triangle with a base of 35 feet, an elevation of 12 and the
hypotenuse of 37, as compared with another with dimensions
of 20, 21 and 29, as both contain areas of 210 feet. The puzzle
calls for the complete list of diferent triangles with an area
of 210 square feet, taking into account that all triangles must
have a square angle, and the lengths of their sides must be
integers.

Your task now is to identify all possible triangles (right-angled and with sides of integer lengths,
as in the puzzle) with a certain area A. Print the lengths of each triangle in ascending order, and the
whole list of triangles in ascending order as wellsort the triangles frst by their frst (shortest) side,
then the second side and fnally by their longest side.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases. Each test is described by
a single integer A, in a line of its own.

T  104; 1  A  107

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the number of valid triangles with area A. Then
print the sorted list of these triangles, one per line, using the format (a, b, c), where a, b, c are the
lengths of the sides of the triangle, in ascending order.
