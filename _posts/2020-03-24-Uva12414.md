```
Yuanfen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuanfen) is a Chinese term that is hard to understand for
people in other countries. Roughly speaking, yuanfen means the pre-determined binding force that
links two people (usually two lovers) together. Although it is a blind faith, many people, especially
girls like to calculate it.

Unfortunately, my girlfriend is one of them. One day, she asked me, Sweetie, shall we find out our
yuanfen? Oh, I really hate that question, but I cannot reject it... Luckily, Im a programmer, so the
only thing I need to do is to find a seemingly good algorithm and write a yuanfen calculator. After
several hours searching in the web, I decided to implement the following popular yuanfen algorithm:

Step 1: Pick up the name abbreviations of the couple and concatenate them. For example, if the couple
named Jiang Yun Fan and Tang Yu Rou, the concatenation of abbreviations is JYFTYR.

Step 2: Replace each letter with a number string. For some predefined positive integer ST , replace A with
ST , and B with ST +1, C with ST +2, , Z with ST +25. For example, if ST = 81, A should be
replaced with 81, B should be replaced with 82, , Z will be replaced by 106. In the case above,
JYFTYR will be replaced by 901058610010598.

Step 3: Repeat the following: add up each pair of consecutive digits, and write down the last digit of
each sum. Its not difficult to see that each time we perform this action, the number of digits is
decreased by 1. When the number string is exactly 100, or has no more than 2 digits, the process
ends. The current number is the yuanfen between the couple. In the case above, the process is
as follows:

901058610010598
91153471011547
0268718112691
284589923850
02937815135
2120596648
332545202
65799722
1268694
384453
12898
3077
374
01

So if ST = 81, Jiang Yun Fan and Tang Yu Rous yuanfen is only 1!
Too bad! I know my girlfriend very well. I know that even the result is as high as 99, shell still be

unhappy. Could you find the value of ST such that the yuanfen between my sweetheart and I is 100?

## Input

```
There will be at most 50 test cases. Each case contains a string of at least four and at most ten capital
letters.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the smallest positive integer ST (note that ST should not be zero). If it does
not exist or larger than 10000, print a string :( (without quotes).

Disclaimer
Dont be sad if the result of you and your sweetie is larger than 10000. Thats no big deal.
