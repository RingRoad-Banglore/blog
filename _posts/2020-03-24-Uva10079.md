title: Uva 10079  Pizza Cutting
---


## Input

```text
When someone calls Ivan lazy, he claims that it is his intelligence that helps him to be so. If his
intelligence allows him to do something at less physical effort, why should he exert more? He also
claims that he always uses his brain and tries to do some work at less effort; this is not his laziness,
rather this is his intellectual smartness.

Once Ivan was asked to cut a pizza into seven pieces to distribute it among
his friends. (Size of the pieces may not be the same. In fact, his piece will be
larger than the others.) He thought a bit, and came to the conclusion that
he can cut it into seven pieces by only three straight cuts through the pizza
with a pizza knife. Accordingly, he cut the pizza in the following way (guess
which one is Ivans piece):

One of his friends, who never believed in Ivans smartness, was startled
at this intelligence. He thought, if Ivan can do it, why cant my computer?
So he tried to do a similar (but not exactly as Ivans, for Ivan will criticize
him for stealing his idea) job with his computer. He wrote a program that
took the number of straight cuts one makes through the pizza, and output a number representing the
maximum number of pizza pieces it will produce.

Your job here is to write a similar program. It is ensured that Ivans friend wont criticize you for
doing the same job he did.
```

## Output
