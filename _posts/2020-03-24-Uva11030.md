title: Uva 11030  Predator II

## Input

```text
Oh No!!! The predator has entered the room again. But this time it is a different kind of room.

The room is a square of size 10000  10000. There are several compartments of different shapes
and sizes, situated strictly inside the room. The walls of different compartments dont overlap, but a
compartment can be completely inside that of another.

This time the predator has learned to hop over walls, but it can jump over at most one wall at a
time. Given the starting and ending coordinates of the predator, and the positions of the compartments,
your job is to find out the minimum number of hops required for the predator to reach his destination
from the start.

The starting and ending positions are never on the boundary of any compartment.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input is an integer (T  20), that indicates the number of test cases. Each case starts
with an integer (n  20), that determines the number of compartments in the room. The next n lines
give the positions of the compartments. The compartments are simple polygons. The description of
each compartment starts with an integers (S  10), that gives the number of sides of the polygon,
followed by S pairs of x, y coordinates in order. Next there is an integer Q that determines the number
of queries for this scenario. Each of the next Q lines contains 4 integers x1, y1, x2, y2. (x1, y1) is the
starting position and (x2, y2) is the ending position.

The lower left and upper right coordinates of the room are (0, 0) and (10000, 10000) respectively.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output the case number. Then for each query, output the minimum number of hops
required.

Illustration: The following diagram depicts the first
sample input.

 Pink spot a starting position

 Black spot a target

 The three hops are shown by three broad line
segments.
