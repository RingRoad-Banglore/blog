## Input

```

Now Coach Pang is preparing for the Graduate Record Examinations as George did in 2011. At each
day, Coach Pang can:

 +w: learn a word w

 ?p: read a paragraph p, and count the number of learnt words. Formally speaking, count the
number of substrings of p which is a learnt words.

Given the records of N days, help Coach Pang to find the count. For convenience, the characters
occured in the words and paragraphs are only 0 and 1.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer T , which denotes the number of test cases. T test
cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N (1  N  105), which is the number of days.
Each of the following N lines contains either +w or ?p. Both p and w are 01-string in this problem.

Note that the input file has been encrypted. For each string occured, let L be the result of last ?
operation. The string given to you has been shifted L times (the shifted version of string s1s2 . . . sk is
sks1s2 . . . sk1). You should decrypt the string to the original one before you process it. Note that L
equals to 0 at the beginning of each test case.

The test data guarantees that for each test case, total length of the words does not exceed 105 and
total length of the paragraphs does not exceed 5  106.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, first output a line Case #x:, where x is the case number (starting from 1). And
for each ? operation, output a line containing the result.
