title: Uva 11381  Elegant Strings
---


## Input

```text
A subsequence of a string T = t0t1t2 . . . tn1 is T  = ti0ti1 . . . tim where i0 < i1 < . . . im and m < n.

A substring of a string is a subsequence of the string where every element is consecutive.

You will be given a string S. P is the set of all the distinct substrings of S of length 2. Now
the elegancy of each element of P is the square of the index (1-based) in S of the first letter of that
substring. If a substring occurs multiple times only the first occurrence should be considered for the
elegancy. Suppose, S = abcabd. This means P is consisted of the substrings ab, bc, ca and bd. And
the elegancies of those substrings are 1, 4, 9 and 25 respectively.

Now you will be given another string T . You have to split T to minimum amount of strings such that
every string is a subsequence of T , any of the strings should not contain any substrings of length 2
which dont belong to P . Every character of T should belong to exactly one string. If multiple ways to
divide T to minimum amount of strings, you have to consider that which minimizes the total elegancy
of all the strings. Elegancy of a string is the sum of elegancy of all the length 2 substrings of that string.
For a one letter string the elegancy is 0. Total elegancy is the sum of elegancy of all the strings.

Lets say, S = abcabd and T = bcadzb. One of the valid ways to split T is: {bc,ab, d, z}. Note
that {acb, d, z, b} is not a valid way because acb is not a subsequence in T . Also {cab, bdz} is not a
valid way either because the string bdz contains dz which dont belong to P although all the elements
are subsequences. Now the optimal subsequences for this are {bcab, z, d} which has total elegancy of
(14 + 0 + 0) = 14. For this case you cant split T to less than 3 subsequences and with 3 subsequences
it is the minimal total elegancy.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains a number X, the number of test cases which is at most 20. Each case
starts with S. The next line contains T . Both S, T contains only lowercase letters. S consists of at
most 1000 characters and T consists of at most 100 characters. There wont be any blank lines between
two lines.

```

## Sample Input

```text
You have to output two numbers K and C separated by a space where K is the minimum amount of
strings possible by splitting T according to the above rules and C is the minimum total elegancy.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1
abcabd
bcadzb

```
