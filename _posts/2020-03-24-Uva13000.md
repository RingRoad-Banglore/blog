title: Uva 13000  VIP Treatment
---


```
For any government project, VIPs are always a problem. You cant expect a high profile VIP person to
wait for a month for some job to be done like a normal people. This is a big problem for government
software projects as you have to create alternate ways to bypass business logic and finish some job
early. Now you are working on some government software project and you have to manage some job
requests, processing and management as well as have to do VIP treatment. In this problem we will
solve a sub-problem of it, assigning the jobs to worker.

For the software there are M kinds of jobs, numbered from 1 to M and N workers numbered from
1 to N . As the jobs are mostly similar, so the time needed for a particular worker to do any kind of job
request is same. Different worker may need different amount of time. Now for each j-th (1  j  M)
kind of job, your software have to consider 3 things,

 Number of VIP requests vj for this kind of job.

 Number of regular requests rj for this kind of job.

 A non-empty list of workers wrj who can do this kind of job.

All the VIP job request have to be processed. But the management also wants to process at least
K (0  K 

M
j=1)rj) total regular job requests.

The software have to assign this requests to workers and have to do it in a way that total time
needed is minimized. Now a worker numbered i (1  i  N) can complete any kind of job request
in Wi time but cant do more than one job at a time. After the requested job is finished, he can do
another job again, which will cost him another Wi time. So if any worker numbered i does total Ti
jobs, it would take him Ti Wi time to finish.

The total time needed to finish the project is the maximum time needed by any worker (Maximum
Ti Wi for all i such that 1  i  N). Your job for this problem is to make such an arrangement that
the total time needed is minimized.

## Input

```
The first line of input contains a positive integer number TC (TC  200), number of test case. Then
TC test cases follow.

There will be blank line before each test case.
First line of each test case will contain three space separated integers M (1  M  50), N (1 

N  50) and K. Next line will contain N space separated integer numbers, i-th of those numbers will
be Wi, time needed by worker i to do a single job (1  Wi  100). Each of the next M lines contains
description of a job, where the first three integers of the j-th line are vj (0  vj  1, 000, 000) number
of VIP job requests of kind j, rj (0  rj  1, 000, 000) number of regular job requests of kind j and nj
(1  nj  N) number of workers who can do j-th kind of job. Then nj integers follow. The k-th of the
next nj integers is wrjk (1  wrjk  N), means worker numbered wrjk can do j-th kind of job.

```

## Output

```
For each test case print a line in Case I: T  format where I is the case number and T is the minimum
time required for doing all VIP requests and at least K regular job requests.
Note: Explanation for Sample Case

In the first case, there are 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 regular job requests and 10 VIP job requests. Also for
each type of job, only one worker can do it. So



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 13000  VIP Treatment 2/2

 The 1st worker get 2 + 3 = 5 jobs and with 2 unit time per job he needs 5  2 = 10 unit of time.

 The 2nd worker get 2 + 3 = 5 jobs and with 4 unit time per job he needs 5  4 = 20 unit of time.

 The 3rd worker get 2 + 4 = 6 jobs and with 8 unit time per job he needs 6  8 = 48 unit of time.

As they all can work independently, total time needed is 48.
In the second case, there in only one worker and he got total 2 + 3 = 5 VIP job requests and 4

regular job requests. So He need (5 + 4)  2 = 18 unit of time.
In the third case, worker 1 will do 6 jobs with 6  1 = 6 unit of time and worker 2 will do 3 jobs

with 3  2 = 6 unit of time. So to do 9 jobs, total time needed is 6.
