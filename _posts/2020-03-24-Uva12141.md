```
ACRush is very famous in Supercoder. Supercoder is a professional company which arranges online
algorithmic contests and rates peoples based on those contests. In Supercoder algorithm contest ranklist,
ACRush is ranked third. Now a days he is doing some analysis on his rating history in Supercoder
algorithm contest. In Supercoder, an algorithm contest is termed as a Single Round Tournament (SRT).
After each SRT is finished, rating of a contestant is updated according to his/her relative performance.
ACRush collected all these rating information, and using those he created a line chart.

To make things more clear, let us consider the following table as his rating info.

SRT Rating
320 3
306 1
401 3
325 4
393 5
380 2

From this table, we see that his first SRT was SRT#306, and rating after that SRT was 1, so he
marked point (1, 1) as r1 in graph paper, his second SRT was SRT#320 and rating after that SRT

was 3, so he marked (2, 3) as r2, then he add r1 with r2 by a straight line and so on.
In general for his i-th SRT he marked point (i, rating after i-th SRT) by ri.
After marking all the points he will add point ri with ri1 by straight lines, for all 1 < i  N ,

Where N is the total number of SRTs he played. For better idea look at figure 1:

Fig 1: Line chart cosidering all SRTs Fig 2: Line chart ignoring SRT #380

After drawing line chart, he became very interested about the number of peaks. There are two kinds
of peaks in a line chart, 1) Upper Peak and 2) Lower Peak. Upper Peak is that point in a line chart
whose previous and next point has smaller y coordinates and lower peak is that points in a line chart
whose previous and next point has greater y coordinates. For example total number of peak in figure
1 is 3. Two of them upper peak, which are (3, 4) and (5, 5), and one of them is lower peak which is (4,
2).

ACRush observed that by ignoring SRT#380, his line chart will become like figure 2, in which
number of peak is only 1. By observing this he became more curious. Now he wants to know, by

ignoring 0 or more SRTs how many distinct line charts having K peaks is possible. ACRush calls these
line charts K-peak Line charts, in a K-peak line chart he doesnt allow two consecutive points to have
same y coordinate.

## Input

```
Input will start with an integer T (T  12), which indicates the number of test cases. Each case starts
with a line having two integers N (1  N  10000) and K (0  K  50). Each of the next N lines will
contain two integers SRT (1  SRT  1000000000) and Rating (1  Rating  1000000000). All the
SRT numbers will be distinct.

```

## Output

```
For Each test case output a single Line Case #: W , here # will be replaced by case number and W
will be replaced by the number of distinct K-peak line charts modulo 1000000.

```
