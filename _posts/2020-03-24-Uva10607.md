```
The kingdom of Flatland can be represented as a rectangle M  N , which consists of squares 1  1.
Flatland is divided into K provinces (2 < K < 100). Each province is a connected set of squares i.e.
its possible to get from one point of a province to another one. However, its allowed to move from
square to square if and only if two squares have the same side (having the same vertex is not enough).
There is no point in Flatland, which has a boundary with more than three other provinces i.e. four
squares, which have the same vertex cant belong to four different provinces.

Each province has its own symbol. The capital of Flatland is situated in the province marked as A
(capital Latin A). A province is called a frontier if it contains frontier squares. The capital of Flatland
is not frontier.

An evil king from the kingdom of Wreckland wants to conquer Flatland. In order to do that he
wants, he has to conquer the capital of Flatland. But he knows that his army has not been strong
enough to do it at once, capturing all the provinces. So, the evil king decided to surround the capital,
to weaken the forces of Flatland by long siege, and then conquer the capital.

In order to surround the capital, he should conquer all boundary provinces of it. Two provinces are
bordering on each other if there are two squares, which have the same side, one of which belongs to one
province, and the other one belongs to the other one. In order to conquer a province, the king should
do one of these statements: either it is a frontier province or it is an already conquered province.

In order to save his forces (its the most important issue on a war!), the king of Wreckland wants
to conquer as fewer provinces as he can. Please help him to find out how many provinces he should
conquer. The king realizes that he cant conquer the capital right now, because his army has not been
strong enough

## Input

```
There can be multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains M and N (3 < M,N < 200).
Next M lines contain N symbols each and give the map of Flatland. The character in i+ 1-th line in
j-th place, represent the square in (i, j). All the symbols have ASCII-code higher than 32(blank). The
input ends with a case where M = 0 and N = 0. You must not process this test case.

```

## Output

```
The only one line of the output contains the only one number  the number of provinces which must
be conquered. If it is impossible to conquer the capital, then print -1.
