title: Uva 12029  Flying Spaceships
---


## Input

```
There is a war going on in space. Being a pilot, you need to fly a spaceship in the 3D environment.
What makes it more interesting is that there is no predefined Up or Down direction, due to lack
of gravity. One day, you are given a task of observing some object P. You start from a position S. You
then visit various positions. Normally your spaceship travels in a straight line. It can stay stationary
as well. You finish your journey by reaching the point D. In the whole path you keep observing P.

Now, your superior officer wants to know the following information: During your travel (i.e. any
point on the path from S to D), what was the minimum and maximum distances from the object
P to your spaceship? Very easy task! You just need to look-up the coordinates you have been!
Unfortunately, your tracking system got jammed. It could not track the coordinates. But dont be
so disheartened. It did record control commands for the spaceship.

You can rotate your spaceship in three different axes (remember, 3D right?). Refer to that of
the movement of a F16 airplane in the figure. You have three kinds of rotations, namely: Pitching,
Yawing, and Rolling. These rotations change the directions of the front nose (i.e. moving direction).
Additionally, your spaceship can move forward along in the direction of its nose. Of course, argument
for this movements and rotations will be given, in kilometers (km) and degrees respectively. There
will four kinds of commands in general:

Command Remarks
FORWARD< space >< DIST > 0 < DIST  1000

PITCH< space >< DEG > 180  DEG  180
YAW< space >< DEG > 180  DEG  180
ROLL< space >< DEG > 180  DEG  180

When viewing your spaceship from outside, 6 rotations can be possible based on the sign of DEG.

Left View from outside Top View from outside Back View from outside
PITCH +ve Pitch up YAW +ve Yaw right ROLL +ve Roll right
PITCH ve Pitch down YAW ve Yaw left ROLL ve Roll left

The 3D space is modeled by coordinates (x, y, z) each represented in kilometers. So, S and P are
given by (Sx, Sy, Sz) and (Px, Py, Pz) respectively. The spaceship initially is at position S facing the
Positive X-axis direction (1, 0, 0), and its Up direction is the Positive Z-axis direction (0, 0, 1)
(Dont confuse this Up direction with Up direction of the environment!). Consider this example:
S = (10, 10, 10). You traveled 30 km from S. Then, you pitched up by 90 degrees, and then went for
another 10 km. After that you rolled left for 90 degrees, and went for 30 km.

No. Command Spaceship Location Direction of Moving Up Direction
Initial Configuration > > > (10, 10, 10) (1, 0, 0) (0, 0, 1)

1 FORWARD 30 (40, 10, 10) (1, 0, 0) (0, 0, 1)
2 PITCH 90 (40, 10, 10) (0, 0, 1) (-1, 0, 0)
3 FORWARD 10 (40, 10, 20) (0, 0, 1) (-1, 0, 0)
4 ROLL -90 (40, 10, 20) (0, 0, 1) (0, 1, 0)
5 FORWARD 30 (40, 10, 50) (0, 0, 1) (0, 1, 0)

Given N commands from the starting position S sequentially, you need to find the minimum and
maximum distances of the object P from your path of travel.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing seven integers in the following order: N (0  N  1000),
Sx, Sy, Sz, Px, Py, Pz. Each of the next N lines contains a command (listed above). The commands
are given in sequential order. Magnitude of each of the input values will be less or equal to 1000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number, the minimum and then the maximum distance (both in km).

Absolute errors less than 106 will be tolerated. The minimum distance will not be less than 0.5
km.

```

## Sample Output

```

FORWARD 30
PITCH 90
FORWARD 10
ROLL -90
FORWARD 30
