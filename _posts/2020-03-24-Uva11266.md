## Input

```
Find the number of solutions, the equation


Xi = s have, if Ai  Xi  Bi for each i = 1 . . . n.

For example:
X1 +X2 +X3 = 10
1  X1  3
2  X2  4
6  X3  7

The above set of equations has 6 solutions. They are: {1,4,7}, {0,3,7}, {0,4,6}, {1,2,7}, {1,3,6} and
{2,2,6}.

You are given n the number of variables and the range of them. Your task is to calculate the number
of solutions of that equation.
```

## Output

```
First line of the Input contains T ( 50) the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of
each test case contains 2 integer n (1  n  10) and s (50000  s  50000). Next n lines each contain
2 integers describing the range of each variable. The i-th line Ai and Bi (10000  Ai  Bi  10000).
Xi can take any integral value in the range [Ai, Bi].

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output contains one integer denoting the number of solutions of the given equations.
Output the value modulo 200003.

```

## Sample Output

```
1
3 10
-1 3
2 4
6 7
