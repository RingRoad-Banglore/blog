title: Uva 10877  Diceoids
---


## Input

```
The following picture shows four dice. Or are they all dice?

Artifacts (a) and (b) are dice; (c) and (d) are not dice, but
they are the same  you can see that by a suitable rotation of (d).
Thus, here we have two classes of dice-like artifacts (diceoids),
classified by comparison under suitable rotations.

You are given a bag of diceoids, and your job is to classify
them and report how many classes there are. (Your job is not
to determine how many are dice.) To facilitate description of
diceoids in a text medium, we label the faces of the cube:

then a diceoid is encoded as a sequence of six numbers dA, ,
dF , meaning that face i bears di dots.

Example: 5 3 6 2 1 4 means that face A has 5 dots, face B has 3 dots, face C has 6 dots, etc. It is
entirely possible that different faces have the same number of dots, e.g., 2 2 2 3 3 3, but every face has
at least 1 dot and at most 6 dots.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases. The description of each test case is given below:

Each test case begins with the number of diceoids n (n  1000), followed by the description of n
dicecoids.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case your program should output the number of classes. Follow the format specified in
the output for sample input.
