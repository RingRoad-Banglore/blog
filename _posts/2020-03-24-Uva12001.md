---


## Input

```text
The UVa online judge team is arranging a panel discussion for the next ACM-ICPC World Finals event
in Orlando, Florida. They want that three or four of the contestants take part in the panel and as they
have about 300 persons for selecting such a little group, they have decided to put some restrictions in
order to reduce the number of possibilities.

After thinking about several options, they finally propose that in case the number of contestants to
choice be 3, all of them must be of the same country or from three different countries; and in case the
number be 4, at least three of them will be of the same country or must be from at least three different
countries.

Could you help them to calculate the number of different selections they can make following the
restrictions above.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases; each of them consists of two lines.

The first contains two integers N and M separated by one space. N (3  N  300) is the number
of contestants and M (1  M  50) the total number of different countries. The second line consists
of N integers between 1 and M , separated by a space, representing the country each contestant is from
(It is not necessary that contestants will be from M countries).

Last line of the input will contain two zeroes and it wont be processed.
