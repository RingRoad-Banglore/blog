title: Uva 10939  Ants Aphids and a Ladybug
---


## Input

```
If you are searching for ladybugs, the best place to
look is near ants. The ants suck sweet honeydew from
aphids and therefore, where there are ants, there must
be aphids. Where there are aphids, there are more
likely to be ladybugs. Ants defend aphids against
ladybugs  for which aphids are a much sought for
delicacy.

An old tree near the anthill serves as an aphid
farm. On the old tree, branches connect the forks
(spaces where two or more branches meet) and leaves
where the aphids feed. There are k ant-guards (num-
bered from 1 to k) working on the farm. A ladybug
hunting aphids lands on the places where aphids feed,
i.e. on leaves or forks. When a ladybug lands on the
tree, the guard-ants set off in her direction in order
to chase her away. They comply with the following
rules:

 There is exactly one way for an ant to go from one fork or leaf in the tree to another fork or
leaf without ever turning back. Upon the ladybugs landing, all of the ant-guards simultaneously
start going along such a route to the place where the ladybug landed.

 If there is an ant in the place of the ladybugs landing, the ladybug takes off immediately.

 If at any time an ant rushing towards the ladybug spots another ant anywhere ahead on its route,
the ant stops and remains in its current position, yielding to the ant that is farther ahead.

 If two or more ants try to reach the same fork of the tree at the same time, only one does so  the
one with the smallest id number. The other ants trying to reach the same fork remain in their
places.

 An ant which gets to the place of ladybugs landing chases it away and remains in this place.

The ladybug is stubborn and lands on the tree again, and then the ant-guards set off again trying
to chase the intruder away. In order to simplify the problem we assume that for each ant it takes a unit
of time to walk between two neighboring forks or a fork and a leaf (2 leaves cannot be neighbors).
```

## Output

```
The input file contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n, the number of leaves
and forks in the tree, 1  n  5000. We assume that leaves and forks are numbered from 1 to n. Each
of the following n  1 lines describes tree branches; each branch is described by two integers a and b,
meaning that the branch connects forks or leaves labeled a and b. In the (n + 1)-st line there is one
integer k, 1  k  1000 and k  n; k is the number of ants that guard the tree. There is one positive
integer (not greater than n) in each of the following k lines. The integer written in the (n + 1 + i)-th
line is the start position of the i-th ant. There is no fork or leaf in the tree occupied by more than
one ant. The line n + k + 2 contains one integer l, 1  l  500, l saying how many times a ladybug

lands on the tree. Each of the following l lines contains one positive integer (not greater than n). These
numbers define a sequence of tree places in which the ladybug lands. Input is terminated by the case
with n equal to 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
Your program should output k lines for each test case. In the i-th line for a case there should be two
integers separated by a single space  the final position of the i-th ant (number of a fork or a leaf) and
the number of times the i-th ant chased the ladybug away.
