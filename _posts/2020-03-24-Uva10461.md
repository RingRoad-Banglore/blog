title: Uva 10461  Difference
---


## Input

```text
You are given a list of jobs with associated time to complete them. Also are given a list of job
dependencies. Your job is to calculate the maximum possible difference among all possible completion
time of a particular job. For this problem, job dependency is a bit simpler. When a job depends on
several other jobs to be completed, finishing of all of them will allow it to execute. Furthermore, jobs
cannot be executed in parallel and there will be no idle moment.

In the above example job-B cannot be started before A and D. So it can be started after 5 days and
it must be started after 7 days. Here for job-B, the difference is 2 days.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with a pair of integers v (1  v  500) and e (0  e  500) where v represents the number
of jobs and e represents the number of dependencies in the dependency list. Following is a line with
v integers each indicating the time in days to complete the jobs where the ith integer denotes the
completion time of the ith job. The jobs are numbered by integers from 1 to v. Next e lines has the
form x y which means that job x should be completed prior to job y (1  x, y  v). Next line has an
integer q which denotes the number of queries to answer which is followed by q integers x (1  x  v).
A line with v = e = 0 ends the input session. Every block will be followed by a blank line.

There will be no impractical situation (each job can be completed) in input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query in a block output the result according to the problem description in a separate line. A
blank line is essential after every block of data. See the sample output.

```
