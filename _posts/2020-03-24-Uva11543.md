title: Uva 11543  Two Points and Curious MumboJumbo
---


## Input

```

Given two points a and b on a two dimensional plane, a curious mind can play many curious games.
One such curious game would be to draw two pairs of parallel lines through these points, the first pair
being inclined at and angle of 1 and the second pair being inclined at an angle of 2 with ab, resulting
in a parallelogram. Let the other two points on the parallelogram be c and d such that c is the one lying
on left hand side when looking at b from a. So now we have the parallelogram acbd having diagonals
ab and cd. Now the mathematical mind sees that it has discovered an interesting way of constructing
parallelograms from a pair of points and decides to name this operation mumbo and happily defines a
notation for this operation mumbo(a, b).

Note that the parallelograms produces by mumbo(a, b) and mumbo(b, a) for any two points on the
plane have same shape but different orientation.

To take the game a little farther, the mathematical mind divides the diagonal ab into three equal
parts ae, ef and fb. Joining e with c and f with d produces a strange picture that farther increases
the curiosity of the mathematical mind. To satisfy its curiosity the mind decides to apply the operation
mumbo on these 5 line segment. The result after applying mumbo(a, e), mumbo(e, f), mumbo(f, b),
mumbo(e, c) and mumbo(f, d) is an even strange picture showing five smaller parallelograms inside the
initial larger parallelogram. All six of the parallelograms have similar shape but some has different
orientation and they have same size except for the initial one which in fact contains all the other
parallelograms inside itself.

Happily, the mind names this operation of producing smaller parallelograms of same shape jumbo.
The notation for this operation is jumbo(a, d, b, c) where a, d, b and c are the vertices of the parallelogram
in counter clockwise order.

The mind takes the game even farther by recursive mumbo jumbo many times, resulting in a very
strange picture consisting of parallelograms of same shape but different sizes and orientations. Now,
to satisfy the ultimate curiosity, for any two points P1 and P2 on the plane, the mind wants to know
the area of the smallest parallelogram not containing any other parallelogram that contains both of
these points. To keep things simple, mind has decided that 1 should be the angle  cab and always be
tan1(1) and 2 should be the angle  abd and always be tan

1(1/2).

## Output

```
There will be multiple test cases, each on a seperate line. Each line will contain eight floating point
numbers Xa, Ya, Xb, Yb, XP1 , YP1 , XP2 , YP2 denoting coordinates of a, b, P1 and P2 respcetively. Here
a and b are the points to start mumbo jumbo with. You can assume that P1 and P2 will be distinct
and at least 106 units apart.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input, your program should produce a line of output consisting of a single floating point
number having four digits after decimal point denoting the area of the smallest parallelogram produced
by mumbo jumbo which contains both P1 and P2 but does not contain any other parallelogram that
contain both of these points. If either or both of the points are outside of the parallelogram, then print
-1 as output. If a point lies exactly on a vertex of a parallelogram then the point is considered to be
inside the parallelogram.
