title: Uva 12312  Bounding Volume Hierarchy
---


## Input

```text
A bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) is a tree structure on a set of geometric objects. All geometric
objects are wrapped in bounding volumes that form the leaf nodes of the tree. These nodes are then
grouped as small sets and enclosed within larger bounding volumes. These, in turn, are also grouped
and enclosed within other larger bounding volumes in a recursive fashion, eventually resulting in a tree
structure with a single bounding volume at the top of the tree.

(An example of a bounding volume hierarchy using rectangles as bounding volumes)

BVH can be used as an accelerating structure in ray tracing algorithms. In this problem, youre to
implement a static BVH to answer ray-triangle intersection queries efficiently (by static we mean the
scene does not change). Note that if the ray hits more than one triangle, only the closest one is output.

For people who have no idea how the BVHs are constructed, here is a simple way: compute the
axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of all the objects, and then sort the objects by the coordinates of
the widest dimension. After that, build the left sub-tree with the first half of objects and the right
sub-tree with the remaining, recursively. Note that the AABBs of the objects in the left sub-tree and
the right sub-tree might be overlapping, so when traversing the BVH, you need to visit both sub-trees
if the ray intersects with the AABBs of both halves of objects. When the number objects is small, we
do not split them, so the node becomes a leaf of BVH.

The detail above is just one way of implementing BVH. Another way is to split a node with an
axis-aligned plane. Sorting is avoided (for each object, it takes constant time to determine which sub-
tree it should go to), but you may need to place a single object in both sub-trees. Feel free to employ
your own ideas in your program if you like. As long as your program is both correct and fast, it will be
accepted.

## Output

```text
There will be at most 10 test cases. Each case begins with an integers p (3  p  40, 000), the number
of vertices, Each of the next p lines contains 3 integers, the coordinates of each vertex. The next line
is an integer t (1  t  80, 000), the number of triangles. Each of the next t lines contains 3 integers,
the vertex indices of each triangle. Vertices and triangles are both numbered sequentially from 0.

The next line contains an integer q (1  q  10, 000), the number of queries. Each of the next q
lines contains 6 integers, the positions of origin and target of a ray. The origin is guaranteed to be
strictly outside any triangle. Note that were talking about rays, not segments, so target is actually
just a point that the ray passed through. The coordinates are real numbers with small absolute values.
The last test case is followed by a line with p = 0, which should not be processed.

The triangle meshes are extracted from real-world models.

## Sample Input

```text
For each ray, print the ID of the triangle that the ray is hit, and the position of the hit point. If nothing
is hit, print a single -1. Weve carefully designed the judge I/O, but to further reduce the impact of
floating-point errors, the percentage of incorrect output lines can be up to 5%, but please do not omit
or add any line, since the comparison is done sequentially.

```
