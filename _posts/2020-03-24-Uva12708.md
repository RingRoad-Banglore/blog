## Input

```

Given N , print the largest number that can be achieved by taking gcd (greatest common divisor) of
any two i and j where i = j and 1  i, j  N .
```

## Output

```
First line of input will contain the number of test cases, T  2000. Then T cases follow. For each case,
there is a line containing one integer N where 2  N  1018.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print one line containing a single integer which is the largest gcd of all pairs of numbers
between 1 to N .

Output Explanation
In the second case the GCD table is:

Here the largest gcd of all pairs of numbers between 1 to 5 is 2.

```

## Sample Output
