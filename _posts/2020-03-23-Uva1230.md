1230 MODEX

Many well-known cryptographic operations require modular exponentiation. That is, given integers x,
y and n, compute xy mod n. In this question, you are tasked to program an efficient way to execute
this calculation.

## Input

The input consists of a line containing the number c of datasets, followed by c datasets, followed by a
line containing the number ‘0’.

Each dataset consists of a single line containing three positive integers, x, y, and n, separated by
blanks. You can assume that 1 < x, n < 215 = 32768, and 0 < y < 231 = 2147483648.

## Output

The output consists of one line for each dataset. The i-th line contains a single positive integer z such
that

z = xy mod n

for the numbers x, y, z given in the i-th input dataset.
