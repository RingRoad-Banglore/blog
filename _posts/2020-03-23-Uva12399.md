12399 NumPuzz II
We consider again the iPhone game NumPuzz. Please refer to previous
problem: NumPuzz I for details of the game.

This task may be thought of as the opposite of previous problem.
Write a program that accepts as input an initial configuation of a game
instance, and returns a solution that takes the fewest clicks possible.

## Input
The input format here corresponds exactly to the output format of pre-
vious problem. The first line of each case gives the case number, and the
following three lines contains the matrix entries at the start of the game.

## Output
For each test case, output a string that describes an optimal solution to
the given puzzle. Use ‘a’ to represent the upper left corner, ‘b’ for the square to its right, etc. Print an
empty line if no clicks are required. If the puzzle is unsolvable, output ‘No solution.’ instead.

## Sample Input
<p>Case #1:</p><p>1 1 1</p><p>1 1 1</p><p>1 0 0</p><p>Case #2:</p><p>0 0 0</p><p>0 0 0</p><p>0 0 0</p><p>Case #3:</p><p>3 3 3</p><p>3 4 3</p><p>3 3 3</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>cd</p><p></p><p>cdifbgah</p>
