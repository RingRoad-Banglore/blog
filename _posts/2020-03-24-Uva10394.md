title: Uva 10394  Twin Primes
---


```
Twin primes are pairs of primes of the form (p, p+2). The term twin prime was coined by Paul Stckel
(1892-1919). The first few twin primes are (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43). In this
problem you are asked to find out the S-th twin prime pair where S is an integer that will be given in
the input.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain less than 10001 lines of input. Each line contains an integers S (1  S  100000),
which is the serial number of a twin prime pair. Input file is terminated by end of file.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input you will have to produce one line of output which contains the S-th twin prime
pair. The pair is printed in the form (p1,<space>p2). Here <space> means the space character (ASCII
32) . You can safely assume that the primes in the 100000-th twin prime pair are less than 20000000.

```

## Sample Input

```
1
2
3
4

```

## Sample Output

```
(3, 5)
(5, 7)
(11, 13)
(17, 19)
```
