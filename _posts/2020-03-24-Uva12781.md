title: Uva 12781  Alternation Formulae
---


```

For a positive integer n, let S(n) be the string defined by the concatenation of the decimal notations
(without leading zeroes!) of 1, 2, . . . , n. For instance, S(11) = 1234567891011.

An (arithmetic) formula F is an n-alternation if it is built inserting in the string S(n) arithmetic
operators +, - and parentheses (,). Besides of that, it is required that the used arithmetic operators
occur alternately in F .

An n-alternation, being an arithmetic formula, has an integer value. The following are two examples
of 11-alternations with the indicated values:

1 (2 + 3) 4 + 5 6 + 7 8 + 9 1 + 0 11 = 13
1 + 2 3 + 4 5 + 6 7 + 89 1 + 011 = 95

Lets consider the following puzzle: given two integers n and m (n > 0), decide if there exists an
n-alternation F that evaluates to m. From the examples above it is clear that it is possible to build
11-alternations that evaluate to 13 and 95. However, it is easy to see that it is impossible to find a
3-alternation that evaluates to 10.

In order to be precise in the description of the required task, an (arithmetic) formula is defined as
follows:

 The empty string is not a formula.

 A numeric string, i.e., a string made of digits 0 . . . 9, with at most 5 of them, is a formula.

 If  and  are formulae, then +  and   are formulae.

 If  is a formula, then +,  and () are formulae.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases, each one defined by a line containing two blank-separated
integers n and m (1  n  100, 107  m  107).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line with the character Y if there exists an n-alternation F that evaluates
to m, or with the character N, otherwise.

```

## Sample Input
