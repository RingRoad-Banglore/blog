title: Uva 11041  QuarterFinals with Brazil No
---


## Input

```
The FIFA World Cup of Germany 2006 is just going to start! This time, Spain cannot fail! We have
to win the cup, even though we meet Brazil in quarter-finals . . . Now, seriously, everybody knows the
Canarinha (Brazilian national football team) is the best team. But still we can play with statistics
and probabilities. For example, the German organizers (that are not so good as Brazil but very clever
people) have arranged the competition so that eventually Germany and Brazil could only meet in the
final. Very clever, indeed.

In this problem you will have to organize a Football World Cup, maximizing the probability that
our team wins the cup.

2N teams participate in a cup competition with N rounds. The teams are denoted by A, B, C, D,
etc. An arrangement of the competition is given by a string, e.g. ABCD, BDAC or BA. For example,
the string ABCDEFGH means that in first round the matches are (A vs. B), (C vs. D), (E vs. F), . . ., in
the second round (winner(A,B) vs. winner(C,D)), and so on.

We have scored all the teams with integer positive numbers, s(x); the greater the better. For
each pair of teams, A and B, we assume the probability that A beats B is given by the following:
P (A wins B) = s(A)/(s(A) + s(B))

Using this basic probability, we can compute the probability that A wins one round, two rounds,
three rounds, and eventually the probability to win the cup. For example, for the arrangement ABCD
the probability that A wins the cup is:

P (A wins ABCD) = P (A wins B)(P (A wins C)P (C wins D)+P (A wins D)P (D wins C))

You have to compute the arrangement that maximizes the probability that our team wins the cup.
If more than one arrangement is possible, you have to give the alphabetically first one.

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer M , indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains an integer N , between 1 and 5, indicating the number
of rounds in the competition. The second line contains a single character, indicating the letter of our
team. Then, we have a line with 2N integers indicating the scores of the teams, starting with A, that
is: s(A), s(B), s(C), and so on. In the case N = 5, lowercase letters are used to denote the teams form
27 to 32; and those letters are considered to be alphabetically greater than uppercase letters. That is,
the teams in order are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V,
W, X, Y, Z, a, b, c, d, e, f.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output should consist of a string with 2N characters, representing the desired
arrangement. Remember that you have to output the alphabetically first possibility, if the solution is
not unique.
