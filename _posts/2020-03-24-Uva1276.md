After computers have been invented, maybe computer games are one of the most important application
of computers in our lives. The fascinating image, the lovely voice and the attractive plot have made
those who are called games fans wallowed in computer game deeply. Although nowadays the most
advanced computer technologies in the world are used in computer games, game fans are not always
satisfied with the games, especially their prices. The more fasinating image, the lovelier voice, the more
attractive plot the computer game has, the higher price it has. And whats more, it requires game
fans to purchase the more advanced (which means the more expensive) equipments.

As you know, not every game fan has a large fortune. Facing various hardwares and softwares in
computer games, fans will be at a loss as they want to make a decision to buy some of them. But
unfortunately, fans have to purchase corresponding hardwares to play specail softwares. For instance,
Mario Bro. is one of Nintendo Incorporations software products, and only those who have Family
Computer (which is one of Nintendo Incorporations hardware products) can play it. So game fans
have to buy Family Computer before they want to buy Mario Bro.. Here is another instance about
Duck Hunter which is another game of Nintendo Incorporation. To play Duck Hunter, game fans
have to buy Laser Gun which is specially designed for Family Computer by Nintendo Incorporation.
Neither those who have Family Computer and Duck Hunter but without Laser Gun, nor those
who have Laser Gun and Duck Hunter but without Family Computer can play the game. And if
a game fan has Family Computer, he can play any games designed for Family Computer without
to purchase another Family Computer. For example, Mario Bro. and Mario Bro. II are both
designed for Family Computer, those who have a Family Computer could enjoy themselves fully
in playing Mario Bro. and Mario Bro.II. Finally, since game fans who have special hardwares and
softwares have fully enjoyed themselves in playing corresponding computer games, it wouldnt make
any sense for them to buy the same hardware or the same software. After all, the same hardware or
the same software will not bring game fans the additional pleasure.

In this problem, you will be given the description about a game fan, including his cash and the
detailed list of the hardwares and the softwares he wants to buy. The list includes the name of the
hardwares and the softwares, the equipments they depend on, their prices and the pleasure they will
bring to the fan. Its unlucky that the fan couldnt buy all the hardwares and the softwares in the
list, for his cash is limited. So you are required to write a program to help him. Your program should
calculate the maximum pleasure the fan could get and the cash he would pay for the corresponding
pleasure. Undoubtly, the fan should have the means to pay for the pleasure.

a) Your program should make a decision for each of the item in the detailed list whether buy or not,
but should not buy the same item twice or more times. That is, each item in the list should be
bought at most once.

b) if some items in the list arent bought, these items wouldnt bring any pleasure to the fan. And
also, other items which depend on those wouldnt bring the fan any pleasure either.

c) You may assume that such condition or the similar condition will not take place: in the detailed
list, item A depends on item B, item B depends on item C, item C depends on item A. The
relationship of the items in the list conform to the relationship of the forest.

d) You may assume that there would be no more than 32 items in the list depend on the same item.
And the level of the dependence is less than 5.

items in the list, each item in a seperate line. Each line contains 2 words and 2 integers. The first
word is the name of the item. The second word is another item it depends on. If the second word is
&, it suggests that the item doesnt depends on any other items. The first integer is ci (0  ci  1024),
the price for the item, and the second integer is hi (0  hi  100000), the pleasure the fan could get
form the item. The case with the first line containing a single # indicates the end of the input file.
And this case should not be processed.
