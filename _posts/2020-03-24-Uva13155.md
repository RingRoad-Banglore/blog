## Input

```text
Matrix is a collection of data, i.e. [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 0, 6] is an example of 1D matrix of integers. Matrix can
be of any dimension. Phase of a matrix is another matrix, defines the comparison of matrix elements
with respect to the adjacent elements. Here 3<4, 4<5, 5>1, 1<2, 2>0, 0<6. If 1 resembles a < and
0 resembles a >, phase of the above mentioned matrix is [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1].

Now a 2D matrix can be visualized as a collection of 1D row matrices placed vertically one after
another or as a collection of 1D column matrices placed horizontally one beside another. The phase
of a 2D matrix is a combination of row phase matrices and column phase matrices. Every single
row(/column) of the row(/column) phase matrix is generated from the corresponding row(/column) of
the original 2D matrix. For example, the phase of the 2D matrix on the left is the combination of two
boolean 2D matrices on the right in the following picture.

A 2D matrix is harmonic if,
 All the rows of the row phase matrix are same and

 All the columns of the column phase matrix are same.

Following matrix on the left is the shuffled version of the previous one. But it satisfies the above
mentioned two criteria. So its a harmonic matrix.

Given a 2D matrix of distinct integers, your task is to shuffle the elements of the matrix so that
it becomes harmonic. For shuffling, you can perform only one kind of operation, take two adjacent
elements vertically or horizontally and swap them. You have to sequentially output all the swap
operations you need to do to shuffle the given matrix. But the number of swaps you are performing
cant be infinite, right?

## Output

```text
First line of the input is an integer T (1  T  15), the number of test cases. Following lines contain
T test cases. A case starts with a line containing space separated integers R and C (1  R,C  1003)
representing the number of row and column of the input matrix. Each of the following R lines contains
C space separated integers which constitutes the input matrix A. You can assume that all the elements
of matrix A are distinct, strictly positive and do not exceed 1000000009.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output contains the test case id in the first line. Next line contains an integer n,
the number of swap operations you are performing to make the array harmonic. Each of the following
n lines contains the swap operation formatted with four integers r1, c1, r2, c2 (1  r1, r2  R and
1  c1, c2  C). Condition (|r1  r2| + |c1  c2|) = 1 should hold, this means you are swapping two
adjacent elements A(r1, c1) and A(r2, c2). The number of swap operations has to be bounded
by 2.5 R  C, that means n can be at most 2.5 R  C.

See the sample for exact format. Any valid answer that satisfies the constraints will be accepted.
