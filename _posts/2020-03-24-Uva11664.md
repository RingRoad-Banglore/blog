title: Uva 11664  Langtons Ant
---


## Input

```text
Langtons ant, after the mathematician Christopher Langton, is a cellular automaton with a very
simple set of rules but interesting emergent behavior; this behavior is currently the matter of research
for some mathematicians. The analogy between ants and Langtons cellular automaton comes from the
observation that one can arbitrarily identify the state of the automaton as the ant, and the dynamics
of the automaton with the ability of the ant to travel in a special world.

The ant worlds is an n  n plane where the squares (or cells) on the plane are colored variously
either blue or red. The number n is called the size of the world. A cell is denoted with a pair (i, j),
(1  i, j  n). The ant lives and moves in single steps following the rules below:

 if it is on a blue cell, it flips the color of the cell, turns 
2

to the left, and moves forward to the
next cell in the direction it is facing;

 if it is on a red cell, it flips the color of the cell, turns 
2

to the right, and moves forward to the
next cell in the direction it is facing; and

 if a movement is impossible (because the ant cannot move out of the world), then the ant dies.

For example, let us assume the ant is in a red cell while facing east. If there is not a cell immediately
to its south, then the ant dies. On the contrary, if there is a cell immediately to its south, then the ant
takes a single step by moving to this cell to which it arrives facing south and the color of its source cell
flips to blue. Then, the ant will try to take another single step, and so on.

Your task is to determine if the ant can go to the (n, n) cell of a world, given (i) the configuration of
the world, and (ii) the initial position of the ant. You are to assume the ants initial direction is north.

## Output

```text
The configuration of an n  n world can be codified as a natural number in binary notation by using
n2 bits. We adopt the following conventions: 0 = blue, 1 = red, and the binary representation of the
configuration identifies the cells of the world from left to right and from bottom to top (considering the
bits from the most significant bit to the least significant bit). For example, the binary number 0100 (4
in decimal notation) represents a 2 2 world with the following configuration:

blue blue
blue red

Coherently, the binary number 011010100 (212 in decimal notation) represents a 3  3 world with
the following configuration:

red blue blue
blue red blue
blue red red

The problem input has several test cases. Each case consists of a single line containing a list of four
natural numbers, n, c, x, y, separated by blanks, that should be interpreted as:

 n (1  n  16): the size of the world;

 c (0  c < 2(n2)): decimal representation of an n2-bit binary number that describes an initial
configuration of the world, as above explained;

 (x, y): coordinates of the initial position of the ant in the world (1  x, y  n), where the position
(n, n) corresponds to the least significant bit of c.

The end of the input is indicated by a line where n = c = x = y = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case your solution should output:

 Yes if the ant reaches the cell (n, n) from the initial position;

 Kaputt! if the ant dies without reaching the cell (n, n) from the initial position.

For each test case, its guaranteed that after a finite number of steps, the ant reaches the cell (n, n)
or dies without reaching the cell (n, n).

## Sample Output

2 4 1 1
2 15 1 1
0 0 0 0
