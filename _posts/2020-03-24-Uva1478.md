title: Uva 01478  Delta Wave
---


## Input

```text

A delta wave is a high amplitude brain wave in humans with a frequency of 1. . . 4 hertz
which can be recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG) and is usually associated with
slow-wave sleep (SWS).

 from Wikipedia

The researchers have discovered a new kind of species called otaku, whose brain waves are rather
strange. The delta wave of an otakus brain can be approximated by a polygonal line in the 2D
coordinate system. The line is a route from point (0, 0) to (N , 0), and it is allowed to move only to
the right (up, down or straight) at every step. And during the whole moving, it is not allowed to dip
below the y = 0 axis.

For example, there are the 9 kinds of delta waves for N = 4:

Given N , you are requested to find out how many kinds of different delta waves of otaku.
```

## Output

```text
There are no more than 20 test cases. There is only one line for each case, containing an integer N
(2 < N  10000)

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output one line for each test case. For the answer may be quite huge, you need only output the answer
module 10100.
