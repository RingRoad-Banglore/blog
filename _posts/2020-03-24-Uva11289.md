## Input

```
Luke has a bit of trouble telling the difference between
star systems in the Rebel Alliance and those in the
Empire. He has a list of the x,y,z coordinates of each
system in the Empire and each in the Alliance, but
at warp speed he simply has insufficient time to look
up systems in his lists.

After destroying the friendly planet Endor, Luke
has had to admit he needs the help of his targeting
computer. His computer, being an early model, can
only compute the truth value of the inequality

ax+ by + cz + d > 0

Where x, y, z are the coordinates of the system,
and a, b, c, d are real-valued coefficients. You are to
compute a, b, c, d so that the inequality holds for all
systems in the Empire, and for no systems in the Alliance.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several test cases followed by -1 -1. Each test case first gives the number of Alliance
systems, followed by a line for each system giving the integer coordinates 100  x, y, z  100 of the
system in 3-dimensional space. The number of Empire systems, and the coordinates of each, follow.
The Empire and Alliance combined have at least one and no more than 200 systems. All systems have
distinct coordinates.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single line containing a, b, c, d as real numbers separated by spaces. Use
enough precision to ensure that your solution is correct. You may assume that a solution exists; if there
is more than one solution, any one will do.
