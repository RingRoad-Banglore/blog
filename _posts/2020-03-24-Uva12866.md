```
The number of ways in which r objects can be chosen from n different objects can be found using the
formula

(
n
r

)
= n!

r!(nr)! .

For example
(
5
3

)
= 10,

(
10
0

)
= 1,

(
15
14

)
= 15, etc. Now if n varies from low to high and r varies from

0 to n, then you have to find out how many values of
(
n
r

)
are odd. In other words you will have to find

out the value of
high
n=low

n
r=0

(
n

r

)
mod 2, here mod is the standard modulus or reminder operation.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 50,000 lines of inputs. Each line contains two positive integers low and
high (0  low  high  16  1011). Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input, produce one line of output. This line contains an integer D which prints the
desired value. You can safely assume that this output will fit in a 64-bit unsigned integer.

Note:
Illustration for Sample input 1:

(
2
0

)
= 1,

(
2
1

)
= 2,

(
2
2

)
= 1,

(
3
0

)
= 1,

(
3
1

)
= 3,

(
3
2

)
= 3,

(
3
3

)
= 1, and of

these seven values, six (6) are odd.

```

## Sample Input

```
2 3
10 20
100 200
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
6
70
2510
```
