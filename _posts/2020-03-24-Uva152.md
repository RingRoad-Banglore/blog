## Input

```
Dr William Larch, noted plant psychologist and inventor of the phrase Think like a tree  Think Fig
has invented a new classification system for trees. This is a complicated system involving a series of
measurements which are then combined to produce three numbers (in the range [0, 255]) for any given
tree. Thus each tree can be thought of as occupying a point in a 3-dimensional space. Because of the
nature of the process, measurements for a large sample of trees are likely to be spread fairly uniformly
throughout the whole of the available space. However Dr Larch is convinced that there are relationships
to be found between close neighbours in this space. To test this hypothesis, he needs a histogram of
the numbers of trees that have closest neighbours that lie within certain distance ranges.

Write a program that will read in the parameters of up to 5000 trees and determine how many of
them have closest neighbours that are less than 1 unit away, how many with closest neighbours 1 or
more but less than 2 units away, and so on up to those with closest neighbours 9 or more but less
than 10 units away. Thus if di is the distance between the ith point and its nearest neighbour(s) and
j  di < k, with j and k integers and k = j + 1, then this point (tree) will contribute 1 to the jth bin
in the histogram (counting from zero). For example, if there were only two points 1.414 units apart,
then the histogram would be 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

## Output

```
Input will consist of a series of lines, each line consisting of 3 numbers in the range [0, 255]. The file
will be terminated by a line consisting of three zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output will consist of a single line containing the 10 numbers representing the desired counts, each
number right justified in a field of width 4.
