title: Uva 12759  Increasingly Strict Sequence
---


## Input

```

Given a sequence of N integers A = {A[1], A[2], . . . , A[N ]} and all of the integers has an equal number
of digits. You are allowed to perform the following operation on the sequence as many times as you
wish:

Change a single digit from some integer into a different digit. You goal is to obtain a strictly
increasing sequence where none of the numbers has a leading zero.

What is the minimum number of operations required to achieve this goal? Note that, the input
sequence can have numbers with leading zeros.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains an integer T (T  30) denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each
test case contains N (1  N  50) denoting the number of integers in the input sequence. Each of the
next N lines contains an integer containing at most 50 digits. The numbers will contain equal number
of digits.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the answer in the format Case X: Y , where X is the serial of the input
and Y is the minimum number of operations required to convert the input sequence into a strictly
increasing sequence. If it is not possible to achieve this goal, print -1
