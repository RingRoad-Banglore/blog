10946 You want what filled?
Now that Ryan and Larry infuriated the
bear, they’re now forced to do menial
tasks for food, one such task is filling in
potholes on this deserted island. But of
course, it’s never quite that easy, as the
bear forces them to fill in the biggest hole
first. Since Ryan and Larry are still lazy
(very little has changed, you see), can you
tell them the order to fill in the holes?

## Input
The first line will contain two numbers x
and y, followed by x lines of y characters
each. (x and y are less than 50). The
holes will be represented by the uppercase
characters A to Z, and regular land will be represented by ‘.’. There will be no other characters in the
map. Input will be terminated by having ‘0 0’ as input.

## Output
For each map, output the problem number (as shown below), then output the hole represented by the
character, and the number of space the hole takes up, sorted by the size of the hole, break ties by
sorting the characters in alphabetical order, as shown in the sample output on a separate line as shown
below:

## Sample Input
