title: Uva 10542  Hyper-drive

## Input

```text
Hyper-drive is a term that is very frequently used in
science fiction stories. Although, many believe that
hyper-drive is not at all possible, many explanations
and theories exist on the existence of wormholes and
hyper-drives. Many say that hyper-drive is a journey
through higher dimensions. In this problem we will
try to calculate our cost of traveling through higher
dimension based on a theory described by our old
mad friend Arif. I am sure that you remember Arif.
You can ask your team mates if you dont remember.

Let P and Q be two points in n-dimensional space. Let the coordinates of P be (p1, p2, . . . , pn) and
the coordinates of Q be (q1, q2, . . . , qn). The universal n-dimensional space is divided into many unit
n-dimensional hyper-cubes. For visual example look at the picture below to realize how a (5  4  3)
three dimensional universal space can be divided into 60 three dimensional unit hyper-cubes (111).

Please dont ask for a visual example in higher dimension. The cost of traveling from one n-
dimensional P point to another n-dimensional point Q is equal to the number of different n-dimensional
unit hyper-cubes that the straight line joining these two points passes through.. Your job is to determine
this cost for two given points. For example in the previous picture the cost of hyper-drive from C to E
is 10 units as EC passes through 10 different three dimensional hyper-cubes.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N  501) that denotes how many sets of inputs
are there. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with an integer D (0 < D  10) which denotes in what dimension we want to
measure the cost. Each of the next two lines contains D integers. The D integers in the first line denote
the coordinates for P and the D integers in the second line denotes the coordinates for Q. All these
integers will be positive and fit within 32-bit signed integer.

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of the output and then
the cost of traveling from P to Q, which will obviously be an integer. Look at the sample output below
for details.

Note: In the first sample output for sample input the cost of traveling from (10, 10) to (10, 13) is
shown zero because the line connecting these two points does not really enter any two dimensional
hyper-cube. The line just goes along the edges of the two dimensional hyper-cubes.
