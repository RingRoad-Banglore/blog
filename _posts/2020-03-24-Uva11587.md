```
SH and TR are playing the famous brick game. For those who ar-
ent aware of the rules of this illustrious game, here goes a brief description:

 Its a two player game in which there is initially some number of
bricks on a table.

 Each player moves alternately. Player 1 makes the first move. In
our case, SH is player 1.

 In each move, a player removes some number of bricks from the
table. The number of bricks that can be removed in a single move
must be a member of a certain set of K numbers.

 The player to remove the last brick wins the game. If a player
finds that he cant make any valid move in his turn, he loses the
game.

Both SH and TR have recently spent a lot of time working out at the gym. They have acquired
enough strength to lift a lot of bricks in a single move. However, the bricks that they are playing with
are quite heavy and in a single move a player can remove at most 20 bricks from the table.

The set, thus, can be represented as S = {0 < A1 < A2 < A3 < . . . < AK1 < AK < 21}

You will be given a string consisting of N characters. The i-th (1  i  N) character represents the
state if there were initially i bricks. A state is symbolized by L or W and they represent losing states
and winning states, respectively. The states are calculated based on the fact that both of them play
perfectly. For example, if the 10-th character of the given string is L, then no matter what strategy SH
follows he will always end up losing if they start with 10 bricks.

Given the states, your job is to minimize the cardinality of the set S; that is you have to minimize
the value of K. Note that the set cannot be empty. You will also need to find the members of the set
S. In case there are multiple sets with the same minimum cardinality that satisfies the given states,
you have to select the one that comes lexicographically earliest. Set S1 will come earlier than S2, if in
the first differing element S1s corresponding value has a lesser magnitude.

Example: (1, 3, 6) will come before (1, 4, 5).
```

## Input

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 201) that indicates the number of test cases. Each of the
next T lines contains a string consisting of characters L and W only. The length of a string is at most
100.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the case number first. Then output the set of K elements in ascending order
based on the description given above. It is guaranteed that there will be at least 1 set of numbers that
will yield the given states in the input.
