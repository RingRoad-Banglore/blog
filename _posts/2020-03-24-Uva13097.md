title: Uva 13097  Tobby and the LED display
---


```
Tobby got his first job! Being a lazy puppy, the work that he has found is not very demanding and
it consists of observing a LED display during T minutes and reporting the status of the LED display
once this time runs out. The LED display is capable of displaying N characters and the text can move
in two directions, Left or Right. In every minute the character that occupies the ith position moves to
the (i  1)-th or (i + 1)-th position, depending on the direction in which the text moves in the LED
display.

The LED display works in a circular way, therefore, if the character that occupies the i = 1 position
moves to the left its new position will be i = N , moreover, if the character that occupies the i = N
position moves to the right its new position will be i = 1.

i.e. if Tobby got the board shown below where N = 10, T = 3 and the direction in which the text
moves is Right, the following will happen:

Minute 0
+-------------------+
| | | |T|o|b|b|y|!|!|
+-------------------+

Minute 1
+-------------------+
|!| | | |T|o|b|b|y|!|
+-------------------+

Minute 2
+-------------------+
|!|!| | | |T|o|b|b|y|
+-------------------+

After 3 minutes, Tobby should report the board shown below.

+-------------------+
|y|!|!| | | |T|o|b|b|
+-------------------+

As it has been said, Tobby is very lazy and wont spends his time on this boring task, thats why he
is willing to give you a bone from his first payment as reward :).

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases and must be read until EOF.

The first line of each test case contains two integers N , T (1  N  50000, 1  T  1014), and one
character D (D = L or D = R), here N indicates the number of characters that the LED display can
show, T shows the number of minutes that Tobby must wait to report the LED display state and D is
the direction in which the LED display will work L = Left and R = Right.

Then, there will be 3 lines and each one has (2N) + 1 characters. The first and third line are
the upper edge and the lower edge respectively of the LED display, The second line shows the initial
content of the LED display.

## Output

```
For each test case the output must consist of 3 lines each one will have (2N) + 1 characters. The first
and third line are the upper edge and the lower edge respectively of the LED display and the second
one will show the LED display state after T minutes.
