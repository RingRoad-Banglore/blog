## Input

```
All of you have typed in mobile phones. In this problem, you will
have to do a similar thing.

You are given a word. You will have to process it. There are
two phases in each step.

Type the given word using standard mobile keyboard, that is,
press the digit containing the required letter once.

Convert each digit found in the first phase into word, con-
catenate those words, and produce a new word.

For example, if you are asked to type DHAKA.

Step 1, phase 1:
34252

Step 1, phase 2:
THREEFOURTWOFIVETWO

Step 2, phase 1:
8473336878963483896

Step 2, phase 2:
EIGHTFOURSEVENTHREETHREETHREESIXEIGHTSEVENEIGHTNINESIXTHREEFOUREIGHTTHREEEIGHTNINESIX

And so on...
Your job is to find the k-th character after n-th step.
```

## Output

```
First line of input will consist of number of test cases, T (1  T  1000). Each of the next T lines
contains the initial word, W (1  |W |  100), n (1  n  20), k (1  k  109), separated by a space.
n will be such that k-th character is always found. The initial word will contain only uppercase letter
of English alphabet and no space within it.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, first print the test case number, followed by the k-th character after processing the
initial word up to n-th step.

Note: Spellings of the digits:
0  ZERO, 1  ONE, 2  TWO, 3  THREE, 4  FOUR, 5  FIVE, 6  SIX, 7  SEVEN, 8 

EIGHT, 9  NINE

```

## Sample Output

```
4
DHAKA 1 1
DHAKA 2 1
DHAKA 1 5
DHAKA 2 10
