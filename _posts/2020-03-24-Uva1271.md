## Input

```

Splendid bangles inlaid with gorgeous diamonds are the special products of jewelry factories. With the
industrialization of jewelry manufacture, common bangles become cheaper than ever. But the dream
of ownning characteristic bangle becomes costlier than ever. For this reason, a jewelry factory designed
a new kind of bangle inlaid with various diamonds according to customers demand, which realized the
dream of ownning characteristic bangle.

But one day the manager of a jwewlry factory asked himself, How many kinds of bangles I could
produce with the same style? That is, if the bangle has m places to be inlaid with diamonds and he
has n kinds of diamonds to inlay, how may different kinds of bangles he could produce?

As you know, bangle is a circular jewelry. The places to be inlaid with diamonds are spaced equally
round the circle. And also, the bangle could be rotated and turned over. We assume that there are two
bangles. And we rotate and turn over a bangle for some times, then the bangle becomes the same as
another one. We should regard the two bangles as the same kind.
