title: Uva 11793  Electoral Districts
---


```
In a certain democracy, the party in the government is reorganizing the electoral districts in order to
benefit them in the next election.

One delegate is elected for each district. And, as the regime is de facto a two-party system, they
just need one more vote than the opposition for each district.

The country is divided into a square mesh of N N zones; these zones are grouped into electoral
districts. There are N districts, and each district is composed by N adjacent zones, which means each
zone in the district has a common border (on the left, right, up or down) with at least another zone in
the same district.

Suppose the party in the government is A, and the party in the opposition is B. From previous
elections, we know the number of votes for each party in each zone. Two N N matrices are available,
one with the number of votes for party A, and another one for the votes for party B.

For each district, we take the sum of the votes of its zones. Then, the party with more total votes in
that district gains a delegate. If the number of votes is equal for A and B, then no delegate is assigned.

Party A has hired you to compute the largest possible difference they can obtain in number of
delegates with an adequate arrangement of the districts.

## Input

```
The input begins with a line where the number of test cases (T ) is indicated. The data for each test
case appear in successive lines. For each test case, the first line contains the dimension of the country
(N , with maximum value 5, and the country has N by N zones). Following, there are 2N lines, each
line with N integers between 1 and 1000, separated by a space. The first N lines contain the votes for
party A, and the other N lines the votes for party B.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of T lines, one for each test case. For each case, the maximum achievable difference
between the number of delegates obtained by party A with respect to party B is represented.
