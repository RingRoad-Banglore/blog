title: Uva 12597  MacaW Baby Learns Computer
---


## Input

```text
The newborn Macaw baby is learning computer now. But as the Macaw dad cannot afford much so
he has bought a computer that supports only floating-point data type (No support for integers). But
as birds dont give exams (no CGPA calculation), dont calculate probability (Ignoring problem-setter
birds) and dont intentionally share food so they rarely do floating-point calculations. Luckily, floating-
point numbers can hold many integer values perfectly. Now your job is to convince the Macaw dad
how good a floating-point number is in holding integer values. For this problem floating-point numbers
(Similar to real world no doubt) are stored in the following way:

Suppose there is a binary number 10112, then to store it in computer as a floating-point number, it is
divided into two parts,(a) mantissa (b) exponent. If value of mantissa part is mv, then 1

2
 mv < 1.

So it is stored as, 0.1011  24 (Assuming there is 4 bits of storage for mantissa). In other words the
four bits allocated for mantissa contains 1011 and the exponent part contains the value 4 (In binary
of course). As the most significant bit of mantissa is always 1 so it is not even stored at all. So for
storing 10112 the mantissa part contains 011 (Ignoring the most siginificantbit 1) and the exponent part
contains 100 (Binary equivalent of 4). Given the number of bits allocated for mantissa and exponent,
your job is to find out how many different positive integer values can this floating-point number
represent. In real life in floating-point number a bit is used for sign of number and another bit is used
for sign of exponent. Those two bits are not needed for this problem (As negative integers are not
counted and negative exponent never makes a positive integer value)
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 1000 lines of input. Each line contains two integers m (1  m  60)
and e (1  e  60) which denotes the number of bits allocated for mantissa and exponent respectively.

A line containing two zeroes terminates the input. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case produce one line of output. This line contains an integer which denotes how many
different positive integer values this floating-point number can represent. You can assume that the
input values will be such that this integer will not exceed 9  1018.
Illustration of the first sample input:

A floating-point number that has two bits for mantissa and two bits for exponent can represent
the following values (Not less than 1) 1.000000, 1.250000, 1.500000, 1.750000, 2.000000, 2.500000,
3.000000, 3.500000, 4.000000, 5.000000, 6.000000 and 7.000000. Of these values only 7 values are
integers.

## Sample Output

```text
2 2
3 4
