title: Uva 00261  The Window Property
---


## Input

```
Suppose you are given a sequence of symbols but you can see only k (k  1) consecutive symbols at
a time. Then we say the length of the window is k. Moving this window along the sequence can give
you a lot of different patterns. Of all possible sequences of n different symbols only a minority has the
property that the windows of length k show only k + 1 different patterns.

We say that a sequence of symbols has the window property if for all natural k the number of
different patterns you can see through a window of length k is at most k + 1.

Examples

ABAABABAB has the window property.
ABCABCABC does not have the window property (check k = 1).
011010 has the window property.
0110100101 does not have the window property.

In the third example the patterns are :

length 1 : 0, 1.
length 2 : 01, 11, 10.
length 3 : 011, 110, 101, 010.
length 4 : 0110, 1101, 1010.
length 5 : 01101, 11010.
length 6 : 011010.

The sequence in the last example is an extension of the sequence in the third example. So the first
6 symbols form a sequence with the window property. The seventh symbol adds the pattern 00 to
the set of patterns of length 2 displayed in the windows preceding the window containing 00. So the
sequence formed by the first 7 symbols does not have the window property. Accordingly we call the
seventh symbol the first offending symbol. By the way we count from left-to-right as our computers
seem to do.

The problem is to determine whether a given sequence has the window property and if not, to find
the position of the first offending symbol  this is that symbol such that the sequence preceding it has
the window property but adding the symbol destroys this property (counting of the symbols starts at
one).
```

## Output

```
The input is a textfile where each line is a non-empty sequence of (ASCII) characters to be checked for
the window property. No sequence will be longer than one hundred symbols.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output file should be a textfile containing for each line of the input a line with the result of the
check for the window property in the following way: YES (uppercase) if the line enjoys the window
property, otherwise NO: (in uppercase) followed by the position of the offending symbol. Each line
should be terminated by an end-of-line marker.
