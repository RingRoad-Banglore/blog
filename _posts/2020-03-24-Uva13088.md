title: Uva 13088  Lexicographically Smallest FPIS
---


## Input

```
A Permutation Insensitive String (PIS) is a string which does not change even if the positions of the
characters are interchanged. For example, if the value of a PIS is abc it can also be written as acb,
bca etc. A Frequency Insensitive String (FIS) is a string whose value does not change if the frequency
of any character is increased or decreased (Without altering the total length and without removing any
character completely). So if the value of an FIS is aabc it can also be abbc, or abcc. An FPIS
(Frequency and Permutation Insensitive String) is a string that is both permutation and frequency
insensitive. Given an FPIS you will have to write the lexicographically smallest version of it.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input file contains an integer T (T  1000) which denotes how many strings to follow.
Each of the next T lines contains a single FPIS containing at most 1000 characters. All these characters
are from lower case English alphabet.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each string in the input produce one line of output. This line contains lexicographically smallest
version of the input FPIS.

The way you find lexicographic order is:

1. Compare the first (Leftmost) character of both strings. If they are different, order is given by the
order of the two characters. (a is less than b, y is (usually) less than z)

2. If they are the same, move on to the next character of both strings.

3. If you run out of characters in one of the strings, that one comes first.

4. If you run out of characters in both strings, they are equal.

```

## Sample Output

```
4
bca
pqab
aabb
c

```
