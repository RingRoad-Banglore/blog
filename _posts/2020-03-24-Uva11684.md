```
The Dean has determined that mathies have
outgrown the building that has served them
so well for many years. Luckily for him, the
PM has decided to stimulate the economy by
funding a new math building. To maximize the
stimulating effect, the construction process is
outsourced to a software engineering consultant
who employs agile methodologies. The build-
ing will be built first, and designed later. The
Dean has some concerns about this innovative
process. After all, it would be very embarrass-
ing if the walls of the new math building failed
to line up at right angles!

The Dean sneaks out one night with a tape
measure to survey the last remaining grassy
area on campus, where the new building will go. He drives stakes into the ground, then measures
the distances between them. Afterwards, he retreats into his office to construct a map from his mea-
surements. He notices that the first three stakes form a right-angled triangle with arms of length one
metre and hypotenuse of length sqrt(2) metres. And thats not all. The Dean plots these first three
stakes on a piece of graph paper at coordinates (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0). After plotting some of the other
stakes, it turns out that all of the stakes happen to be precisely at lattice points (i.e. points with integer
coordinates) on the graph paper. Still, plotting all of the many stakes is tedious, so he asks his co-op
student (i.e. you) to help out.

## Input

```
Input consists of a number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m,
each at least 1 and no larger than 1000. The integer n is the number of lines that follow, and m is the
number of stakes. The stakes are numbered from 1 to m. Each of the following lines contains exactly
six integers a, b, c, x, y, z. The integers a, b, and c are the numbers of three stakes. The three stakes
are always listed in counter-clockwise order. That is, to move from stake a to stake b and then to stake
c, one must turn left at stake b. The number x is the square of the distance from stake a to stake b.
The number y is the square of the distance from stake b to stake c. The number z is the square of the
distance from stake c to stake a. Every stake will appear in at least one line of the input. For every pair
of stakes a, b, there is a subset of the triangles in the input that forms a sequence T1, T2, , Tn such
that two of the vertices of Ti are also vertices of Ti+1 for all i, a is a vertex of T1, and b is a vertex of
Tn. The last line of input is 0 0. These zeros are not values of n and m, and should not be processed
as such.

## Output

```
Output consists of exactly m lines for each test case. The m lines describe the stakes 1 to m in sequence.
Each line contains two integers, giving the x and y coordinates of the stake. The first three lines of
output for each test case are always:
