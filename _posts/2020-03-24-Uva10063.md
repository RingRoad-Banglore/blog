## Input

```text
There are some permutation generation techniques in Knuths book The Art of Computer Program-
ming - Volume 1. One of the processes is as follows:

For each permutation A1A2 . . . An1 form n others by inserting a character n in all possible places
obtaining

nA1A2 . . . An1, A1nA2 . . . An1, . . . , A1A2 . . . nAn1, A1A2 . . . An1n

For example, from the permutation 231 inserting 4 in all possible places we get 4231 2431 2341 2314
Following this rule you have to generate all the permutation for a given set of characters. All the

given characters will be different and there number will be less than 10 and they all will be alpha
numerals. This process is recursive and you will have to start recursive call with the first character and
keep inserting the other characters in order. The sample input and output will make this clear. Your
output should exactly mach the sample output for the sample input.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several lines of input. Each line will be a sequence of characters. There will be less
than ten alphanumerals in each line. The input will be terminated by End of File.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input generate the permutation of those characters. The input ordering is very important
for the output. That is the permutation sequence for abc and bca will not be the same.

Separate each set of permutation output with a blank line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
abc
bca
dcba

```
