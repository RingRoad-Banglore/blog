title: Uva 12619  Just Make A Wish

```
If you are given two sides of a rectangle, you can find the area of the rectangle very easily. But can
you do the opposite? Given the area of a rectangle can you tell me how many different rectangles can
have this area, provided the sides of the rectangles must be integer? Two rectangles are equal only if
the sides are same. You cannot rotate a rectangle. So if the area is 6 there are 4 different rectangles
are possible. They are 1x6, 2x3, 3x2 and 6x1.

This problem is very easy and I am sure you can solve it in a minute. Your problem is much tougher.
One of your friends Po has got a magic Genie. Every day the Genie grants Po a wish. When asked
to grant the wish, the Genie (depending on its mood) tells a number. If its positive then Pos land
gets multiplied by that number. If its negative then Pos land is divided by the absolute value of that
number. So every day, Po tells you the area of the land Po owns. You need to find out how many
different rectangles can have that area. And then output the summation after D days. Initially the
area of land Po owns is 1.
```

## Input

```
First line of input consists of an integer, T (T  10), the number of test cases. Each case starts with
an integer, D (0 < D  106), the number of days this wish granting will go on. Next D lines each has
an integer G (0 < |G|  106), the number with which Pos lands area will be multiplied or divided. If
G is negative, it will be a divisor of Pos land area.

```

## Output

```
For each case print one line Case X: where X is the case number. Then for each wish of a day, find
the number of different of rectangles you can make which will have the same area as Pos land and
output the summation after D days. As this can be much bigger, output modulo 1000000007 (109+7).

Sample Explanation:
1st day: Area = 12  6 ways.
2nd day: Area = 36  9 ways.
3 day: Area= 18  6 ways.
4 day: Area = 90  12 ways.
5 day: Area = 15  4 ways.
So in total (6+9+6+12+4) = 37 ways.
