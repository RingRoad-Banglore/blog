title: Uva 11350  Stern-Brocot Tree
---


## Input

```text
In number theory, the Stern-Brocot tree is a method of listing all non-negative rational numbers as well
as a point representing infinity (here represented formally as 1/0).

The tree may be created by an iterative process. It is easiest to describe as a list. Beginning with
the list {0/1, 1/0} representing 0 and infinity respectively, one places between any two fractions the
mediant of the fractions (the mediant of a/c and b/d is (a + b)/(c + d)). The first few steps of this
process yield:

{0/1, 1/0}
{0/1, 1/1, 1/0}
{0/1, 1/2, 1/1, 2/1, 1/0}
{0/1, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1/1, 3/2, 2/1, 3/1, 1/0}
This process can be represented as a tree where each row corresponds to the new numbers added

at each step.

From Wikipedia

The position of a fraction in the tree can be specified as a path consisting of L(left) an
R(right) moves along the tree starting from the top (fraction 1/1). Your have to find a
fraction by a given path.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains integer N (0 < N  10000), it is number of tests. On next N lines there is a
path in the tree. Path is the string if maximum length of 90 characters consisting from characters L
or R.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print line formatted like this: a/b. Where a is numerator and b is denominator of
the fraction.
