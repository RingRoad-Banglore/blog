## Input

```text
Have you watched the science fiction movie Sphere? In this movie there is an sphere from outer space
which enables a man to convert his night-mares into reality. That is if you dream that you are being
attacked by lion, in reality your surrounding people will be attacked by lion. The problem is that the
alien people who sent the Sphere are now in earth. They have made an artificial island to stay which is
surrounded by unknown poisonous liquid. The scientists of earth have failed to determine the chemical
structure of this liquid but has succeeded to determine one of its physical properties, the specific gravity
(S. G.). This S. G. of liquid changes with time. So our scientists measure the S. G. every hour. The
aliens dont attack us. What they do is very simple, they just release paired-spheres on the poisonous
stream of liquid and these paired spheres float towards human civilization and then materializes our
night mares. As these are paired spheres their destructive power is twice of the previous sphere. The
aliens are not good in physics and maths. So some of the paired spheres created by them sinks in the
poisonous liquid. As our scientists are very good in physics we can determine the weight of the spheres
but sadly they are very week in mathematics. So they ask your help to determine the volume and
surface area of the paired sphere and also asks you to determine whether it will float in the liquid or
sink. You can be sure that the input values and output specification will be such that you will not have
to think about precisions in case of sink and float. Consider  = 2  arccos(0);

looks like two circles actually they are

## Output

```text
First line of the input file will be an integer N which indicates how many sets of inputs are there. The
next N lines will contain N sets of input.

Each set (or lines) contain five integers R1 (0 < R1  500) and R2 (0 < R2  500) (The radius of the
two spheres of the paired sphere in centimeter), d (The distance between the centers of the two spheres
in centimeter and d > max(R1, R2) and d < (R1+R2)), W the weight of the sphere (W < 10000000000)
in grams and S (0 < S < 10) the specific gravity of the poisonous liquid.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input there will be two lines of output. The first line will be the volume of the sphere
and the surface area of the sphere (four digits after the decimal point) and the second line will be any
of the two according to the situation The Paired-Sphere Sinks. or The Paired-Sphere Floats.
