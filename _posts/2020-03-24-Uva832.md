title: Uva 00832  Financial Risk
---


## Input

```
As a rule the ACME Corporation clients pay within 30 days from shipment. Nevertheless, there is the
risk that a client may be unable to fulfill its responsibility. The ACME Corporation transfered this risk
to a financial insurance company that covers the responsibility of each customer up to a certain debt
ceiling, depending on the customer financial record.

In order not to displease its clients the policy of the ACME Corporation is to continue selling to a
client after reaching the debt ceiling imposed by the financial insurance company. In this case the risk
above the debt ceiling is assumed by the ACME Corporation.

The CEO of the ACME Corporation has to decide if the clients debt ceiling needs to be renegotiated
with the financial insurance company. For that she wants to know what percentage of the clients debt
is not being covered by the insurance company in the present deal.

The ACME Financial Department came up with a formula to measure a client risk. Consider the
step function Dc(t)  the debt of client c at time t, as exemplified bellow.

The risk associated with a debt is the area defined by function and the x axis, i.e. the risk between
time t0 and t1 the integral

 t1
t0

Dc(t). Considering that each client c has a debt ceiling Lc the uncovered
risk is just the area above the debt ceiling that can be defined as the integral t1

t0

p(Dc(t) Lc) where p(x) =
{
x if x  0
0 if x < 0

Thus, the percentage of uncovered risk for all clients is the quotient of the sum of all uncovered
risks by the sum of all risks, as given by the following formula:

c

 t1
t0

p(Dc(t) Lc)
c

 t1
t0

Dc(t)

Your task is to write a program to compute the percentage of uncovered risk in the last fiscal year,
using the formula above and the data provided by a listing of the ACMEs ERP.

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The listing you will use as input starts with the number of clients with sales in the last fiscal year.
For each client the first line has the debt limit and the number of sales. In the following lines, one for
each sale, there is the sales value, the day of the year of the invoice and the day of the year of the
receipt.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

Your program must write the percentage of uncovered risk, truncated to 2 fractional digits. Note
that the output must include the percent sign (%).
