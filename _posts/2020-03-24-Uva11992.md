title: Uva 11992  Fast Matrix Operations
---


```
There is a matrix containing at most 106 elements divided into r rows and c columns. Each element
has a location (x, y) where 1  x  r, 1  y  c. Initially, all the elements are zero. You need to
handle four kinds of operations:

1 x1 y1 x2 y2 v Increment each element (x, y) in submatrix (x1, y1, x2, y2) by
v (v > 0)

2 x1 y1 x2 y2 v Set each element (x, y) in submatrix (x1, y1, x2, y2) to v
3 x1 y1 x2 y2 Output the summation, min value and max value of subma-

trix (x1, y1, x2, y2)

In the above descriptions, submatrix (x1, y1, x2, y2) means all the elements (x, y) satisfying x1 
x  x2 and y1  x  y2. It is guaranteed that 1  x1  x2  r, 1  y1  y2  c. After any operation,
the sum of all the elements in the matrix does not exceed 109.
```

## Input

```
There are several test cases. The first line of each case contains three positive integers r, c, m, where
m (1  m  20, 000) is the number of operations. Each of the next m lines contains a query. There
will be at most twenty rows in the matrix. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

```

## Output

```
For each type-3 query, print the summation, min and max.

```
