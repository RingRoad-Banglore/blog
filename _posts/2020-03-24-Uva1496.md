## Input

```text

Tao Yuanming(365-427) was a Chinese poet of Eastern Jin dy-
nasty. One of his most famous works is Peach Blossom Spring,
which is a fable about a chance discovery of an ethereal village
where the people lead an ideal existence in harmony with nature,
unaware of the outside world for centuries. So in Chinese, Peach
Blossom Spring means utopia.

In the story of Peach Blossom Spring, there was a myste-
rious place. In Qin dynasty, some people escaped to that place
during the civil unrest and built a village. They and their de-
scendants never left and never had any contact with the outside
world since then, until centuries latter a fisherman of Jin dynasty
found them.

Recently, some Chinese ACMers happened to find the relics
of the village mentioned inPeach Blossom Spring. They also
found a document about building hiding places to escape from
Qin army. The document said:

There were n houses and m roads in the village. Each
road connected two houses. These houses were numbered from
1 to n. There were k families, each living in a different
house. The houses they lived were house1, house2, . . . , housek. There were also k broken houses:
housenk+1, housenk+2, . . . , housen, with secret basements so that those houses could be used as hid-
ing places.

The problem was that all roads were broken. People wanted to repair some roads so that every
family could reach a hiding place through the repaired roads. Every hiding place could only hold one
family. Each road cost some labor to be repaired. The head of the village wanted to find out the
minimum cost way of repairing the roads, but he didnt know how to do.

Would you solve the problem which the ancient village head never solved?

the first line begins with three integers  the above mentioned n (4  n  50), m (0  m  1000) and
k (1  k  5, 2k  n). Then m lines follow, each containing three integers u,v and w, indicating that
there is a broken road connecting house u and v, and the cost to repair that road is w (1  w  1000).
