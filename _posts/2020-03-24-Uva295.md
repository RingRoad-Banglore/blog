title: Uva 00295  Fatman
---


## Input

```
Some of us may be so fortunate to be thin enough to squeeze through the tiniest hole, others are not.
Getting from A to B in a crowded supermarket (even without a cart) can be tough and may require
sophisticated navigation: there may seem to be enough room on the one side, but then you may run
into trouble with that lady further down...

Lets consider this in an abstract fashion: given an aisle of a certain width, with infinitely small
obstacles scattered around, just how fat can a person be and still be able to get from the left side
to the right side. Assume that seen from above a (fat) person looks like a circle and the person is
incompressible (a person with diameter d cannot go between two obstacles having distance less than
d).
```

## Output

```
The first line of input specifies the number of test cases your program has to process. The input for
each test case consists of the following lines:

 One line with the integer length L (0  L  100) and integer width W (0  W  100) of the
aisle, separated by a single space.

 One line with the number of obstacles N (0  N  100) in the aisle.

 N lines, one for each obstacle, with its integer coordinates X and Y (0  X  L, 0  Y  W )
separated by a single space.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case given in the input, print a line saying Maximum size in test case N is M.,
where M is rounded to the nearest fractional part of exactly four digits. M is the maximum diameter
of a person that can get through the aisle specified for that test case. N is the current test case number,
starting at one.
Note: The Sample Input looks like the picture on the right.
