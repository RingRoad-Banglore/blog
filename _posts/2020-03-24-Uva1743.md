Figure H.1: The judges wooden puzzle.

During last years ACM ICPC World Finals in Mar-
rakesh, one of the judges bought a pretty wooden
puzzle depicting a camel and palm trees (see Figure
H.1). Unlike traditional jigsaw puzzles, which are
usually created by cutting up an existing rectangu-
lar picture, all the pieces of this puzzle have been cut
and painted separately. As a result, adjacent pieces
often do not share common picture elements or col-
ors. Moreover, the resulting picture itself is irregu-
larly shaped. Given these properties, the shape of
individual pieces is often the only possible way to tell
where each piece should be placed.

The judge has been wondering ever since last year
whether it is possible to write a program to solve
this puzzle. An important part of such a program
is a method to evaluate how well two puzzle pieces
match each other. The better the match, the more
likely it is that those pieces are adjacent in the puzzle.

Pieces are modeled as simple polygons. Your task is to find a placement of two given polygons such
that their interiors do not overlap but the polygons touch with their boundaries and the length of the
common boundary is maximized. For this placement, polygons can be translated and rotated, but not
reflected or resized. Figure H.2 illustrates the optimal placement for Sample Input 1.

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The input contains the description of two polygons, one after the other. Each polygon description
starts with a line containing an integer n (3  n  50) denoting the number of vertices of the polygon.
This is followed by n lines, each containing two integer coordinates x, y of a polygon vertex (|x|, |y| 
100). The vertices of each polygon are given in clockwise order, and no three consecutive vertices are
collinear.

The input data is chosen so that even if the vertices were moved by a distance of up to 107, the
answer would not increase by more than 104.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, display the maximum possible length of the common boundary of these polygons
when they are optimally placed on a line by itself.

Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of less than 103.
