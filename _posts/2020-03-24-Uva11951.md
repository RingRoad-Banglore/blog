Steve has a dream to move from dormitory where we live now to a private house. He has already earned
some money by solving various problems and now wants to make a first move towards his dream. Steve
is going to buy a plot for his future house. However, due to high tax rate, he is going to buy only one
plot. Certainly Steve wants to maximize its area for the amount of money he owns (and if there are
several plots of same area, Steve certainly chooses a cheaper one). Can you help Steve?

The whole district where Steve wants to reside is divided into N  M equal strips. Each strip is
sold separately, for its own price Pi,j . According to the country law, plot is defined as a rectangular
collection of strips with sides parallel to the district.
