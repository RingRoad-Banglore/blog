title: Uva 12397  Roman Numerals
---


```
We would like to build Roman numerals with matches. As you know, Roman numerals are based on
the following seven characters: I, V, X, L, C, D, M.

Here we introduce the LUSIVERS font, in which the respective characters look like this:

Write a program that counts the number of matches used to build Roman numerals in the
LUSIVERS font. This number is exactly the total number of match heads in the characters. For
instance, to make the number 14 (=XIV), five matches are used.

You must follow the standard modern Roman numerals (as shown on the Wikipedia page). Ex-
pressions like IC or IIII are not allowed.
