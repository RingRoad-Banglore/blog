---


```
n people board an airplane with n seats. The first passenger has lost his boarding pass, so he sits
in a random seat. Each subsequent passenger sits in his own seat if its available or takes a random
unoccupied seat if its not.

Whats the probability that the nth passenger finds his seat occupied?
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case is described with one integer n on a single line
(2  n  1000).

The last line contains a single 0 and should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the probability that the n-th passenger finds his seat occupied on a single
line.

If the probability is 0, output 0/1. Otherwise, the probability should be expressed as an irreducible
fraction a/b, where a and b are positive integers and a and b be are relatively prime. Do not print any
spaces between the numbers or the division sign.
