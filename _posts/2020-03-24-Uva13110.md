## Input

```text
Little Arya wants a lot of fun, thats why she is visiting Playland today. Playland is a very particular
adventure park formed by N different attractions. Playland classifies its attractions in categories
(roller coaster, terror, aquatic, extreme, ... ) and each attraction belongs at least one and at most two
categories. Each Playlands attraction works with a ticket system, if you want to use an attraction you
must give a ticket from one of the categories this attraction belongs to, when you leave the attraction
you will receive a ticket from other category the attraction belongs to (different from the one you gave
when entering) or from the same category if the attraction belongs only to one.

To begin the adventure Arya must choose one ticket that allows her entry in the attraction that she
choose, after that she must follow the ticket exchange rule explained above. Arya is a girl with lot of
energy and she wants to enjoy all the attractions of Playland but without repeating any (that would
be consider boring and Arya just wanna have fun), but it is a very difficult choice.

For example, suppose there are 4 attractions in Playland, numbered from 0 to 3. Attraction 0
belongs to the categories roller coaster and aquatic; attraction 1 belongs only to roller coaster, attraction
2 belongs to aquatic and extreme and attraction 3 belongs to terror and roller coaster. If Arya starts
her adventure in the attraction 0 she can enter with the roller coaster or aquatic ticket and will receive
the other when she leave the attraction. If she choose the roller coaster ticket then she will receive
an aquatic ticket and only can entry in attraction 2, when she leaves attraction 2 she will receive
an extreme ticket and cant go to any other attraction. If she had chosen the aquatic ticket at the
beginning she would receive a roller coaster ticket and then she could go to attraction 1 or 3. If she
chooses attraction 3 when she leaves she will receive a terror ticket and again cant go anywhere else.
If she chooses attraction 1 she will receive a roller coaster ticket again when leaving and can only go to
attraction 3 but she will never go to attraction 2 this way. It isnt possible to visit all the attractions
starting at attraction 0. However, it is possible to start in attraction 2 with a terror ticket, leaving
with an aquatic ticket, then visit attraction 0 leaving with a roller coaster ticket, visit attraction 1 and
leaving again with roller coaster ticket and, at last, visit attraction 3.

As you can see, choose the attraction where the adventure must starts is not an easy choice, thats
why Arya needs your help to know if it is possible to choose an attraction to start such that she can
visit all attractions from Playland only once. Can you help Arya?

category starts with one integer K (0  K  N) and then K integers representing the attractions who
belongs to this category. All integers are separated by single spaces and the attractions are numbered
from 0 to N  1. Each attraction will appear at least once and at most twice and no attraction will be
