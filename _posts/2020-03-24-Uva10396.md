title: Uva 10396  Vampire Numbers
---


```
A number v = x  y with an even number (n) of digits formed by multiplying a pair of n/2-digit
numbers (where the digits are taken from the original number in any order) x and y together is known
as vampire number. Pairs of trailing zeros (both the numbers have a trailing zero) are not allowed. If
v is a vampire number then x and y are called its fangs.

Examples of 4-digit vampire numbers include

1) 21 60 = 1260
2) 15 93 = 1395
3) 35 41 = 1435
4) 30 51 = 1530
5) 21 87 = 1827
6) 27 81 = 2187
7) 80 86 = 6880

In this program you will have to find all the 4, 6 and 8 digit even vampire numbers.
