```
A number v = x  y with an even number (n) of digits formed by multiplying a pair of n/2-digit
numbers (where the digits are taken from the original number in any order) x and y together is known
as vampire number. Pairs of trailing zeros (both the numbers have a trailing zero) are not allowed. If
v is a vampire number then x and y are called its fangs.
