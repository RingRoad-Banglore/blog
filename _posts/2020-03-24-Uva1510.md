title: Uva 01510  Neon Sign
---


```

JungHeum recently opened a restaurant called Triangle and has ordered the following neon sign for his
restaurant. The neon sign has N corners positioned on the circumference of a circle, and N  (N  1)/2
luminous tubes that connect the corners. There are only two colors for luminous tubes, red and blue.

JungHeum wants the sign to show only one shape of a triangle at a time, whose luminous tubes
colors are same, continuously. Hence, he wants to know the number of uni-color triangles.

For example, the following neon sign has only two uni-color triangles (1, 3, 5) and (2, 3, 4).

Given the number of corners of the neon sign and the colors of the luminous tubes in the sign, write
a program that finds the number of uni-color triangles.
```

## Input

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with an integer N (3  N  1, 000),
which represents the number of corners of the neon sign. In the following N  1 lines, the information
about the color of the luminous tubes are given. For the i-th line of these lines, the color information
of the luminous tubes that connect corner i to corners from corner i+ 1 to N are given. Note that the
color red is represented as 1 and the color blue is represented as 0.

```

## Output

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should
contain the number of uni-color triangles.

The following shows sample input and output for two test cases.
