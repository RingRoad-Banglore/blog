## Input

```text
Kamran is preparing for his term final examinations. He understands all the algorithms in the syllabus
and expects creative a question in the examination hall. But when he looks at a question paper of
previous year he realizes that he is expecting too much. It is full of questions like Write the pseudo
code of Matrix Chain Multiplication Algorithm., Write the pseudo code of BFS algorithm. all of
which can be answered with the help of memorization (Not memoization). In almost all his courses
Commit to Memory and Vomit to Exam Sheet is the ultimate method of getting good marks. The
fact is clear and simple that one cannot expect creative questions from people who are not creative at
all. This lack of creativity is evident in his countrys poor status in Science & Technology field. His
mind gets lost for some time in the past when he dreamt of learning wonderful things while studying
in the so-called best science & technology university of his country and then he comes back again to
the bitter present, lost in his clerical study-materials.

Kamran has a very simple but uncommon (I mean cannot just be copied from pages of your book)
problem for you. Can you prove by solving it that you are not one of those who only memorize pseudo
codes before algorithm exam? The problem is stated below:

A general equation of second degree with two variables is ax2 + by2 + cxy + dx + ey + f = 0, You
can see that it has six terms on the left hand side (LHS). A general equation of second degree with
two variables and with only terms of even degree is ax2 + by2 + cxy + d = 0, which has only four
terms in LHS. A general equation of third degree with two variables with only terms of odd degree is
ax3 + by3 + cx2y + dxy2 + ex + fy = 0, which has only six terms in LHS. Given the degree (n) and
number of variables (v) your job is

a) If n is even you should determine the number of terms in a general equation of n-degree with v
variables and only with terms of even degree OR

b) If n is odd you should determine the number of terms in a general equation of n-degree with v
variables and only with terms of odd degree.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 5000 lines of input. Each line contains two integers n (0  n  1000)
and v (0 < v  1000). Input is terminated by a case whose value of n and v is zero. This case must
not be processed. The meaning of n and v is given in the problem statement.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains one integer T that indicates the
number of terms on the left hand side of a general equation of degree n, v variables and only of odd
degree terms when n is odd or only of even degree terms when n is even. You can assume that the
input will be such that output will always fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
