```
The famous Glenbow Museum in Calgary is Western Canadas largest museum, with exhibits ranging
from art to cultural history to mineralogy. A brand new section is being planned, devoted to brilliant
computer programmers just like you. Unfortunately, due to lack of space, the museum is going to have
to build a brand new building and relocate into it.

The size and capacity of the new building differ from those of the original building. But the
floor plans of both buildings are orthogonal polygons. An orthogonal polygon is a polygon whose
internal angles are either 90 or 270. If 90 angles are denoted as R (Right) and 270 angles are
denoted as O (Obtuse) then a string containing only R and O can roughly describe an orthogonal
polygon. For example, a rectangle (Figure 1) is the simplest orthogonal polygon and it can be described
as RRRR (the angles are listed in counter-clockwise order, starting from any corner). Similarly, a
cross-shaped orthogonal polygon (Figure 2) can be described by the sequence RRORRORRORRO,
RORRORRORROR, or ORRORRORRORR. These sequences are called angle strings.

Of course, an angle string does not completely specify the shape of a polygon  it says nothing
about the length of the sides. And some angle strings cannot possibly describe a valid orthogonal
polygon (RRROR, for example).

To complicate things further, not all orthogonal polygons are acceptable floor plans for the mu-
seum. A museum contains many valuable objects, and these objects must be guarded. Due to cost
considerations, no floor can have more than one guard. So a floor plan is acceptable only if there is
a place within the floor from which one guard can see the entire floor. Similarly, an angle string is
acceptable only if it describes at least one acceptable polygon. Note that the cross-shaped polygon in
Figure 2 can be guarded by someone standing in the center, so it is acceptable. Thus the angle string
RRORRORRORRO is acceptable, even though it also describes other polygons that cannot be properly
guarded by a single guard.

Help the designers of the new building determine how many acceptable angle strings there are of a
given length.

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing a positive integer L
(1  L  1000), which is the desired length of an angle string. The input will end with a line containing
a single zero.
