## Input

```text
In the current business world there are many situations of participation of a company in the capital of
another, of cross-participations and of partnerships. The amount of capital owned by each participant
determines the number of votes. An entity possessing 50%+1 votes controls the company. This entity
may be a single company or a partnership of several companies. To make the process more complex,
a company may control another indirectly, because if company A controls company B, and B controls
C, then A controls C. Thus it is not always clear who controls what.

In order to understand the power relationships among companies, a knowledgeable stock exchange
broker writes down some facts of the form A > B, meaning company A controls company B. He
also writes more generic facts like A1 . . . An > B meaning that a possible partnership of companies
A1 . . . An is able to control B. Due to the empiric process used, the set of facts may include many
redundancies, of two types:

Type 1: if A B C > D is a fact but it can be concluded from the set of facts that A and B together are
enough to control D (directly or indirectly), then C can be deleted from the former fact because
it is irrelevant.

Type 2: if there is a fact A > B but it can be concluded just from the other facts that A controls B,
then A > B may be deleted because it is redundant.

To get a clearer picture of the essential relationships, an analyst would like to have a minimal version
of the set of facts without redundancies, but also without loosing information. There may be several
alternative minimal sets of facts.

Given an initial set of facts of the form A1 . . . An > B a minimal set is an equivalent set that
contains neither redundancies of type 1 nor of type 2. Which is the number of facts of the smallest
minimal set?
