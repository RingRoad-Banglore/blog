## Input

```
Are you ready to have a sweet dream? OK! Close your eyes (Hey! Do NOT! I was kidding! How can
you read the problem statement with your eyes closed? Umm! Let me think . . . Yes! There is a good
solution to this problem. Simply, hand this paper to your teammate and let him read it aloud for you)!

. . . You are standing in the middle of a room and you have a handful of discs of different sizes. They
are heavy. You somehow feel uncomfortable. Calm down and dont worry! I am going to help you feel
comfortable again. Simply choose one of the discs in your hand randomly and drop it on the floor. Yes!
You feel a little more comfortable. Choose and drop another! Then another one! . . . And continue this
process until your hands are empty. Now, you are as light as a feather and you are ready to fly away
. . .

Figure 1. A Room containing a Rotating
Door

But dont be so quick! Before flying away, you should
solve a problem. Open your eyes and take a look at the
floor. You see the discs youve just dropped (To the team-
mate reading this problem aloud: Show the contents of
figure 1 to your teammate who is going to open his eyes
now).

You can see that some discs are partially (or totally)
covered by other discs. Your job is to compute the total
perimeter of parts of the discs that you can see from the
above.

Umm! I think you feel a little bit uncomfortable again.
Am I right?
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains a single integer T  100 which is the number of test cases. Each test
case starts with a single integer N  100, the number of discs originally in your hand followed by N
lines, the kth of which containing three floating-point numbers which are rk  100, 000, radius of the
kth disc and 100, 000  xk, yk  100, 000 the coordinates of the point on the floor on which the disc
has fallen. Two floating-point numbers are assumed to be equal if their absolute difference is less than
1010

```

## Sample Input

```
Output for each test case consists of a line containing a floating-point number which is the total
perimeter of part of discs that can be seen from above rounded to 3 decimal digits after the fraction
point. The number should have exactly 3 digits after the fraction point.
