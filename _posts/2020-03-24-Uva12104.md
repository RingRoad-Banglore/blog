title: Uva 12104  A Rod in a Path
---


## Input

```text

Fig 1. The grid, the path and the rod

Alice has a rod. One day, she draws a path on a grid and
puts the rod on it. The path begins at (0, 0) and continues
to the right. The first and last segments are always hor-
izontal, so there are always an odd number of segments.
If we number the segments 1, 2, . . . , n, odd-numbered seg-
ments are all horizontal, while other segments (if any) are
vertical. Initially, one endpoint B of the rod is located at
(0, 0), and the other endpoint A is at (L, 0), where L is the
length of the rod. The length of the first segment is at least
L.

When moving the rod, both endpoints A and B must
be always on the path, though other parts may be outside.
The rod is hard, so its length (i.e. distance between A and
B) is always L.

Write a program to compute the minimum distance A must cover to reach the rightmost endpoint
of the path.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains two integers n and L
(1  n  10, 1  L  30), described above. The second line contains n non-zero integers li (30  li 
30), the lengths and directions of path segments. The absolute value of li denotes length of the i-th
segment. If it is horizontal, li is positive. That means, horizontal segments are always left-to-right. If it
is vertical, positive means down-to-up (increasing y coordinate), negative means up-to-down (decreasing
y coordinate). The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and the minimum distance to two decimal places. If its not
possible to reach the rightmost point, print -1.
