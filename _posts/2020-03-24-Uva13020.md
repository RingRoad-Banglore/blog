```
Preparations for a good harvest in Spring start now and farmer John is preparing his field for a good
season. He went over-budget last year, as the tractors moving up and down the hills needed more fuel
than he expected.

When harvesting, his tractors need to move both horizontally
and vertically across all the land. In the image, you can see a
region at low altitude in light green and a region at high altitude
in dark green. When harvesting, his tractors will have to cross
all the hills marked in red and they will have to go up or down 8
times.

This year, he is wondering whether he should level some parts
of his field before sowing in order to lower his harvesting costs
later on. Can you help him decide where the bulldozers should
work in order to lower his costs?

Farmer John knows that his tractors need A additional eu-
ros when moving between adjacent patches of land at different
heights. He can also pay B euros to either increase or decrease
the height of any patch in his field.

What is the minimum amount of money he will have to pay this season?
Given a description of the field, the price to change the height of a patch of land and the price his

tractors pay when moving between adjacent patches, the goal is to find out the minimum amount that
farmer John will have to pay this year.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line consists of 4 space separated integers, N , M , A and B. N and M represent the
dimensions of his N  M field, A represents the cost to move between adjacent patches of land at
different levels and B is the cost to change any patch of land.

The next N lines each have M characters and represent farmer Johns field. A . signals a patch of
land at a low level and a # represents a patch of land at a high level.
Constraints:

1  N,M  50 Size of the field.
1  A,B  100 000 Cost to change any height or to move between adjacent patches.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, you should output a single line with a single integer representing the minimum
amount of money that farmer John will have to pay.
Sample explanation:

Farmer John has a 5 4 field. Moving between adjacent patches at a different level requires e1000
in fuel, while changing the height of a patch costs e2000.

Farmer John needs e11000: e2000 to change the isolated patch to a lower level and e9000 for the
fuel needed to move between patches of land at different levels.

Not changing any patch would cost him e12000, changing all the high patches to low would cost
him e18000, and changing all the low patches to high would cost him e22000.
