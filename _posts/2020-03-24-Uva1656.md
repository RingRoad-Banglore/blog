title: Uva 01656  Exponential Towers
---


## Input

```text

The number 729 can be written as a power in several ways: 36, 93 and 272. It can be written as 7291, of
course, but that does not count as a power. We want to go some steps further. To do so, it is convenient
to use ^ for exponentiation, so we define a^b = ab. The number 256 then can be also written as 2^2^3,
or as 4^2^2. Recall that ^ is right associative, so 2^2^3 means 2^(2^3).

We define a tower of powers of height k to be an expression of the form a1^a2^a3^ . . . ^ak, with
k >1, and integers ai > 1.

Given a tower of powers of height 3, representing some integer n, how many towers of powers of
height at least 3 represent n?
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each on a separate line. Each test case has the form a^b^c,
where a, b and c are integers, 1 < a, b, c  9585.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the number of ways the number n = a^b^c can be represented as a tower of
powers of height at least three.

The magic number 9585 is carefully chosen such that the output is always less than 263.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4^2^2

8^12^2

8192^8192^8192

2^900^576
