title: Uva 10002  Center of Masses
---


```
Find out the center of masses of a convex polygon.
```

## Input

```
A series of convex polygons, defined as a number n (n  100) stating the number of points of the polygon,
followed by n different pairs of integers (in no particular order), denoting the x and y coordinates of
each point. The input is finished by a fake polygon with m (m < 3) points, which should not be
processed. No three points are aligned in any polygon.

```

## Output

```
For each polygon, a single line with the coordinates x and y of the center of masses of that polygon,
rounded to three decimal digits.

```
