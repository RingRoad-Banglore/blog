title: Uva 12552  The Moon of Valencia
---


## Input

```

It is well known that the Moon of Valencia is magical. Everyone talks about a mystery that happens
at night. People remember what time they entered the first bar, what time arrived to the hotel and
how happy they arrived, but nobody remembers the bars and pubs they visited.

The Valencia hotels have hired you for developing an application that helps customers to remember.
The application will inform customers with one of all the possible sequences of bars and pubs. Customers
have to provide the following information: departure time and place, arrival time and place, and degree
of satisfaction on arrival.

The application uses a map with the location of each bar or pub. Each bar or pub produces a
different degree of satisfaction when visited. But people gets angry when walks from one place to
another, thats the reason why walking between different places reduces the degree of satisfaction. The
reduction considered depends on the amount of minutes people needs to get one place from another
one. If the amount of minutes is not an integer the remaining seconds should be considered a portion
of a minute, i.e., 30 seconds imply 0.5 minutes. People walk at a speed of 4 km/h, can stay in a bar
or pub the time they like, but for getting the satisfaction must remain at least 15 minutes. People can
decide not to visit a bar or pub, i.e., they can use a path from the origin to the target and to enter in a
subset of all the bars or pubs reachable with the path. Entering to the departure place is optional, like
entering others places. The goal grade of satisfaction is computed up to the door of the target place,
without entering it. So the grade of satisfaction of the target place (bar, pub or hotel) should not be
computed.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several test cases. Each case begins with the map description, which is followed by
the list of arrivals your application have to check. The description of a map begins with the word MAP
in capital letters followed by two integer numbers, P and M , where P is the number of places and M
is the number of paths connecting two places. (1  P  64). Places and paths are described one per
line. Each place is described with two coordinates (real numbers represent kilometers), its grade of
satisfaction (a real number), the ID and the name. The paths connecting two places are identified by
the their identifiers. Each pair of places can only be connected by one path.

Figure 1 shows the map corresponding to the first map in the example input case. It is guaranteed
that no crossing paths exist.

The list of arrivals to be processed begins after a line with the word ARRIVALS in uppercase. Each
arrival is described in a single line, including departure time, departure place, arrival time, arrival place
and the grade of satisfaction on arrival, a real number.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output for each case must begin with the word MAP in capital letters followed by anumber indicating
the number of test case. The first test case is MAP 1, second is MAP 2, and so on. For each arrival
proposed in the input it must appear a line in the output specifying a valid path found or the string
Impossible! indicating that it is not possible to find a path from origin to target with the required
grade of satisfaction. A path found will be valid if the absolute difference between the required grade
of satisfaction and the obtained one is less than 0.1, and contains no loops, i.e. a place cant appear in
the path found more than once.

Figure 1: Representation of the first map in the input example.

Each path found must begin with the string PATH FOUND: in capital letters, followed by the obtained
grade of satisfaction with three decimal digits and then the sequence of places from origin up to target.
The ID of the unvisited places must appear preceded by the ! sign. Noticeas the ID of the target
place never is preceded by this sign.

Hint: Set up your solution for running as fast as possible by using this example, it should be enough
for all test cases.
