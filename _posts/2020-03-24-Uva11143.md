Babi likes to see movies every week and he assigns a specific time of each week to watch new movies
received during that week. Recently, he has received some new movies in divx format after a long
period of time without any new movie! however, all the movies has foreign languages (something
except Farsi), so that he tried to download appropriate subtitles of these films. After he downloaded
and got disconnected from Internet, he found out that some of the subtitles, which he has downloaded,
are not for theare not for the his distribution of the video files. After careful consideration of subtitles,
he noticed that the differences may occur in one of the cases below:

 The number of CDs that the subtitle is written for, is different from the number of Babis video
CDs.

 The duration of beginning advertisements in the distribution, which the subtitle is written for, is
different from the advertisement duration of Babis video.

 Some scenes are censored in the Babis video.

Since Babi prefers to change the current subtitles to match his videos instead of searching for new
subtitles, he needs your help to write a program with the following features to manipulate a subtitle:

 Merge n subtitles into one subtitle and/or divide a subtitle into m subtitles.

 Shift a subtitle t seconds backward or forward.

 Cutting a specific period of time from a subtitle.

For those who are not familiar with the format of a regular subtitle file, here is a description of
.srt format. Every .srt subtitle is a text file containing some individual text blocks in the following
format:

BlockIndex
StartT ime --> FinishT ime
< Sentence 1 >
< Sentence 2 >
. . .
< Sentence sn >

where BlockIndex shows this block is the BlockIndex-th block of the text file, StartT ime is the
time in which all sentences of this block must be shown and FinishT ime is the time the sentences
should disappear, all time descriptions are in the format hh:mm:ss,msmsms (e.g. 01:20:01,630 or
99:59:59,999). Each block can have 0 < sn  5 sentences that should be shown in the specified period.
It should be noted that these sentences have at most 80 characters.

All blocks of the movie comes sequentially sorted in increasing order of their start time and the
display period of two different blocks are disjoint. Also, the blocks are separated by a blank line. (See
the sample input for an example)

## Input

```
Input has several test cases. Each test case starts with the description of Babis video file. First, the
number of CDs, which Babis video has, 0 < bcdn < 6, come in a line. Next, bcdn time descriptions come
each in a separate line denoting duration of each CD. Next line contains a time description showing the
duration of Advertisement in the beginning of first CD. After that, a line containing an integer cn < 100
come denoting the number of censored parts in the Babis video, and then, there are cn lines where
i-th line contains two time descriptions, which show the begin and the end of the i-th censored part.

Next, the descriptions of subtitle files come, which starts with a single number 0 < scdn < 6,
denoting number of subtitle files. Then, scdn time descriptions each in a separate line come denoting
duration of each subtitle file, then a time description comes, which is the duration of advertisement in
the beginning of first CD of distribution of video, which the subtitle is written for. Finally, the contents
of scdn subtitle files come in the above .srt format. There is a blank line after each block of test cases.

Note 1. For the simplicity of reading, end of each subtitle file is marked with a Block index 0, but
you should know the subtitle files do not contain this 0 at the end, consequently in the output your
program should not print this number at the end of each subtitle file .

Note 2. There exist at most 1000 blocks in every subtitle file.
Note 3. The time description of censored parts are given for the distribution of video whose subtitles

are downloaded by Babi.
Note 4. There is no subtitle block in the duration of advertisement.
Note 5. The interval of censored parts are disjoint.
Note 6. All milliseconds between first and last time of a censored part interval including first and

last millisecond should be deleted from subtitles. For example, a censored part from 00:00:00:001 to
00:00:00:004 cuts the mathematical interval [00:00:00:001,00:00:00:005).

Note 7. Two blocks of subtitles are called equal if they have exactly the same sentences. Two
blocks of subtitles are called joint if the there is not any time between finishing time of one of them
and starting time of the other one. All equal joint blocks must be merged into one block.

Note 8. All inputs are guaranteed to be valid.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, your program must output the contents of bcdn subtitles suitable for Babis video.

Print out a blank line after each of these bcdn subtitle files, and also, after output of each test case.
