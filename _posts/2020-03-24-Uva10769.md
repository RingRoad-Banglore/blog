title: Uva 10769  Pillars
---


```
The world-famous architect Mr. Fru from Reus plans to build a colossal pillar H units high. Mr. Fru
has n black pieces with heights b1, . . . , bn and m white pieces with heights w1, . . . , wm. According to
his design the pillar must have four pieces: a black piece on its bottom, a white piece above it, another
black piece above, and finally a white piece on the top of the pillar.

Mr. Fru wishes to know which of the combinations of four pieces with total height H is the most
stable. Given two combinations A = [a1, a2, a3, a4] and B = [b1, b2, b3, b4] (where a1 denotes the height
of the bottom (black) piece of the pillar A, a2 denotes the height of the second (white) piece of A, and
so on), A is more stable than B if a1 > b1, or if a1 = b1 but a2 > b2, etc. (In other words, A is more
stable than B if and only if the sequence of heights of the pieces of A is lexicographically larger than
the sequence of heights of the pieces of B.)

Write a program such that, given the desired height H of the pillar, the heights of the black pieces
and the heights of the white pieces, computes which pillar (if any) of height exactly H would be the
most stable.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of zero ore more test cases. Each test case has on the first line H, an integer between
1 and 4  108. The second and third lines of each test consist respectively of the sequence b1, . . . , bn
and of the sequence w1, . . . , wm. A blank line separates two consecutive test cases. You can assume
2  n  100 and 2  m  100, and that no piece has a height larger than 108.

```

## Output

```
For every test case, print one line with the sequence of heights of the pieces of the most stable pillar.
If no solution exists, print no solution.
