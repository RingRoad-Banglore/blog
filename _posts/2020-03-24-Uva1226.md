## Input

```

We suspect that for every positive integer N there exists an integer of the form 11 . . . 10 . . . 0 (a sequence
of 1s followed by 0 or more 0s) that is divisible by N . For example, with N = 3, 111 is divisible by 3,
with N = 4, 100 is divisible by 4, with N = 7, 11111 is divisible by 7. We want to verify this for some
integers. The solution to this problem is to find two different numbers P and Q in the form of 11 . . . 1
(a sequence of 1s) that have the same remainder when dividing by N . The difference D between P
and Q will be in the form of 11 . . . 10 . . . 0 and divisible by N .

In order to solve this problem, we have to start with finding the remainder when dividing a number
in the form of 11 . . . 1 by N . Your task is to write a program to do this.

## Output

```
The input file consists of several data sets. The first line of the input file contains the number of data
sets which is a positive integer and is not bigger than 20. The following lines describe the data sets.

Each data set is described by two lines. The first line contains the integer N (1 < N < 109). The
second line contains the integer number P (P contains at least one digit and at most 2000 digits).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, write in one line the remainder when dividing P by N .
