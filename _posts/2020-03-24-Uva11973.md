title: Uva 11973  Sierpinski Carpet
---


```
The Sierpinski carpet is a typical plane fractal. The construction of it begins with a square. The square
is cut into 9 congruent subsquares in a 3-by-3 grid, and the central subsquare is removed. The same
procedure is then applied recursively to the remaining 8 subsquares, ad infinitum.

Lets call the first figure (single square) from which we begin carpet construction S0, next figure
(combined 8 squares) S1, S2 figure is combined of 64 squares and so on.

Here is an example of full Sierpinski carpet (S):

In this problem you will be given a point in the plain and you have to find the maximal figure SN to
which this point still belongs.
```

## Input

```
The number of tests T (T  100) is given on the first line. Each of next T lines contains two floating
point numbers cordinates X (0 < X < 1) and Y (0 < Y < 1) of a given point. Points cordinates are
given with maximal precision of 6 digits after decimal point.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output a single line Case T: N . Where T is the test case number (starting from
1) and N is the maximal index of figure S that point still belongs to. If point is in Sierpinski Carpet
itself (S) then N must be equal to -1.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
0.111 0.111
0.123 0.123

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 10
Case 2: 1
```
