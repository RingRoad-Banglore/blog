title: Uva 12102  Linelands Airport

## Input

```text

Lineland is a strange country. As the name suggests, its shape (as seen from above) is just a straight
line, rather than some two-dimensional shape. The landscape along this line is very mountainous,
something which occasionally leads to some problems. One such problem now occurs: in this modern
era the king wants to build an airport to stimulate the countrys economy. Unfortunately, its impossible
for airplanes to land on steep airstrips, so a horizontal piece of land is needed. To accommodate for the
larger airplanes, this strip needs to have length at least L.

Over the years, the inhabitants of Lineland have become very proficient in attening pieces of land.
Given a piece a land, they can remove rock quickly. They dont want to add rock for that may lead to
an unstable landing strip. To minimize the amount of effort, however, they want to remove the least
amount of rock necessary to reach their goal: a at piece of land of length L. What is this minimum
amount? Because of the low-dimensional nature of Lineland, the amount of rock that needs to be
removed is measured as the total area of land above the place where the landing strip is placed, rather
than the volume (so in the Figure below, the amount of land removed is given by the lightly shaded
area).

## Output

```text
One line with a positive number: the number of test cases (at most 25). Then for each test case:

 One line with an integer N , 2  N  500, the number of points, and an integer L, 1  L  10000,
the necessary length to atten.

 N lines with two integers xi and yi with 0  xi, yi  10000 describing the landscape of Lineland.
The xi are in (strictly) ascending order. At position xi the height of the landscape is yi. Between
two xi the landscape has constant slope. (So the landscape is piecewise linear). The difference
between xN and x1 is greater than or equal to L.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line with the minimum amount of rock which must be removed in order
to build the airport. The answer should be given as a oating point number with an absolute error of at
most 103.
