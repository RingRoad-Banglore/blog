## Input

```

Figure 1: The figure above corresponds to the first sample input.
The dashed rectangle shows the subgrid (1, 1, 2, 2). If we move
all the marbles of this subgrid to cell (2, 2) the total cost will be
(1  2+2  1+5  1+6  0) = 9. And this is the minimum possible
cost, because the cost of moving all the marbles to (1, 1), (1, 2)
and (2, 1) is 19, 17 and 11 respectively. This example corresponds
to the second query of first sample input.

There is a grid of r rows and c
columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to r and the columns are
numbered from 1 to c. The upper
left cell is in row 1 and column 1.
The lower right cell is in row r and
column c. A cell (p, q) denotes the
cell in row p and column q in the
grid. A subgrid (r1, c1, r2, c2) is a
part of the grid that contains all the
cells from rows r1 to r2 and columns
c1 to c2 (inclusive). In one unit of
time you can move one marble from
the cell (p, q) to any of the following
4 cells: cell(p  1, q), cell(p + 1, q),
cell(p, q1), cell(p, q+1). You will
be given the information of a grid.
Then you will be given some sub-
grids. For each subgrid your task is
to calculate the minimum amount
of time needed to move all the mar-
bles to any of the cells in that sub
grid.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains an integer T (T  3) the number of test cases. Each of the test cases
begins with three integers r, c (1  r, c  500) and q (0  q  10000) in one line. Here r is the number
of rows, c is the number of columns and q is the number of queries. Each of the next r lines contains
c integers. The jth integer in the ith line contains the number of marbles in the cell(i, j). All these
numbers are non- negative and less than 1001. Each of the next q lines contains 4 integers: r1, c1, r2,
c2. These 4 integers denote the sub grid (r1, c1, r2, c2). You can obviously assume that (1  r1, r2  r
and 1  c1, c2  c)

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case you have to produce q + 1 lines of output. The description of output for each test
case is given below:

First line of each test case contains the serial of that test case. Each of the next q line contains
output for one query of that test case. Output for each query contains two integers separated by a single
space. The first integer denotes the serial of the query and the second integer denotes the minimum
time required to move the marbles within the query subgrid to one of the cells within the subgrid.

Print a blank line after each test case.
