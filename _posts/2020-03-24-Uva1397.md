## Input

```

One of the tasks students routinely carry out in their mathematics classes is to solve a polynomial
equation. It is, given a polynomial, say X2  4X + 1, to find its roots (2


3).

If the students task is to find the roots of a given polynomial, the teachers task is then to find a
polynomial that has a given root. Ms. Galsone is an enthusiastic mathematics teacher who is bored
with finding solutions of quadratic equations that are as simple as a+b


c. She wanted to make higher-

degree equations whose solutions are a little more complicated. As usual in problems in mathematics
classes, she wants to maintain all coefficients to be integers and keep the degree of the polynomial as
small as possible (provided it has the specified root). Please help her by writing a program that carries
out the task of the teachers side.

You are given a number t of the form:

t = m

a+

n

b

where a and b are distinct prime numbers, and m and n are integers greater than 1.
In this problem, you are asked to find ts minimal polynomial on integers, which is the polynomial

F (X) = adX
d + ad1X

d1 +   + a1X + a0 satisfying the following conditions.

1. Coefficients a0, . . . , ad are integers and ad > 0.

2. F (t) = 0.

3. The degree d is minimum among polynomials satisfying the above two conditions.

4. F (X) is primitive. That is, coefficients a0, . . . , ad have no common divisors greater than one.

For example, the minimal polynomial of

3 +


2 on integers is F (X) = X4  10X2 + 1. Verifying

F (t) = 0 is as simple as the following ( =

3,  =


2).

F (t) = (+ )4  10(+ )2 + 1
= (4 + 43 + 622 + 43 + 4) 10(2 + 2 + 2) + 1
= 9 + 12 + 36 + 8 + 4 10(3 + 2 + 2) + 1
= (9 + 36 + 4 50 + 1) + (12 + 8 20)
= 0

Verifying that the degree of F (t) is in fact minimum is a bit more difficult. Fortunately, under the
condition given in this problem, which is that a and b are distinct prime numbers and m and n greater
than one, the degree of the minimal polynomial is always mn. Moreover, it is always monic. That is,
the coefficient of its highest-order term (ad) is one.

2. mn  20

3. The coefficients of the answer a0, . . . , ad are between (231 + 1) and (231  1), inclusive.

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset, output the coefficients of its minimal polynomial on integers F (X) = adX
d +

ad1X
d1 +   + a1X + a0, in the following format.

ad ad1 . . . a1 a0

Non-negative integers must be printed without a sign (+ or -). Numbers in a single line must be
separated by a single space and no other characters or extra spaces may appear in the output.
