title: Uva 00361  Cops and Robbers
---


## Input

```text
You are to simulate a game of Cops and Robbers. In this game, cops, robbers, and other citizens are
represented as points in a two-dimensional plane. A citizen is said to be safe if it is within a triangle
formed by three cops. A citizen is said to be robbed if it is not safe and is within a triangle formed by
three robbers. A citizen is neither safe nor robbed if it satisfies neither of the above conditions. For
purposes of this problem, a triangle consists of three points, and a point is within a triangle if it is
inside or on the boundary of the triangle.

In the following diagram, filled circles represent cops, filled squares represent robbers, and filled
triangles represent citizens. Dashed lines indicate triangles formed by cops or robbers

In this example, citizens A and B are safe, citizen C is robbed, and citizen D is neither.
Given a set of cops and robbers and several citizen queries, efficiently determine whether each

citizen is safe, robbed, or neither.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several data sets. The first line of each data set contains three non-negative
integers c, r, and o: the number of cops, robbers, and other citizens, respectively. c, r, and o will
each be at most 200. The next c lines contain the (x, y) coordinates of each cop, one per line. The
next r lines contain the (x, y) coordinates of each robber, one per line. The next o linescontain the
(x, y) coordinates of each other citizen, one per line. All coordinates are integers between -500 and 500
inclusive.

A blank line follows each data set. Your program must stop processing input when it encounters a
data set in which c, r, and o are all zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output for each data set begins with a line identifying the data set. For each other citizen in the data
set, output the line
Citizen at (x,y) is status.
where (x, y) is the location of the citizen from the input and status is one of safe, robbed or
neither. Follow the format given in the Sample Output. Leave a blank line after the output from
each data set.
Warning: When a citizen is between two cops (resp. robbers) or match one of them, it must be
considered safe (resp. robbed) if there is a 3rd cop (resp. robber) anywhere so that they form a
triangle.
