title: Uva 01313  Ghost Busters
---


## Input

```

The famous Ghost Busters team has decided to up-
grade their Ectomobile (aka Ecto-1) with a powerful
proton gun and an advanced targeting system. Egon
has designed and built all the hardware which consists
of ectoplasmic scanner and a proton gun that has two
degrees of freedom and can automatically rotate and
fire in a 90 degrees trihedral angle. You have been
hired to write a prototype for the targeting software.

Ghosts are detected by ectoplasmic scanner and
are represented as floating spheres. The coordinates
of their centers and radii are delivered from the ec-
toplasmic scanner to the targeting software. The co-
ordinate system is aligned is such a way, that the
proton gun fires from the point (0, 0, 0) anywhere
into X  0, Y  0, Z  0 trihedral angle. The gun
fires a proton ray in a straight line and is so powerful,
that even a touch of its ray is enough to kill a ghost.
The ray of the proton gun is able to kill a virtually
unlimited number of ghosts on its way.

For the first prototype for the targeting software,
you are asked to write a program that determines the maximal number of ghosts that can be killed
with a single shot of the proton gun.

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

On the first line of the input file there is a single integer number N (0  N  100) - the number of
ghosts detected by the ectoplasmic scanner of Ecto-1. The following N lines describe detected ghosts
- one ghost per line. The description of i-th ghost (ghosts are numbered from 1 to N) consists of 4
integer numbers Xi, Yi, Zi, and Ri, separated by spaces. Xi, Yi, Zi (1  Xi, Yi, Zi  10000) are the
coordinates of the ghosts center, and Ri (1  Ri  min(Xi, Yi, Zi)) is the ghosts radius. Because
ghosts are ectoplasmic, they can be arbitrarily placed in respect to each others. They can intersect, fit
inside each other, coincide with each other, etc.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

On the first line of the output file write a single integer number  the maximal number of ghosts
that can be killed with a single shot of the proton gun. On the second line of the output file write the
identifying numbers of the ghosts to be killed in an arbitrary order separated by spaces. If there are
multiple ways to kill this number of ghosts then write any one.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1313  Ghost Busters 2/2

Notes:

a) It is possible to kill both ghosts in the first sample only because the proton gun is so powerful
that it kills ghosts by mere touch.

b) The second sample has 11 more ghosts (for a total of 13). Picture shows the view of these ghosts
through the ectoplasmic scope sight that Egon has attached to proton gun to calibrate it and to
debug your targeting software. Outlines show ghosts as seen through the scope.
