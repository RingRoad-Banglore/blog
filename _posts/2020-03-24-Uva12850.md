Jennie and Maude skating

Two graceful skaters, Jennie and Maude, race each other along
a track one mile long. However, they start from opposite ends
of the track, and skate towards the others starting point. Be-
cause of a strong wind, Jennie receives an important advantage
that helps her fnish the race two and a half times as quick as
Maude. Maude fnished the race six minutes later. What was
the time of each of them skating the mile?

Assume that the race always happens in a track one mile
long, and that the skaters always maintain constant speeds.
Let vJ be Jennies speed, and vM Maudes speed. We will call
r the ratio between the two speedsthat is, r = vJvM . Let t be the time in minutes between the
moment when Jennie fnished the race and the moment when Maude did the same. Given the values r
and t, determine the time that each skater took to complete the race.

## Output

```text
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two real numbers: r and t, as described above. Each number will be
presented with two digits after the decimal point.

T  5000; 1 < r  10; 0 < t  30

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number, followed by two real numbers: the time in minutes of Jennie
and Maude to complete the race, in that order. Print these numbers with exactly three digits after the
decimal point.
