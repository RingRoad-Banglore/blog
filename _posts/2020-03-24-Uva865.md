Shar's Birthday:
The birthday is October 6th, but the party will be Saturday,
October 5. It's my 24th birthday and the first one in some
years for which I've been employed. Plus, I have new clothes.
So I have cause to celebrate. More importantly, though,
we've cleaned the house! The address is 506-D Albert Street.
Extra enticement for CS geeks: there are several systems in
the house, and the party is conveniently scheduled for 3 hours
after the second CSC programming contest ends (not to mention,
within easy walking distance)!
