title: Uva 12620  Fibonacci Sum
---


```
A Fibonacci sequence is calculated by adding the previous two members of the sequence, with the first
two members being both 1.

f(1) = 1; f(2) = 1; f(n > 2) = f(n 1) + f(n 2)

We define a special fibonacci sequence where the maximum value in the sequence is 99. If a value
in the sequence is greater than 99, a module 100 operation must be applied. The result is the following
sequence:

1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 44 33 77 10 87 97 84 81 65 ...

Your task is to calculate the sum of the numbers in this special fibonacci sequence between two
given positions.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases. The first line indicates the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains two integers: N and M (N  M). N is the position of the
first number that you should sum, and M is the position of the last number that you should sum. M
is not greater than 1012.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, you have to output the result of the sum in a different line.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
1 3
4 4
5 100
1 99999

```

## Sample Output

```
4
3
5068
4933400
```
