## Input

```text

In recent weeks, geek tabloids have hit the newsstands around the world with a truly remarkable
breakthrough in science: a group of researchers from Chinese universities have written a paper about
the role of psychology in winning (or losing) at rock-paper-scissors (RPS). After studying how players
change or keep their strategies during multiple-round sessions, the scientists figured out a basic rule
that people tend to play by that could potentially be exploited. This rule is called the win-stay and
lose-shift strategy.

An RPS session is a finite sequence of rounds played between two opponents. In each round, players
simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock (R), paper (P), and scissors
(S). Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock; if both players throw the same
shape, the round is tied. The outcome of a round for a player is 1 point if he/she wins, 1 point if
he/she loses, and 0 points if it is a tie. The outcome of a session for a player is the sum over the
outcome points of his/her rounds. For example, assume that a and b are playing a session of three
rounds. In the first round a plays scissors and b plays paper; in the second round a plays paper and b
plays paper; and, in the last round a plays rock and b plays rock. Then, the outcome of the first round
for a is 1 point (for b is 1 point), and the outcomes of the second and third rounds for a is 0 points
(for b is also 0 points). Consequently, the outcome of this session for a is 1 point and for b is 1 point.

During an RPS session, the win-stay and lose-shift strategy for a player p is as follows:

 If it is the first round or if it was a tie in the previous round, for the current round p makes a
guess.

 If p lost in the previous round, for the current round p switches to the thing that beats ps
opponent previous choice.

 If p won in the previous round, for the current round p switches to the thing that beats ps previous
choice.

For example, assume that a and b are playing a session of three rounds, and a is playing under the
win-stay and lose-shift strategy and that b plays as above. Initially a guesses R and loses (P beats R).
In the second round a switches to S because it beats bs previous winning choice (i.e., P) and wins (S
beats P). In the third round a switches to R because it beats as previous choice (i.e., S) and ties (b also
plays R). In this session the outcome for a is 0 points. However, this is not the only possible outcome
for a under the win-stay and lose-shift strategy.

Given a session of n rounds for players a and b, and the probabilities of a guessing R, P, and S during
the session, you are asked to write a program that decides if as expected session outcome when playing
under the win-stay and lose-shift strategy against b is better than as actual session outcome.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains a non-negative integer number N (N  0) indicating the number of
test cases. Then N test cases follow, each consisting of three lines of input. The first and second lines
of a test case contain, respectively, strings a and b only containing characters R, P, and S (1  |a|  104,
1  |b|  104, with |a| = |b|) defining an RPS session of |a| rounds played between players a and b. The
third line of a test case contains three blank-separated integer numbers pR, pP , and pS (0  pR  100,
0  pP  100, 0  pS  100, with pR + pP + pS = 100) indicating, respectively, the probability
(amplified by 100) of a guessing rock, scissors, and paper.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a single line containing three blank-separated quantities of the form

x y z

where

 x is an integer indicating as actual session outcome against b,

 y is a floating point number indicating as expected session outcome when playing against b with
probabilities pR, pP , and pS under the win-stay and lose-shift strategy (rounded up to exactly 4
decimal places, with no leading zeroes but at least one digit before the decimal point), and

 z is the character Y if y is strictly greater than x, and N, otherwise.
