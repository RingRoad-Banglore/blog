## Input

```text
I have written two songs, one is called  (This song was written in 2005, but did not get any serious
treatment until in 2007, when I participated in Tsinghua Universitys Campus singers competition)
and the other one  (This song was written especially for the final round of Tsinghua Universitys
Campus singers competition, April 2008).

Writing songs requires a lot of work, especially when you need to give a performance on a stage, in
a serious competition. You need to polish your lyrics, melody, orchestration (The lyrics of both songs
were written by Bing Song, harmony primarily by Kai Chung Tam and Zhen Shang, orchestration
was done by Jun Huang, and the initial piano score was written by Qindi Li. I thank them from the
bottom of my heart) again and again, and you need a lot of rehearsals with your friends (who play the
piano/flute etc, or sing harmony).

Here is the photo of my team before the performance of .

You may wonder how I wrote songs. The short answer is: I didnt write songs, I just select from
music fragments that automatically came into my mind. So it is essential to note down the melody
quickly when it suddenly appears.

Unfortunately, I dont have absolute pitch or well-developed long-term relative pitch, so I have
to stick to the movable do system (Its called  in Chinese. See, for example the web
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge).

I use 1..7 to represent do, re, mi, fa, sol, la to si, and #1 to represent #Do etc. When Im changing
the key, Ill write syllables in both keys (formatted as s1 = s2 that means this note is syllable s1 in
the old key, which is also syllable s2 in the new key), like this:

Well, I admit this is a weird way to transcript the birthday song, but ... You know what I mean, right?

However, after I wrote down the whole thing, I often find a lot of ridiculous modulations (i.e.
changing key)  I just couldnt understand why I changed the key. Luckily, I dont need to know

why. All I need is a small tool that rewrites the (possibly weird) melody in a reasonable way. By
reasonable, I mean a good balance between the number of modulations and the number of accidentals
(i.e. sharp or flats).

Given the maximum number of accidentals, find a transcript with minimal modulations.
Notes:

 Dont worry about the missing octaves information (e.g. the 5 5 5 3 part actually contains three
sos in two different octaves) and rhythm information. I can always remember them.

 I always explicitly written down every accidental (both before and after rewriting). For example,
if I write b7 7, the second note is a normal si. Also, I never write things like b4 or #7
(both before and after conversion), Ill write 3 and 1 instead.

 When counting accidentals, #5=b3 contains two accidentals, though its only one note.

 If there are multiple solutions, print the lexicographically smallest one (the melody should be
regarded as a sequence of strings). For example, 1 2 b3 || can be rewritten to 1=2 3 4 || or
1 2=3 4. The second one is better. However, 6 7 1 is better than both, because there is no
modulation at all!

 You may change the first note. For example, the optimal way to express both b7 b7 b7 b7 ||
and 5 5 5 5 || is 1 1 1 1 ||.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case contains two lines. The
first line contains the maximal number of accidentals, and the second line contains the initial transcript,
ending with a double barline (||). Adjacent symbols are separated by a single space. There will be no
more than 100 notes/barlines in each transcript.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the transcript with minimal modulations. If there are multiple solutions, print
the lexicographically smallest one (dont forget the transcript is regarded as a sequence of strings, not
a big string). Barlines (| and ||) should be output as-is.
Background

For those who are not familiar with music, here is some information:

 There are 12 different syllables in the movable do system: 1, #1, 2, #2, 3, 4, #4, 5, #5, 6, #6, 7.
The pitch interval of adjacent syllables is one semitone. You can label them 0 11, and the pitch
interval calculation is done mod 12. For example, the pitch interval of #6 and 2 is 2-10=4 (mod
12), you can also get this by counting: #6 ->7 -> 1 -> #1 -> 2. Four semitones.

 When we hear 1 2 3, we may also consider it 4 5 6, because the sequence of adjacent pitch
interval of both melody is (2, 2). Similarly, 2 3 4 5 and 6 7 1 2 (the last 1 2 is in a higher
octave) are similar, because their sequence of adjacent pitch interval are both (2, 1, 2). Here
similar means we can rewrite either melody to the other.

 Now consider the last example, 1 #1 2 #2 3 #4, the pitch interval sequence is (1, 1, 1, 1,
2). The rewritten transcript has one modulation, so it can be divided into two parts: 2 #2 3
4=3 and 4=3 4 5, the pitch interval sequence of the first part is (1, 1, 1), and the second
sequence is (1, 2). Note that in the first part 4=3 uses its old syllable 4, and in the second
part, 4=3 uses its new syllable, 3. Another solution with minimal number of modulation but
lexicographically larger, is 3 4 #4 5=3 4 5 ||
