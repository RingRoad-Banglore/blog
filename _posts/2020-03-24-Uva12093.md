title: Uva 12093  Protecting Zonk

## Input

```text

In a star system far, far away, there are two civilised planets: Zonq and Clunq. Zonq is a lovely planet
with plenty of natural resources and its inhabitants, the zonq-ians, developed into a peace-loving people,
with high moral standards and a rich culture of arts, sciences and all things nice. Clunq, on the other
hand, is a cold, dark planet where the resources are scarce, and its inhabitants, the clunq-ons, struggle
for their existence from the day they are born. It is no wonder they developed into strong fighters, and
martial arts are their main form of culture.

As always happens in the universe, at some
point in their development the clunq-ons in-
vented space exploration, and now they are
on the verge of loading their space-ships with
warriors to conquer Zonq. Although the zonq-
ians developed mathematics to a very high level
(they factorize million digit numbers for break-
fast and the proof of Fermats Last Theorem
is taught in elementary school), they never
bothered to tire themselves with such mundane
things as computers and informatics. So now
they need your help to defend the planet.

Zonq consists of a number of villages con-
nected by roads. Since the zonq-ians hate phys-
ical labour, they built just enough roads to in-
sure that all villages are mutually connected,

directly or indirectly, but not one road more. When the clunq-ons invade, they will always land on a
road, halfway between two villages, and spread out from there. To defend the roads, the zonq-ians can
place guard robots in their villages. There are two types: soldier-bots and sergeant-bots. A soldier-bot,
when placed in a village, protects all roads connected to that village. A sergeant-bot is more powerful:
it protects the roads connected to the village it is placed in, but also all roads connected to the villages
that are direct neighbors to it. Both types of robot come at a price, and its your task to assign robots
to villages such that: a) all roads are protected, b) the total cost of the robots is as low as possible.
```

## Output

```text
There are several scenarios. Each scenario starts with three numbers on a line by it self: N (1  N 
10000), the number of villages, C1 (0  C1  1000), the cost of a soldier-bot, and C2 (0  C2  1000),
the cost of a sergeant-bot. For the sake of abstraction, the villages are numbered from 1 to N . Then
follow N  1 lines containing two numbers V1 (1  V1  N) and V2 (1  V2  N), each defining a
road between two villages, numbered V1 and V2, respectively. No road is mentioned twice, and all roads
together span all villages.

A line with three zeros marks the end of the input and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each scenario in the input, print just one number on a line by it self: the minimal cost of protecting
Zonq.

PS. How were the zonq-ians able to utilize robots, if they never bothered to build computers? Well,
thats a stupid question: they called 0800-RENT-A-BOT, of course! How else do you think they hired
you, in the first place?
