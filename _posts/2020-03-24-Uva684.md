```
Write a program to find the determinant of an integral square matrix. Note that the determinant of
a square matrix can be defined recursively as follows: the determinant of a 11 matrix M = (a1,1) is
just the value |M | = a1,1; further, the determinant of an n n matrix is

|M | =
n

i=1

(1)i+1  |M1,j |.

Here the notation M1,i is the (n1) (n1) matrix by removing the first row and the i-th column
of the original n n matrix M .

A straightforward method of calculating the determinant of an nn matrix by the recursive method
will end up with n! multiplications, a very time-consuming algorithm. To give you a feeling about this,
note that 15! = 1,307,674,368,000. To reduce the time complexity, there are two ways of modifying the
original matrix for easier computation.

1. Exchanging two columns (or rows) of a matrix will change the sign of the determinant; for example 1 23 4
 = 

 2 14 3


2. Multiplying one column by any constant, and add them to another column will not change the
value of the determinant; for example:

2 1 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

 =

2 1 3 + 2 2
4 5 6 + 4 2
7 8 9 + 7 2


Using the above methods, you shall be able to write a program for computing the determinants of

matrices, even for a size like 3030, very efficiently. Below is an example to show how this can be done:
2 3 5
1 6 7
4 8 9

 =

2 3 2 5 2 2
1 6 1 7 1 2
4 8 4 9 4 2

 =

2 1 1
1 5 5
4 4 1

 = 

1 1 2
5 5 1
1 4 4


= 


1 1 1 2 1 2
4 5 5 1 5 2
1 4 1 4 1 2

 = 

1 0 0
5 0 9
1 3 2

 = 
 0 93 2

 = 27
Note that the answer shall be an integer. That is, all the operations needed are just integer oper-

ations; by reducing to floating numbers would result in the round-off errors, which will be considered
as the wrong answer. Do not worry about the problem of integral overflows problem. You can assume
that the given data set will not cause the integer overflow problem. What is emphasized here is the
required integer precision.

## Input

```
Several sets of integral matrices. The inputs are just a list of integers. Within each set, the first integer
(in a single line) represents the size of the matrix, n, which can be as large as 30, indication an n n
matrix. After n, there will be n lines representing the n rows of the matrix; each line (row) contains
exactly n integers. Thus, there is totally n2 integers for the particular matrix. These matrices will
occur repeatedly in the input as the pattern described above. An integer n = 0 (zero) signifies the end
of input.
