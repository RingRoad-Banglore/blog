title: Uva 01215  String Cutting
---


## Input

```

Lets consider a string s of length n (0 < n < 10000) containing only characters from a to z. We define
a cut ci (0 < i < n) is an action splitting the string s into 2 substrings s1 and s2 so that s1 consists
of first i characters of s and s2 consists of remaining characters from s. Each cut is associated with a
cost which equals to the total number of characters consisted in either s1 or s2 but not in both. For
example, let s = abcbacbd, the cut c5 will break s into s1 = abcba and s2 = cbd with the cost of 2.

The original string can be cut into k + 1 substrings after applying k cuts sequentially to the string
and its subsequent substrings. In order to simply describe these k cuts, we specify the position of the
cuts with regard to the original string.

Lets consider an example where we sequentially apply 3 cuts at positions 5, 3 and 6 to the string
s = ababccd. After the first cut at position 5, we have two substrings s1 = ababc and s2 = cd with
the cost of 3. The second cut at position 3 breaks s1 into two substrings s11 = aba and s12 = bc
with the cost of 2. The last cut at position 6 breaks s2 into two substrings s21 = c and s22 = d with
the cost of 2. The total cost for the 3 cuts is 3+2+2=7. Given a string and their cuts, your task is to
write a program to compute the total cost for the cut.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several data sets. The first line of the input file contains the number of data sets
which is a positive integer and is not bigger than 20. The following lines describe the data sets.

For each data set, the first line contains the integer number k (1  k  1000). The second line
contains k positive integer numbers describing the position of k cuts. The third line contains the string
which will be cut.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, write in one line the total cost of the cuts.
