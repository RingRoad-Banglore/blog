title: Uva 13279  Divisors
---


```
The  number of divisor function or  d(n) is a very interesting function in number theory. It denotes
the number of positive divisors of a particular number. For example  d(24) = 8 as  24 has eight divisors
 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and  24 . In mathematics factorial of a positive integer number  n is written as  n!
and is defined  as  below:

n! = 1 2 3     n =
n

i=1

i

Another  interesting  function  AF (n)   (Again  factorial  in  short)  is  defined  as:

AF (n) = 1! 2! 3! . . . n! =
n

i=1

i!

Given n ,  your  job  is  to  find  the  value  of d(AF (n)).
```

## Input

```
The input file contains at most  101 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer n (0 < n < 5000001) .
Input  is  terminated  by  a  line  containing  a  single  zero.  This  value  should  not  be  processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output.

This line contains the modulo  100000007 (108 + 7) of d(AF (n)).
