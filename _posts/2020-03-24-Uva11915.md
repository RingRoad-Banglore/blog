```
Consider a tuple P1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn. Now consider the following recurrence function.

 F (P1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn) = 0 if any of the Pi is negative or the tuple P is not sorted in non-increasing
order.

 F (P1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn) = 1 if all of the Pis is zero.

 F (P1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn) = F (P1  1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn) + F (P1, P2  1, P3, . . . , Pn) + F (P1, P2, P3 
1, . . . , Pn) + F (P1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn  1) otherwise.

For example if n is 4 then the value
F (4, 3, 2,1) is 0 because the last parameter is negative.
F (4, 3, 2, 5) is 0 because the tuple is not sorted from the largest to smallest.
F (3, 3, 2, 1) = F (3, 3, 2, 1) + F (4, 2, 2, 1) + F (4, 3, 1, 1) + F (4, 3, 2, 0)
F (1, 1, 0, 0) = F (0, 1, 0, 0) + F (1, 0, 0, 0) + F (1, 1,1, 0) + F (1, 1, 0,1) = 2
Given the tuple P your task is to calculate the value of F (P1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn). The result can be very
big so output the result mod1, 000, 000, 009 (this is a prime number).
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T (T  50), denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. First line contains n. Second line contains n integers separated
by a single space. These are the tuple P . n is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. Each of the numbers in
tuple P is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. P will be sorted in non-increasing order.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output contains a line in the format Case x: R where x is the case number (starting
from 1) and R is the value of F (P1, P2, P3, . . . , Pn) mod 1, 000, 000, 009.
