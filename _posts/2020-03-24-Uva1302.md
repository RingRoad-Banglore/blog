## Input

```text

Hart is engaged in playing an interesting game, Gnome Tetravex, these days. In the game, at the
beginning, the player is given n  n squares. Each square is divided into four triangles marked four
numbers (range from 0 to 9). In a square, the triangles are the left triangle, the top triangle, the right
triangle and the bottom triangle. For example, Fig. 1 shows the initial state of 2 2 squares.

The player is required to move the squares to the termination state. In the termination state, any
two adjoining squares should make the adjacent triangle marked with the same number. Fig. 2 shows
one of the termination states of the above example.

Fig. 1 The initial state with 2 2 squares Fig. 2 One termination state of the above
example

It seems the game is not so hard. But indeed, Hart is not accomplished in the game. He can finish
the easiest game successfully. When facing with a more complex game, he can find no way out.

One day, when Hart was playing a very complex game, he cried out, The computer is making a
goose of me. Its impossible to solve it. To such a poor player, the best way to help him is to tell him
whether the game could be solved. If he is told the game is unsolvable, he neednt waste so much time
on it.

## Output

```text
The input file consists of several game cases. The first line of each game case contains one integer n,
0  n  5, indicating the size of the game.

The following n  n lines describe the marking number of these triangles. Each line consists of four
integers, which in order represent the top triangle, the right triangle, the bottom triangle and the left
triangle of one square.

After the last game case, the integer 0 indicates the termination of the input data set.
