title: Uva 10595  Knight on the Bee Board
---


```
The bee board consists of many hexagons instead of square of a chessboard. The other difference is
chessboard has only 64 squares. But the bee board may have as many as 10000 hexagons. The main
thing is choosing an arbitrary hexagon as number 1 hexagon of the board. And other hexagons are
numbered sequentially clockwise direction. A knight acts as a regular knight that used in chess game
but it can move 12 different directions. For example from cell number 1 the knight can move to cell
number 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35 and 36.
