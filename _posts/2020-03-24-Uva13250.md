title: Uva 13250  Balance Game
---


## Input

```
Consider a puzzle with three types of tokens. Tokens of the same type have the same weight and any
two tokens of different type have different weight. There are M copies of each token type. There is a
two-plate scale where tokens can be placed. There is also a given object with known weight W that can
be put on the plates of the scale. The goal of the puzzle is to balance the scale with some of the tokens
to check the weight of the object. If used, tokens of the same type must be allocated on the same plate.

For example, suppose that there are three token types with weights 20, 50, and 40 grams, respec-
tively. Also, there are M = 3 copies of each token type. If the given object weights W = 140 grams,
then its weight can be checked in five different ways (neglecting the order of the plates):

Five different ways to achieve the goal

However, it is impossible to measure the weight W = 105 with this set of tokens.
Your job is to write a computer program to determine the number of different ways to check the

weight of the object.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two blank-separated
integers M and W (1  M  5 000 and 1  W  5 000 000) indicating, respectively, the number of
copies of each token type and the weight of the object to be checked. Then there is a line containing
three distinct blank-separated integers n1, n2, and n3 representing the weigths of each token type
(1  ni  1 000, for each 1  i  3, n1 = n2, n1 = n3, n2 = n3).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a single line indicating the number of different ways the given weight can be
checked with the set of tokens.

## Sample Output

```
3 140
20 50 40
3 105
20 50 40
