title: Uva 11665  Chinese Ink
---


## Input

```
Lucca, my four-years-old daughter, loves drawing polygons in bond paper. For example, yesterday she
drew two squares, a rectangle and two triangles:

Today, she wanted to fill her figures with black chinese ink. I helped her, obtaining the next result:

She asked me: how many black zones do you see?. I said: two. Im bored answering the same
question everyday. Can you help us writing a program that, given a collection of black filled polygons,
determines the number of black zones on the drawing?

For a precise understanding: a black zone is a region of black coloured points on the sheet, where
every pair of them may be connected by a continuous line within the region.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is represented as follows:

 A line with an integer N (1  N  40) which indicates the number of polygons in the drawing.

 N lines, one per polygon, each one containing a list of 2  t integer numbers x1 y1 x2 y2 ...
xt yt specifying the points in the boundary of the polygon (104  xi, yi  104, 3  t 
10). The drawn polygon is bounded by the closed path composed of the straight line segments
(x1, y1)(x2, y2), (x2, y2)(x3, y3), ..., (xt1, yt1)(xt, yt), and (xt, yt)(x1, y1). You can suppose that
the drawn polygon is a simple polygon (a polygon whose boundary is a non-self-intersecting closed
path).

The end of the input is indicated when N = 0.
