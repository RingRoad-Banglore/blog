title: Uva 13181  Sleeping in hostels
---


```
As any good pilgrim knows, hostels that one finds along the
roads usually have huge rooms where rows and rows of beds
wait to be occupied.

Although these beds have been used by a countless num-
ber of people before, tiredness makes everyone not to care
to be lying on mattresses frayed by time in order to sleep a
good handful of hours in a row and gather strength for the
following day.

In fact, to maximize the possibilities of getting a good
nights sleep, the most important thing is not the salubrity of the mattress, but the distance to the
closest pilgrin. Thats because a night with an unknown person snoring in a bed next to you can ruin
your night way more than a bunch of mites.

When you go inside one of these rooms, the objective is, then, to find a bed that maximizes the
distance with the closest pilgrim (to both sides).
```

## Input

```
Input is composed by several test cases that represent the occupation of a row of beds one night of the
journey.

Each of the rows appears in a single line that contains a sequence of . and X (up to 500,000
characters). The dots represent empty beds, while the X represent occupied beds. It is guaranteed
that there is always at least one empty and one occupied bed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write a line with the maximum possible number of empty beds that you can have
between the selected bed and the closest neighbour.
