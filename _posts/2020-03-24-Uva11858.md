title: Uva 11858  Frosh Week
---


## Input

```text
During Frosh Week, students play various fun games
to get to know each other and compete against
other teams. In one such game, all the frosh on
a team stand in a line, and are then asked to ar-
range themselves according to some criterion, such as
their height, their birth date, or their student num-
ber. This rearrangement of the line must be accom-
plished only by successively swapping pairs of consec-
utive students. The team that finishes fastest wins.
Thus, in order to win, you would like to minimize the
number of swaps required.
```

## Output

```text
Input contains several test cases. For each test case,
the first line of input contains one positive integer
n, the number of students on the team, which will
be no more than one million. The following n lines
each contain one integer, the student number of each
student on the team. No student number will appear
more than once.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing the minimum number of swaps required to arrange the
students in increasing order by student number.
