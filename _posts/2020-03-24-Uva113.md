## Input

```text
Current work in cryptography involves (among other things) large prime numbers and computing powers
of numbers modulo functions of these primes. Work in this area has resulted in the practical use of
results from number theory and other branches of mathematics once considered to be of only theoretical
interest.

This problem involves the efficient computation of integer roots of numbers.

Given an integer n  1 and an integer p  1 you are to write a program that determines np, the
positive n-th root of p. In this problem, given such integers n and p, p will always be of the form kn
for an integer k (this integer is what your program must find).
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of a sequence of integer pairs n and p with each integer on a line by itself. For all
such pairs 1  n  200, 1  p < 10101 and there exists an integer k, 1  k  109 such that kn = p.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each integer pair n and p the value np should be printed, i.e., the number k such that kn = p.

```
