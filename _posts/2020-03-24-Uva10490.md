title: Uva 10490  Mr Azad and his Son
---


## Input

```
There are a lot of Abul Kalam Azad in Bangladesh. But, why is he so special? Not that he is my dad
is the only reason. He can wonderfully do some calculation. If anyone gives him any positive integer
k, he amazingly can say the relative perfect number 2k1(2k  1) without using neither calculator nor
computer. Say, I have told him to find out the relative perfect number of 2, he replies 6 which is a
perfect number. But perfect is not possible for all the integers. I have asked him the process, but he
says that I should find this thing out by myself how an integer is related to a perfect number. Anyway,
I have challenged him that it is very possible for me to do the same calculation using a computer.
Although I could not figure out how he can do this, I know that the next ACM Online Programming
Contest is near at hand and Worlds top programmers are available to solve my very simple problem.

Now, you are to write a program for me to win over my dad, which will take input n, and determine
the perfect number p.
```

## Output

```
An integer 1 < n  31 is given in each input line.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output will be in the following format:

 If perfect number is possible
Perfect: p!

 If perfect number is not possible, but given number is prime
Given number is prime. But, NO perfect number is available.

 If perfect number is not possible and given number is not prime
Given number is NOT prime! NO perfect number is available.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
3
6
0

```
