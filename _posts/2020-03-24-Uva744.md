title: Uva 00744  Triangular Museum
---


## Input

```
A museum has K2 triangular rooms, where (0  K  10). All rooms have the same size and there
is exactly one guard in each room. The shape of the museum itself is also triangular, as exemplified
in Figure 1, where a museum with 32 triangular rooms is shown. The names AA, BB, CC, ... are guard
names (a guard name is a sequence of at most 10 letters). Thus guard DD is at the top room of the
initial configuration presented in Figure 1.

Each two adjacent rooms are separated by exactly one wall, which has a door that connects the
rooms. Since the guards would also like to appreciate the art in the museum, they agree to exchange
their positions, thus forming a new configuration, previously agreed upon. The order in which the
guards move to their new positions obey a few rules. These rules, for security reasons, do not allow
guards to leave their positions all at the same time. The only way they can move is by exchanging their
positions with guards in adjacent rooms, one pair at a time.

The objective of this problem is to find a sequence of exchanges between guards that leads to the
new configuration.

## Output

```
The input file may contain several instances of the problem. Each instance consists of two lines: the
first contains the integer K; the second line contains the sequence of K2 guard names in the initial
configuration (from the top to bottom and left to right) followed by the K2 guard names in the new
configuration (also from the top to bottom and left to right).

There is at least one blank space between these strings of letters. The last line of the input file
contains only the value 0 (zero) which should not be processed.

Instances are NOT separated by blank lines.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each instance in the input file, the program must write the value N in a line, where N is the number
of exchanges performed between guards in adjacent rooms, followed by N lines, N  4K3, each with
the names of two guards been exchanged; the names of the guards are separated by a blank space. Two
instances are separated by a blank line.
