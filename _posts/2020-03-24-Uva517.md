## Input

```text
Dr. R. E. Wrights class was studying modified L-Systems. Let us explain necessary details. As a
model let us have words of length n over a two letter alphabet {a, b}. The words are cyclic, this means
we can write one word in any of n forms we receive by cyclic shift, whereby the first and the last letters
in the word are considered to be neighbours.

Rewriting rules rewrite a letter at a position i, depending on letters at the positions i2, i, i+1. We
rewrite all letters of the word in one step. When we have a given starting word and a set of rewriting
rules a natural question is: how does the word look after s rewriting steps?

Help Dr. R. E. Wright and write a program which solves this task.
```

## Output

```text
There are several blocks in the input file, each describing one system. There is an integer number n,
2 < n < 16 the length of the input word in the first line. There is a word in the next line. The
word contains only lowercase letters a and b. There are four characters c1c2c3c4 in the next eight
lines. Each quadruple represents one rewriting rule with the following meaning: when the letter at the
position i  2 is c1 and the letter at the position i is c2 and the letter at the position i + 1 is c3 then
the letter at the position i after rewriting will be c4. Rewriting rules are correct and complete. There
is an integer number s, 0  s  2000000000, in the last line of the block.

```

## Sample Input

```text
There is one line corresponding to each block of the input file. The line contains a word which we
receive after s rewriting steps from the corresponding starting word using given rewriting rules. As we
mentioned above, the word can be written in any of n cyclic shifted forms. The output file contains the
lexicographically smallest word, assuming that a < b.
