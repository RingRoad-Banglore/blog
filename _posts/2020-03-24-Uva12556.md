title: Uva 12556  Center of perimeter midpoints
---


## Input

```
When I was a high school student, I learned that given a triangle ABC, denote D, E, F as the midpoints
of AB, BC and CA, then three segments CD, AE, BF intersects at one point: the centroid.

Then I thought about the following question: if we change midpoint by perimeter midpoint,
can CD, AE, BF still intersect at one point?

To be precise, if CA+AD = DB+BC, we say D is the perimeter midpoint on AB.

Its not difficult to see that there is exactly one such point lying strictly inside the segment AB.
Point E and F are defined similarly and also have unique positions.

Help (the younger) me to find out the answer!
```

## Output

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case contains 6 integers x1, y1,
x2, y2, x3, y3, whose absolute values do not exceed 100. These integers represent three non-collinear
points A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(x3, y3).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, if CD, AE, BF intersect at one point, print the position of the intersection to 6
decimal places. Otherwise print ERROR (without quotes).

```

## Sample Output

```
2
-1 0 1 0 0 1
0 0 5 0 3 3

```
