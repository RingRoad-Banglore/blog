Saint Andrerws Road, part of the Formula One circuit
(Kenny Pek, Piccom)

Singapore will host a Formula One race in
2008. The race will be held on a 5.067km
long street circuit, consisting of 14 left
hand turns and 10 right hand turns. In
the run up to the F1 race, the number of
illegal night street racing activities have
been on the rise. Such races consists of
several rounds around a designated street
circuit.

The authorities would like to deploy a
new vehicle monitoring system in order to
catch these illegal Saint Andrews Road,
part of the Formula One circuit racers.
The system consists of a (Kenny Pek, Pic-
com) number of cameras mounted along
various roads. For the system to be effec-
tive, there should be at least one camera
along each of the possible circuits.

The Singapore road system can be represented as a series of junctions and connecting bidirectional
roads (see Figure 5). A possible racing circuit consists of a start junction followed by a path consisting
of three or more roads that eventually leads back to the start junction. Each road in a racing circuit
can be traversed only in one direction, and only once.

Your task is to write a program that computes the optimal placement of the vehicle-monitoring
cameras. You will be provided with a description of a connected road network to be monitored in terms
of the roads and junctions. The junctions are identified by the bigger numbers in Figure 5. A camera
can be deployed on the roads (and not the junctions).

The cost of deploying a camera depends on the road on which it is placed. The smaller numbers by
the roads in Figure 5 indicate the cost of deploying a camera on that road. Your job is to select a set
of roads that minimizes the total cost of deployment while ensuring that there is at least one camera
along every possible racing circuit (i.e. loop in the road network).

## Output

```text
The input consists of a line containing the number c of datasets, followed by c datasets, followed by a
line containing the number 0.

The first line of each dataset contains two positive integers, n and m, separated by a blank, which
represent the number of junctions and number of roads, respectively. You may assume that 0 < n <
10000 and 0 < m < 100000. For simplicity, we label each of the n junctions from 1 to n. The following
m lines of each dataset each describes one road. Each line consists of three positive integers which
are the labels of two different junctions and the cost of deploying a camera on this road. The cost of
deploying a camera is between 1 and 1000.

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of one line for each dataset. The c-th line contains one single number, representing
the minimal cost of setting up the vehicle monitoring system such that there is at least one camera

along every possible circuit.

optimal placement of cameras

Note: The sample data set depicts the
situation shown in Figure 5. The two
cameras show where cameras might be
placed in order to monitor each circuit at
minimal cost. Since each of the cameras
have a cost of 3, the total minimal cost is
6.
