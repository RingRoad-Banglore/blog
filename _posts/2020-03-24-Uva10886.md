title: Uva 10886  Standard Deviation
---


## Input

```
Anyone who considers arithmetic methods of producing

random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.
John von Neumann, 1951.

Given a list of n real numbers, (x1, x2, . . . , xn), the mean is defined as

m =
1

n

n
i=1

xi

The standard deviation is defined as the square root of

1

n

n
i=1

(xi m)2

Given n and a random number generator seed, compute the standard deviation of the first n numbers
returned by the generator.

The generator function is given below. I apologize to all those for whom C is not a native language.

unsigned long long seed;
long double gen()
{

static const long double Z = ( long double )1.0 / (1LL<<32);
seed >>= 16;
seed &= ( 1ULL << 32 ) - 1;
seed *= seed;
return seed * Z;

}
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (at most 40). N test cases follow. Each one is a
line containing an integer, n (1  n  10, 000, 000), and an integer, seed (0  seed < 264).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the standard deviation of the
first n numbers returned by gen() after seed is initialized to the given value. Round the answer to 5
decimal places. Answers with absolute error of at most 104 will be deemed correct.

If you need a hint, read the problem again.
