title: Uva 11903  eFriends
---


```
Social networking web sites are very popular these days. I am not mentioning any names because you
know better than me. People do have a lot of e-friends now, you may not know his real identity but
he is your friend. Sometimes, there can be rivalries between people, and thus people gets blocked or
deleted. And these rivalries dont have to be necessarily commutative. That means x may think y as
his enemy, but y may or may not think so.

However, what if you get the opportunity to see all your e-friends live? Since you like social networks
very much, you planned to arrange a get-together with your e-friends. So, you invited n of your e-friends
in your home. For simplicity, you numbered them from 1 to n. They were your friends, but rivalries
existed amongst many of them. You asked them to form a queue such that they can get food from the
table. And you will serve foods one by one. But your friends demanded that, no enemy should be the
next person in the queue. That means if x thinks that y is his enemy and xs position in the queue is
i, then ys position shouldnt be i 1.

So, it became very complex. Thats why you decided to add a dissatisfaction index k if ones demand
is not fulfilled. And the total dissatisfaction index is the summation of all the dissatisfaction indexes.
Now you know the rivalries and the maximum total dissatisfaction index you may allow, you want to
find the total number of possible arrangements.

## Input

```
The first line of input will contain T ( 30) denoting the number of cases.

Each case starts with 3 integers n (1  n  12), k (0  k  106) and q (1  q  1000) which denotes
the number of queries. Then there will be n lines. The i-th line contains an integer ti (0  ti < n) and
ids of ti distinct friends. It means i-th person thinks the ti listed persons as his enemy. Each of the
next q lines contains an integer r (0  r  108) denoting the total allowable dissatisfaction index.

```
