title: Uva 11462  Age Sort
---


## Input

```

You are given the ages (in years) of all people of a country with at least 1 year of age. You know that
no individual in that country lives for 100 or more years. Now, you are given a very simple task of
sorting all the ages in ascending order.
```

## Output

```
There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each case starts with an integer n (0 < n  2000000), the
total number of people. In the next line, there are n integers indicating the ages. Input is terminated
with a case where n = 0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print a line with n space separated integers. These integers are the ages of that country
sorted in ascending order.

Warning: Input Data is pretty big ( 25 MB) so use faster IO.
