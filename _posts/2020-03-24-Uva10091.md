title: Uva 10091  The Valentines Day
---


## Input

```
As you all know that Valentines Day is celebrated on 14th February each year. But sadly, this year in
Bangladesh there was Hartal (A sort of strike when motor vehicles sleep idle and people are reluctant
to go outside) on 14th February so people could not celebrate it. Generally, the sale of flowers increases
by ten times on this day but this year the sale was almost unchanged and the flower shop owners were
in great pain. One of them said in frustration I wish my flowers were all vegetables so that I could eat
them. but as you all know this was not to be. However, our problem is not related with this incident.
Before stating the real problem we should look at the following history of Valentines Day:

Valentines Day started in the time of the Roman Empire. Under the rule of Emperor Claudius II,
Rome was involved in many bloody and unpopular military campaigns. Claudius the Cruel, as he was
known at the time, was having a difficult time getting soldiers to join his military leagues. He believed
that the reason was that roman men did not want to leave their loves or families. As a result, Claudius
cancelled all marriages and engagements in Rome.

This was when a Christian priest named Valentine came to defend love in the empire. Valentine
began to secretly marry couples despite the emperors orders. When Emperor Claudius was informed of
these ceremonies Valentine was sent to prison where he remained until his death on February 14 in 270
AD.

It wasnt until a few hundred years later when Valentines Day began to develop, as we know it. At
the time, Christianity was beginning to take control of Europe. As part of this effort the Church sought
to do away with pagan holidays. Valentines Day came to replace a mid-February fertility festival called
Lupercalia. In honor of his sacrifice for love Valentine was made a saint and Lupercalia renamed in his
honor. To be specific we should assume in this problem that the celebration of Valentines Day started
in 470 AD.

Fig: A Map of Eight Cities

Our problem is on a newly married couple A and
B. Both of them are service holders and the property
of their job is that in every new month they are trans-
ferred to a new city, which is adjacent to the previous
one or remains in the old city. The probability of be-
ing transferred to any one of the adjacent cities or not
being transferred is equal. That is if a city C has four
neighboring cities D, E, F, G then his probability of
being transferred to city D the next month is 1/5 =
0.20. The same probability is for being transferred to
E, F and G or remaining in C. You will have to find
out the probability of their being in the same city in
the next available (yet to come) Valentines Day cel-
ebration. In a city with no neighbors (no adjacent
city) no transfer occurs.

## Output

```
The input will contain an integer N that indicates the number of sets of input. Next there will be N
sets of input.

Each set begins with three integers Y (460  Y  10000) that is the initial year and M (1  M 
12), which is the initial month. And D (1  D  31) and no invalid dates. Next there will be one

integers R (R  20) followed by R lines each containing two city names city1 and city2, which indicates
that city1 and city2 are adjacent. If city1 and city2 are equal ignore the input as we have said before
that after the end of a month the person may remain in his current city. There may be redundant
inputs (the same pair of info twice), ignore them also. Some city names may be absent in these R lines
of information but those cities are without neighbors. After these relations there will be two city names
city1 and city2, which are the initial position of A and B. City names will always be an uppercase
character (A..Z)

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input output in a single line the probability of their being in the same city (as stated
before) on the next Valentines Day. Output floats will have five digits after the decimal point. .
