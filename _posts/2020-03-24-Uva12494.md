title: Uva 12494  Distinct Substring
---


## Input

```
Given a string S, Dexter wants to find the number of different substrings in S. He considers two
substrings same if they have a cyclic permutation which is same.

If T = T1T2T3 . . . Tn is a string of length n then it has n cyclic permutations and they are
TiTi+1 . . . TnT1T2 . . . Ti1 for all 1  i  n. (Note that, Tn+1 and T0 are non-existing).

For example, if T = abcd there are 4 cyclic permutations and they are: abcd, bcda, cdab
and dabc.

So, string aba, aab and baa are all considered same. But abc and bac are different as
there is no cyclic permutation of them which are same.
```

## Output

```
First line contains an integer T (T  50) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines
contains a string S which is composed of only lowercase latin letters. You can assume that the length
of S is between 1 and 200 inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the number of different substrings in a line.

Explanation:
If S = abcba there are 10 cyclic different substrings and they are: a, b, c, ab, bc,

abc, bcb, cba, abcb and abcba.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
abcba
aab
zzxzz

```
