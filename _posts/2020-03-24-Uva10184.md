title: Uva 10184  Equidistance
---


## Input

```text
Alice and Bob havent met for some time. Bob isnt very happy about this, so he urges Alice to finally
make time for a meeting. Lets listen to an extract from a phone call:

Alice: ... maybe we should meet on neutral territory.
Bob: Ive already heard this from you  two years ago.
Alice: I know ; I just havent found yet a suitable place that is roughly at the same distance from

both yours and mine.
Bob: Well, the geometric place of the points that are equidistant from two given points on the

surface of a sphere (and the earth is a sphere rather than a disc) is a great circle (namely the one which
intersects the great circle through the given points orthogonally at the center of them). If you insist
only on approximately equal distances though, we get a zone of some kilometers width and about 40000
km length. Not everything in this zone is water. Thus I think it is a feasible task to find a fitting place.

Alice: Now, if I tell you to pick any, well certainly land up in Honolulu.
Bob: Which is not a too bad idea. So, may I pick any ?
Alice: As long as I dont have to accept  but Im open to suggestions.
Bob: Honolulu ?
Alice: Is it situated on aforementioned geometric place at all ??!
Bob: Not quite ...

Nice. Now lets stop the preliminaries and come to the facts: Given two locations on the earths
surface you can find the geometric place of all equidistant points on the surface. For another given
location calculate its distance on the surface to this geometric place. Assume that the earth is a sphere
with a radius of 6378 km.

## Output

```text
The input file consists of two parts: a list of locations and a list of queries.
The location list consists of up to 100 lines, one line per location. Each contains a string and two

floating-point numbers, separated by whitespace, representing the name of the location, its latitude
and its longitude. Names are unique and shorter than 30 characters and do not contain whitespace.
Latitudes are between -90 (South Pole) and 90 (North Pole) inclusive. Longitudes are between -180
and 180 inclusive where negative numbers denote locations west of the meridian and positive numbers
denote locations east of the meridian. (The meridian passes through Greenwich, London.) The location
list is terminated by a line consisting of a single #.

Each line in the query list contains three names of locations. You can assume the first location to
be Alices home, the second location to be Bobs home and the third location to be a possible meeting
point. The query list is terminated by a line consisting of a single #.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query, output a line saying M is x km off A/B equidistance. with M,x,A,B appro-
priately replaced by the location names and the calculated distance rounded to the nearest integer.

If one of the locations in the query didnt occur in the list of locations print ? instead of the
distance.
