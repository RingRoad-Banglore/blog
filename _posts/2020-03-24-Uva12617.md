title: Uva 12617  How Lader
---


## Input

```
Lader is a game that is played in a regular hexagonal board (all sides equal, all angles are also equal).
The game is much similar as pool game. But there is only one hole that is situated in the center of the
hexagon. The position of the board is given by a 2D co-ordinate system. The top and bottom sides of
the hexagon are parallel to x axis. The center of the hexagonal board is situated at (0,0).

You are trying to hit the ball B1 and the direction of hitting is from B1 to B2. After you have hit
the ball B1, it starts reflecting on the walls of the hexagonal Lader board. The initial speed of the ball
is given. When a ball hits a wall, its speed decreases by 1 unit/second. The ball stops when its speed
becomes  0 unit/second.

You have to determine the final speed of the ball when it falls through the hole. If the ball stops
before reaching the hole, print Stops. In this problem assume the followings:

1. There is no loss of speed while rolling freely on the board.

2. The radius of the ball is so small that you can consider it as a point.

3. You may consider the ball fallen in the hole, if at any point the ball is situated at a distance closer
than r + 106 units from the center of the hole, where r is the radius of the hole.

4. The reflection happens according to the standard reflection rule (incident angle = reflection angle,
with respect to the side of the hexagon) except for the case when it hits the corner. That case is
described in 5-th rule.

5. If a ball reaches at the corner (intersection point of two sides), its speed decreases by 2 (it is
assumed that it hits both the walls) and it comes back along the line it hits that corner. If a ball
with speed 1 hits the corner, it stops there.

The picture on the right above shows the movements of a ball on a Lader board. The numbers
written denote the order of appearance.

## Output

```
The first line of the input denotes T (1  T  150), the number of test cases to follow. Each test case
consists of a 6 integers, s (0 < s < 150), x1, y1, x2, y2, r, t (1  t  500). Here, s denotes the length
of sides of the hexagon centered at (0,0).

(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) denote the position of ball B1 and ball B2 respectively. The balls will be
strictly inside the hexagonal board. r denotes the radius of the hole, centered at (0,0). The hole resides
strictly inside the hexagonal board. t denotes the initial speed of the ball.

## Sample Input

```
For each input, you have to print the case number first, followed by the terminal speed when it falls in
the hole. If the ball stops before falling in the hole, print Stops.
