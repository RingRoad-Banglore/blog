10479 The Hendrie Sequence
The Hendrie Sequence “H” is a self-describing sequence defined as follows:

• H(1) = 0

• If we expand every number x in H to a subsequence containing x 0’s followed by the number x+1,
the resulting sequence is still H (without its first element).

Thus, the first few elements of H are:

0,1,0,2,1,0,0,3,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,3,0,...

You must write a program that, given n, calculates the nth element of H.

## Input
Each test case consists of a single line containing the integer n (0 < n < 263) . Input is terminated with
a line containing the number ‘0’ which of course should not be processed.

## Output
For each test case, output the nth element of H on a single line.

## Sample Input
<p>4</p><p>7</p><p>44</p><p>806856837013209088</p><p>0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>2</p><p>0</p><p>3</p><p>16</p>
