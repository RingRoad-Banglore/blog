title: Uva 11911  Farther or Closer
---


## Input

```
In an elementary English class kids are learning the notions of being far or near. To reinforce the kids
sense of these abstract concepts, the teacher introduces his newly invented little class activity called
Farther or Closer (well its not really a new invention; we all know the traditional indoor game called
Hotter Colder:

The teacher has prepared some boxes, arranged into a square as shown in Figure 1 above. As you
can see, the numbers are in row-major order. The game roughly goes as follows: the player is to locate
the box with a candy hidden inside, with reference to the hints given by other students.

In each play, one student is chosen to be the guesser, who first turns around when others put a candy
into one of the boxes. All the other boxes are empty. Then, the guesser starts making his guesses, one
after another. Here a guess is the number written on an available box. If a guess is correct, the students
all shout YES!! loudly and the box is opened. The guesser then gets the candy inside and the game
is over. If the guess is incorrect, however, the guesser receives one of the following three replies from
the other students:

 FARTHER if the correct box is farther away from this guess than from the previous one;

 CLOSER if it is nearer to the current guess; or

 SAME if the distances are the same.

By distance we mean the Euclidean distance between the centres of the boxes. For example, in
Figure 2, the distance between boxes 8 and 9 is one unit, and that between 1 and 8 is


5 units. Hence,

box 8 is closer to 9 than to 1.
For the very first guess the situation is a little bit different. The only two possible replies are

CLOSER (if the chosen box does not contain the candy) or YES!! (if it does).
Under these rules, every player eventually gets a candy as a reward, and therefore there is no

question of finding an optimal strategy to win the game. Nevertheless, the kids have come up with a
clever guessing procedure, which works quite pleasingly in many cases. The method goes like this:

1. Firstly, guess box 1.

2. If incorrect, try the largest numbered available box that possibly contains the candy.

3. If still wrong, guess the smallest numbered box that may contain the candy.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the candy is found.

To see how this method works in action, let us consider the case of 9 boxes, with the candy in box
8 (see Figure 2 again):

In the first run, the player guesses 1, as stated above. The candy is not in box 1, so everyone replies
CLOSER.

The player then guess 9, the largest numbered remaining box. Since box 8 is closer to 9 than to 1,
the students reply CLOSER again. This leaves only two possibly correct boxes: 6 and 8.

Now the guesser tries the smallest numbered available box, 6. But alas, the candy is not there. This
time the guess is farther away from the correct box than before (


2 vs. 1).

After three guesses the guesser is sure that the candy is in box 8. The game ends after the box is
opened, and now he can finally enjoy his candy!

Now your job is to write a program that imitates the above process.

## Output

```
Each input file contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts on a new line.

Every line of the input contains two integers n and m (1  m  n  100), which denote the number
of boxes and the location of the candy respectively. In all cases n will be a square number.
