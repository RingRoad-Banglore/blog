## Input

```
It is common knowledge that the Solar System consists of the sun at its center and nine planets moving
around the sun on elliptical orbits. Less well known is the fact that the planets orbits are not at all
arbitrary. In fact, the orbits obey three laws discovered by Johannes Kepler. These laws, also called
The Laws of Planetary Motion, are the following.

1. The orbits of the planets are ellipses, with the sun at one focus of the ellipse. (Recall that the
two foci of an ellipse are such that the sum of the distances to them is the same for all points on
the ellipse.)

2. The line joining a planet to the sun sweeps over equal areas during equal time intervals as the
planet travels around the ellipse.

3. The ratio of the squares of the revolutionary periods of two planets is equal to the ratio of the
cubes of their semi major axes.

By Keplers first law, the path of the planet shown
in the figure on the left is an ellipse. According to
Keplers second law, if the planet goes from M to N
in time tA and from P to Q in time tB and if tA =
tB, then area A equals area B. Keplers third law is
illustrated next.

Consider an ellipse whose center is at the
origin 0 and that is symmetric with respect to
the two coordinate axes. The x-axis intersects
the ellipse at points A and B and the y-axis
intersects the ellipse at points C and D. Set
a = 1

|AB| and b = 1

|CD|. Then the ellipse

= 1. If

a  b, AB is called the major axis, CD the
minor axis, and OA (with length a) is called
the semimajoraxis. When two planets are re-
volving around the sun in times t1 and t2 re-
spectively, and the semi major axes of their or-
bits have lengths a1 and a2, then according to
Keplers third law ( t1

In this problem, you are to compute the location of a planet using Keplers laws. You are given
the description of one planet in the Solar System (i.e., the length of its semi-major axis, semi-minor
axis, and its revolution time) and the description of a second planet (its semi-major axis and semi-
minor axis). Assume that the second planets orbit is aligned with the coordinate axes (as in the above
figure), that it moves in counter clockwise direction, and that the sun is located at the focal point with
non-negative x-coordinate. You are to compute the position of the second planet a specified amount of
time after it starts at the point with maximal x-coordinate on its orbit (point B in the above figure).

## Output

```
The input file contains several descriptions of pairs of planets. Each line contains six integers
a1, b1, t1, a2, b2, t. The first five integers are positive, and describe two planets as follows:

a1 = semi major axis of the first planets orbit
b1 = semi minor axis of the first planets orbit
t1 = period of revolution of the first planet (in days)
a2 = semi major axis of the second planets orbit
b2 = semi minor axis of the second planets orbit

The non-negative integer t is the time (in days) at which you have to determine the position of the
second planet, assuming that the planet starts in position (a2, 0).

The last description is followed by a line containing six zeros.

## Sample Input

```
For each pair of planets described in the input, produce one line of output. For each line, print the
number of the test case. Then print the x- and y-coordinates of the position of the second planet after
t days. These values must be exact to three digits to the right of the decimal point. Follow the format
of the sample output provided below.
