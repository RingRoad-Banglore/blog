## Input

```
In graph theory. the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two distinct nodes v and w in a rooted tree
is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants, where we define each node to
be a descendant of itself (so if v has a direct connection from w, w is the lowest common ancestor).

For example, on the above tree (depicted from case 1) LCA(3, 5) = 1, LCA(7, 10) = 5, LCA(6, 5) =
5, etc.

In this problem, given a Forest, i.e. a disjoint union of rooted trees, you have to find out for each
node u how many distinct pair of nodes (v, w) exist such that LCA(v, w) would be u. You should
assume that both (v, w) and (w, v) are same pair.
```

## Output

```
First line of input file contains number of test cases, T  100 and T cases follow. Each case starts with
an integer N (1  N  10000), number of nodes in the forest. Next line contains N integers, p1, p2,
, pN (0  pi  N), where pi is the parent of i-th (1  i  N) node in a rooted tree of the forest. If
pi = 0 then node i is a root in rooted tree.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the forest number starting from 1 and number of LCA pair for each node (ordered
by node number) separated by space. See the sample output for exact formatting.

Output Explanation
In case 2, in the given forest among the two trees rooted at 2 and 3, there is no pair for which

LCA is 1 or 3. For pair (1, 2) LCA is 2. So, total pair for 2 is 1.
In case 3, for pair (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) LCA is 1. For only pair (2,3) LCA is 2. There is

no pair for which LCA is 3 or 4.
