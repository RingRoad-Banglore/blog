## Input

```text
Ampang Communications & Mobile (ACM) provides telecom services for var-
ious types of users. Since the people of Ampang are quite talkative, they are
always seeking for packages that are best suited for them. To have an edge
over their competitors, ACM provides various packages. Two of the most
popular packages are:

 Mile

 Juice

Mile charges every 30 seconds at a rate of 10 cents. That means if you
talk for 29 seconds or less, you will be charged with 10 cents. If you talk for
30 to 59 seconds, you will be charged with 20 cents and so on.

Juice charges every 60 seconds at a rate of 15 cents. That means if you
talk for 59 seconds or less, you will be charged with 15 cents. Similarly, if you
talk for 60 seconds to 119 seconds, you will be charged with 30 cents and so
on.

Given a list of call durations, can you determine the package that is cheaper?
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 50) that denotes the total number of test cases. Each case
starts with a line containing an integer N (0 < N < 20). The next line gives a list of N call durations
(In second). Each call duration is an integer in the range [1, 2000]. Consecutive integers are separated
by a single space character.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output the case number first. Then output the name of the cheaper package followed by
the corresponding cost in cents. If both package gives the same total cost, then output both the names
(Mile preceding Juice) followed by the cost. Look at the output for sample input for details.

Illustration
Case 1: Mile(30+10=40) & Juice(30+15=45).
Case 2: Mile(20+20+20=60) & Juice(15+15+15=45).
Case 3: Mile(30+30=60) & Juice(30+30=60).
