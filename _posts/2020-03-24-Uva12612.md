title: Uva 12612  Cube Killer
---


## Input

```text
The world is facing a great crisis. The ancient prophecy is true. The Giant Cube is on its way to
destroy earth. As a brilliant programmer, you have to develop a small module for the Cube-Killer
Super Computer. This problem describes the task of that module.

For this problem, you will be given a list of three dimensional points with integer coordinates. You
have to calculate the side-length of the smallest cube such that, the cube is axis parallel and all
of the given points lie on its surface.

Notes:

 A cube is a solid shape, bounded by six equal squares, the angle between any two adjacent faces
being a right angle.

 A point lies on the surface of a cube if the point doesnt lie strictly inside the cube and the
distance from the point to at least one of the faces of the cube is zero.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains an integer T (T < 101) that denotes the number of test cases. The first line
of each test case contains N (2  N  20000), the number of points to be processed. Each of the
following N lines contains three space separated integers x y z denoting the co-ordinates of a point in
three dimensions. The absolute value of x, y and z doesnt exceed 1000000000 (109). All the points
will be distinct.

Input file is huge please use faster input and output methods (e.g. printf and scanf in C++).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input, print the output in the format, Case X: Y  (here, X is the serial of the input and
Y is the answer). If there is no cube such that all of the given points lie on its surface then print -1,
otherwise print the side length of the smallest such cube.

```
