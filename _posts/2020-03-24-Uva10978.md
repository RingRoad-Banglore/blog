## Input

```text
You have seen a card magic trick named Spelling Bee. The process goes as follows:

1. The magician first arranges 13 cards in a circle, as shown in the figure below.

2. Starting from the marked position, he counts the cards clockwisely, saying ACE.

3. He turns the card at the E position, and... it is an Ace!

4. Next, he takes away the Ace and continues to count the cards, saying TWO.

5. He turns over the card at position O ... it is a Two!!

6. He continues to do this with the rest of the cards from Three to King. :-)

Now, how does the magician arrange the cards?

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. Each case begins with an integer N (1  N  52), the number of
cards to be used in the magic trick. The following N lines show the order of the turning-over of the
cards and the words to be spelt. None of the words will have more than 20 characters. The format for
each card is a string with two characters: first the value, and second the suit.

Input ends with a test case where N = 0. This test case should not be processed.
