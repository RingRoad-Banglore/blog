```
This program should search for strings in an N by N array of characters. In the context of this problem,
a character is any printable ASCII character (ASCII values 32 thru 126, inclusive).
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer on a line by itself containing the number of datasets, followed by a blank
line. Each dataset contains the following:

 line 1: the value of N ( 50),

 lines 2 to N + 1: N -character-long strings, possibly including blanks, (However please note that
since some PC editors automatically truncate trailing blanks, none of the lines in the input file
will contain trailing blanks. That is, every line will end with some non-blank character. Leading
and imbedded blanks are permissible.)

 lines N + 2 through end of file: strings 1 to N characters long, containing no blanks.

Lines 2 through N + 1 of the file represent the contents of the N by N array, line 2 for row 1, line
3 for row 2, etc.

For Line N + 2 and after, you are to determine each (and every) position at which the string
appears in the array. Appears means that the first character of the string matches the character at
the position, and that subsequent characters in the string match the characters in the array (skipping
over any blanks in the array) going in any of the eight possible directions E (right), NE (diagonally up
and right), N (up), NW (diagonally up and left), W (left), SW (diagonally down and left), S (down), and
SE (diagonally down and right). The string you are looking for may not wrap around from one edge
of the array to another.

```

## Output

```
The output for each string in each dataset will be:

 a blank line

 the string itself

 Either the message not found
OR
A listing of every starting position and direction at which the string is found, using the format:
(row,column) - dir [for example, (5,3) - NW]

If the string appears more than once, you must report each occurrence. The order in which you
have to output multiple occurrences is: first by increasing row number, second by increasing column
number when same row and finally (when both row and column are equal) by direction in clockwise
order, beginning with the North.

Print an extra blank line between datasets.
