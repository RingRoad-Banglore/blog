title: Uva 10423  Peter Takes a Tramway
---


## Input

```
Main Town has a well-developed system of tramway network. Since most of the important buildings in
town are located along the Main Street, almost all the tramways pass through the street. All the stops
along the Main Street, and there are very many of them, are numbered with numbers: 0, 1, 2 and so
on. All the tramways enter the Main Street at the stop numbered 0 and continue towards the higher
numbered stops. For each tramway line, which is identified also by a number, there is a schedule posted
at stop 0 giving the minutes within an hour when a tramway of this line leaves the stop.

Peter arrives at stop 0 at m minutes (0  m < 60) after an hour and takes the first tramway that
leaves stop 0 along the Main Street. If Peter arrives at stop 0 the same minute when a tram leaves,
Peter manages to board the tram. He leaves the tram at the next stop and takes the next tram that
arrives and continues to the next stop where he leaves. Peter continues in this fashion until he reaches
stop 0 < n < 1000000000. By which tram will Peter arrive at stop n?
```

## Output

```
Input contains multiple cases. The first line of a case gives t, the number of tramway lines, 0 < t < 30.
The next t lines each contain a number of a tram line followed by a colon and then a list (separated
by spaces) of minutes after a full hour when the tram of this line leaves stop 0. Each list of departure
times is terminated by -1. No tram leaves stop 0 more than 20 times in an hour, no two trams leave
station 0 at the same time, all the trams have the same speed and they never meet at a stop. A line
with m and n then follows. The input ends with a line where t = 0. This line should not be processed.

## Sample Input

arrives at stop n.
