title: Uva 10876  Factory Robot
---


```
In a factory hall (size 1000  1000 meters) there are a number of circular pillars having various radii.
The pillars dont touch each other or the walls. The company owning the factory is planning to buy
a guard robot, which is to move around in the hall. In the four corners of the hall there are machines
which the guard robot must be able to reach by zigzagging between the pillars and the walls (the
machines themselves are no obstacles).

All guard robots available for sale are also circular. Before the company decides which robot to
buy, they want to find out the maximum radius size it can have, so that it is still able to reach all four
machines.

No part of the robot may extend outside the hall. If the robot has radius r, then it must be able
to reach the coordinates (r, r), (1000  r, r), (r, 1000  r) and (1000  r, 1000  r), from where it can
reach the four machines. The diameter of the robot must be less than the shortest distance between a
pillar and a corner.
```

## Input

```
The first line in the input contains the number of test cases (at most 20). Each case starts with
a line containing a single integer N , the number of pillars (1  N  200). Then follows N lines.
Each such line contains three integers x, y and r: the coordinates (x, y) and radius (r) of a pillar
(1 < x, y < 999, 1  r  499).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line containing a single floating point value: the maximum radius of the
guard robot. The number should be printed with exactly three decimal digits (rounded correctly).
