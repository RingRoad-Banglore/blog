title: Uva 00255  Correct Move
---


```
We have a square board with 64 places, numbered from 0 to 63, see Figure 1.

There are two pieces: A king and a queen. The pair of kings place and queens place is called the
state. A state is legal if the pieces are not at the same place. The king and queen move alternatingly.
The king can move one step in a horizontal or vertical direction, as long as it does not arrive at the
place of the queen. The queen can move one ore more steps in a horizontal or vertical direction, as long
as it does not encounter the king. All these moves are called legal. Please note that the pieces may not
move diagonally.

Figure 1.

For example, suppose we have a state with a king at place 17 and a queen at place 49, as in Figure
2. The legal moves of the king are to places 9, 16, 18, and 25 and the queen can legally move to place
25, 33, 41, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, or 57. We impose, however, an extra restriction: A piece may not
move to a place where the other one can also move to. Legal moves satisfying this restriction are called
allowed. In Figure 2, all possible places the king and the queen can move to by an allowed move, are
denoted with a circle () and a dot (), respectively. In Figure 3, the king cannot move, it is locked in.

This problem requires you to write a program that does some checking related to the movement of
the queen.

## Input

```
The input for your program resides in a textfile that ends with the standard end-of-file marker. Each
line ends with the standard end-of-line marker and contains a sequence of three integers in the range
O..63, separated by one space. The first two integers denote the place of the king and the queen,
respectively. Together they form a state. The third integer denotes a new place for the queen. You
may think of it as computed by some function movequeen. Your program determines whether:

 the given state is legal

 the queens move is legal

 the queens move is allowed.

Furthermore, if these requirements are met, your program determines whether the move of the queen
results in a state where the king is locked in.

```

## Output

```
The output is also a textflle. For each input line, your program produces one output line with one of
the following messages:

 Illegal state

 Illegal move

 Move not allowed

 Continue

 Stop

Illegal state indicates that the given state is not legal, i.e. the pieces are at the same place.
Illegal move means that the given state is legal, but the queens move is illegal.
Move not allowed applies if both the given state and the queens move are legal, but the queens

move is not allowed.
Both Continue and Stop mean that the given state is legal and the queens move is allowed. If

the king can do an allowed move in the resulting state, the message is Continue, otherwise the king
is locked in and you reply Stop.
