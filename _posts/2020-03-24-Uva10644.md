title: Uva 10644  Floor Tiles
---


## Input

```text
Jack is building a new house. He would like to tile his kitchen with congruent pieces
formed by removing a 11 square from a 22 square.

He already knows that his kitchen will have length between L1 and L2 inclusive,
and its width will be between W1 and W2 inclusive. Jack insists his kitchen to be
a perfect rectangle. Of course, the floor must be tiled completely using these pieces
(no overlaps, no spaces).

Determine the number of dimensions for Jacks Kitchen.
```

## Output

```text
You will be given K, the number of test cases. The next K lines will contain four positive integers
separated by spaces: L1 L2 W1 W2, all of which are less than 1000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case you are to output a single line containing the number of different dimensions for
Jacks Kitchen. A 21 kitchen is different from a 12 kitchen.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
2 2 2 3
2 3 3 4

```
