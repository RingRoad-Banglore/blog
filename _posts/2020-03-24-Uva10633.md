title: Uva 10633  Rare Easy Problem
---


## Input

```text
N is a random number, which for some reason, is at least two digits. John Doe, a nondescript man,
performs an operation on N : he chops off the last digit to form a new number M , and then finds
NM . This excites him in a hard-to-justify way. He then tells you NM . Thrilled by the fascinating
back-story behind this number, you make it your life goal to figure out what N was.

By the way, John was later eaten by a tiger.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of multiple lines, one line per case. Each line contains a single positive integer between
10 and 1018 inclusive, giving the value of N M . Input is terminated by a line containing 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print one line containing the possible values of N in sorted order. Separate consecutive
numbers with a single space.

```

## Sample Output

```text
18
0

```
