title: Uva 01029  Heliport
---


## Input

```text
In these fast-paced times, companies are investing in heliports to reduce
travel time for their busy executives. The heliports are typically circular
landing pads, constructed on the roofs of the companies headquarters.

You must write a program that finds the largest radius for a circular
heliport that can be constructed on the flat roof of a building that is in
the form of a simple polygon. Since this is merely the design phase of
the construction effort, your program must find only the radius of the
heliport. The maximum radius for a heliport in the diagram shown is
10.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line consists
of an even integer n (4  n  20), which is the number of the sides of the building. The second line
consists of n pairs of the form (m, d), where m is an integer (1  m  50) and d is a letter (U, R, D, L).
Assuming the roof is drawn on the Cartesian plane, m is the length of a roof boundary segment and
d is the direction of that segment as you travel counterclockwise around the roof. U, R, D, and L
mean Up, Right, Down, and Left respectively. The boundary segments of the roof, which are
parallel to the x and y axes, are given in counterclockwise order. The starting position is the origin (0,
0).

Input for the last test case is followed by a line consisting of the number 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output consists of a separate line containing the case number (starting with
1) and a real number (rounded to two digits after the decimal point) representing the radius of the
heliport. Print a blank line between cases as shown in the sample output.
