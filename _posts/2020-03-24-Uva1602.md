title: Uva 01602  Lattice Animals
---


```

Lattice animal is a set of connected sites on a lattice. Lattice animals on a square lattice are especially
popular subject of study and are also known as polyominoes. Polyomino is usually represented as a set
of sidewise connected squares. Polyomino with n squares is called n-polyomino.

In this problem you are to find a number of distinct free n-polyominoes that fit into rectangle
wh. Free polyominoes can be rotated and flipped over, so that their rotations and mirror images are
considered to be the same.

For example, there are 5 different pentominoes (5-polyominoes) that fit into 2  4 rectangle and 3
different octominoes (8-polyominoes) that fit into 3 3 rectangle.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, one per line. This line consists of 3 integer numbers n, w,
and h (1  n  10, 1  w, h  n).

```

## Output

```
For each one of the test cases, write to the output file a single line with a integer number  the number
of distinct free n-polyominoes that fit into rectangle w  h.
