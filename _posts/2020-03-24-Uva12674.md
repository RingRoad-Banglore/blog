title: Uva 12674  Go up the Ultras
---


## Input

```

The topographic prominence of a peak is a measure of special interest to mountain climbers and can be
defined as follows: the prominence of a peak p with altitude h, relative to the sea level, is the greatest
d such that any path on the terrain from p to any strictly higher peak will pass through a point of
altitude h  d. If there is no strictly higher peak, then the prominence is h itself. Those peaks with
topographic prominence greater than or equal to 150000 centimeters (precision is of great importance
to climbers!) have a special name: they are called Ultras.

You have to write a program that identifies all the Ultras that occur in a two dimensional profile
of a mountain range represented as a sequence of points. Note that the horizontal distance between
points is not important; all that you need is the altitude of each point. In the picture below, the Ultras
are the points 7, 12, 14, 20 and 23.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line contains an integer N (3  N  105) representing the number of points in the profile.
The second line contains N integers Hi indicating the altitudes (in centimeters) of the points, in the
order in which they appear in the profile (0  Hi  106 for i = 1, 2, . . . , N). Consecutive points have
different altitudes (Hi = Hi+1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , N  1), while the first and the last points are at sea level
(H1 = HN = 0). You may assume that the profile contains at least one Ultra.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a line with the indices of all the Ultras in the mountain range, in the order
in which they appear in the profile.
