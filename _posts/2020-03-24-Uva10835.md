```
Jack and Jill like to play with coins. They are interested in the patterns generated after n times flip of
a coin. As you know, in case of a fair coin if you flip the coin 3 times, you can get either of the following
patterns.

HHH THH
HHT THT
HTH TTH
HTT TTT

The numbers of different patterns increase exponentially with the increase of number of flips. Jack
and Jill categorizes all the patterns considering the sub-patterns they have

H HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT
HH HHH, HHT, THH
HT HHT, HTH, HTT, THT
TTH TTH

It is not always possible to examine each pattern. So, some intelligent technique is necessary to do
such task. The problem you need solve for Jack and Jill is to find the probability of getting patterns
which will not contain any of the previously defined sub-patterns.
```

## Input

```
Each test case starts with a positive integer N (1  N  50) which means the number of flips and K
(0  K  50) indicating the number of sub-patterns. Nest K lines will contain the sub-patterns which
will be a sequence of H and T . All sub-patterns have same length and it will be at most 10. Input is
terminated by N = K = 0. This case should not be processed. There can be at most 100 test cases.

```

## Output

```
Output of each test case should consist of a line starting with Case #: where # is the test case
number. It should be followed by the probability of getting patterns which will not contain any of the
given K sub-patterns. If the probability is non-zero, then print it in the form of a/b where a, b are
properly reduced. If the probability is zero, then print 0 simply.
