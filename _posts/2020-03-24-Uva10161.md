title: Uva 10161  Ant on a Chessboard
---


```
One day, an ant called Alice came to an M*M chessboard. She wanted to go around all the grids. So
she began to walk along the chessboard according to this way: (you can assume that her speed is one
grid per second)

At the first second, Alice was standing at (1,1). Firstly she went up for a grid, then a grid to the
right, a grid downward. After that, she went a grid to the right, then two grids upward, and then two
grids to the left in a word, the path was like a snake.

For example, her first 25 seconds went like this:
( the numbers in the grids stands for the time when she went into the grids)

25 24 23 22 21 5
10 11 12 13 20 4
9 8 7 14 19 3
2 3 6 15 18 2
1 4 5 16 17 1
1 2 3 4 5

At the 8-th second , she was at (2,3), and at 20-th second, she was at (5,4).
Your task is to decide where she was at a given time (you can assume that M is large enough).
```

## Input

```
Input file will contain several lines, and each line contains a number N (1  N  2  109), which stands
for the time. The file will be ended with a line that contains a number 0.

```

## Output

For each input situation you should print a line with two numbers (x,y), the column and the row
number, there must be only a space between them.
