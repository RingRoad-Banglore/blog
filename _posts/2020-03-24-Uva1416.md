title: Uva 01416  Warfare And Logistics

## Input

```

The army of United Nations launched a new wave of air strikes on terrorist forces. The objective of
the mission is to reduce enemys logistical mobility. Each air strike will destroy a path and therefore
increase the shipping cost of the shortest path between two enemy locations. The maximal damage is
always desirable.

Lets assume that there are n enemy locations connected by m bidirectional paths, each with specific
shipping cost. Enemys total shipping cost is given as

c =

n
i=1

n
j=1

path(i, j)

Here path(i, j) is the shortest path between locations i and j. In case i and j are not connected,
path(i, j) = L. Each air strike can only destroy one path. The total shipping cost after the strike is
noted as c. In order to maximized the damage to the enemy, UNs air force try to find the maximal
c  c.
```

## Output

```
The first line of each input case consists of three integers: n, m, and L. 1 < n  100, 1  m  1000,
1  L  108. Each of the following m lines contains three integers: a, b, s, indicating length of the
path between a and b.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the total shipping cost before the air strike and the maximal total shipping cost
after the strike. Output them in one line separated by a space.

```

## Sample Output

```

1 3 2

1 4 4

2 1 3

2 3 3

3 4 1

4 2 2
