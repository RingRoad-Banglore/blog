title: Uva 11548  Blackboard Bonanza
---


```
Alice and Bob both have lots of candies but want more. They decide to play the following turn-based
game.

First they write some words on a few pieces of paper and put them into a bag so they cannot see
the words. Next they decide whose turn is first. The first turn begins with the first player drawing and
keeping a piece of paper with the word A from the bag and copying A onto a blackboard evenly spaced.

Then the second player draws and keeps a piece of paper with the word B on it. The current player
is to write B on the blackboard underneath A evenly spaced. The second player receives one candy
from the first for each character that matches vertically between A and B.

Now it is the first players turn who similarly draws and places word C underneath B and gains a
candy for each of the characters vertically matched between B and C. The game continues until there
are no more words in the bag.

What is the maximum number of candies that one of Alice and Bob can possibly get in a turn?

The game on the second blackboard awards the second player one candy.
The game on the third blackboard awards the second player two candies.

## Input

```

starts with an integer n (2  n  70), the number of words in the bag. Then follow n lines containing
one word each (in no particular order). Each word will contain between 1 and 70 characters, all of them
uppercase letters of English alphabet.
