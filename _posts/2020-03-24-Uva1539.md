## Input

```

A polynomial p(x) of degree n can be used to approximate a function f(x) by setting the coeficients of
p(x) to match the first n coeficients of the power series of f(x) (expanded about x = 0). For example,

1

(1 x)
 1 + x+ x2 + . . .+ xn

Unfortunately, polynomials are nice and they do not work well when they are used to approxi-
mate functions that behave poorly (e.g. those with singularities). To overcome this problem, we can
instead approximate functions by rational functions of the form p(x)/q(x), where p(x) and q(x) are
polynomials. You have been asked by Approximate Calculation Machinery to solve this problem, so
they can incorporate your solution into their approximate calculation software.

Given m, n, and the first m + n coeficients of the power series of f(x), we wish to compute two
polynomials p(x) and q(x) of degrees at most m 1 and n 1, respectively, such that the power series
expansion of q(x)f(x)p(x) has 0 as its first m+n1 coefficients, and 1 as its coefficient corresponding
to the xm+n1 term. In other words, we want to find p(x) and q(x) such that

q(x)  f(x) p(x) = xm+n1 + . . .

where . . . contains terms with powers of x higher than m+n1. From this, f(x) can be approximated
by p(x)/q(x).

Background Definitions

A polynomial p(x) of degree n can be written as p0+p1x+p2x
2+ . . .+pnx

n, where pis are integers
in this problem.

A power series expansion of f(x) about 0 can be written as f0 + f1x + f2x
2 + . . ., where fis are

integers in this problem.

## Output

```
The input will consist of multiple cases. Each case will be specified on one line, in the form
m n f0 f1 . . . fm+n1 where fi is the coefficient of x

i in the power series expansion of f . You may
assume that 1  m, 1  n  4, 2  m + n  10, and fi are integers such that |fi|  5. The end of
input will be indicated by a line containing m = n = 0, and no coefficients for f . You may assume that
there is a unique solution for the given input.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print two lines of output. Print the polynomial p(x) on the first line, and then q(x)
on the second line. The polynomial p(x) should be printed as a list of pairs (pi, i) arranged in ascending
order in i, such that pi is a non-zero coefficient for the term x

i. Each non-zero coefficient pi should be
printed as a/b, where b > 0 and a/b is the coefficient expressed in lowest terms. In addition, if b = 1
then print only a (and omit b). If p(x) = 0, print a line containing only (0,0). Separate the pairs in
the list by one space. The polynomial q(x) should be printed in the same manner. Insert a blank line
between cases.
