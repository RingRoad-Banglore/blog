10988 From G to H and back
“All right, I’m stumped... and I think I’m supposed to be.”

Dana Scully

There is a funny transformation that you can do with a graph. We start with an undirected graph,
G, and build a new graph, H. G has n vertices and m edges. For each edge in G, we create a vertex
in H. Two vertices in H are connected by an edge if and only if their corresponding edges in G share a
vertex. H will have m vertices and p edges.

That’s easy. But what about reconstructing G, given H?

## Input
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with two lines
containing m (at most 320) and p. p lines follow, each containing two different vertices (numbered from
1 to m) in H which are connected by an edge.

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing ‘Case #x:’ followed by either ‘yes’ or ‘no’, depending
on whether there exists some graph G that produces the given graph H.

## Sample Input
<p>2</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>1 2</p><p>2 3</p><p>3 1</p><p>4</p><p>3</p><p>1 2</p><p>1 3</p><p>1 4</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>Case #1: yes</p><p>Case #2: no</p>
