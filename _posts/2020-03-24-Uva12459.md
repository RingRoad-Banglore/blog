title: Uva 12459  Bees ancestors
---


```
Maya is a bee that likes to help her friends.
Willy is a drone bee and Mayas best friend.
He has just discovered that he has no father,
and he is worried about that.

Maya knows that female bees have two par-
ents (one father and one mother), but male or
drone bees have a mother but no father. This is
because if an egg is laid by an unmated female,
it hatches a drone bee, but if, instead, an egg
was fertilized by a male, it hatches a female.

After Maya talks with Willy about this, he
begins to think about the number of ances-
tors that he has. He has one mother. He
also has two grandparents (one grandmother
and one grandfather). And he has three great-
grandparents. Since Willy is very lazy, he doesnt want to perform more calculations and he is asking
you to write a program that, given a number of generation, determines how many of Willys ancestors
belong to that generation, under the assumption that the ancestors at each level are unrelated.
```

## Input

```
Your program receives a sequence of positive integers, one per line, each representing the generation.
The maximum value for the generation is 80. The input terminates with a 0.

```

## Output

```
For each input case, your program must print the corresponding number of ancestors that Willy has in
such generation.

```

## Sample Input

```
1
2
3
0

```

## Sample Output

```
1
2
3
```
