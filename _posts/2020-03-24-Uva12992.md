title: Uva 12992  Huatuos Medicine

## Input

```text
Huatuo was a famous doctor. He use identical bottles to carry the medicine. There are different types
of medicine. Huatuo put medicines into the bottles and chain these bottles together.

However, there was a critical problem. When Huatuo arrived the patients home, he took the
chain out of his bag, and he could not recognize which bottle contains which type of medicine, but he
remembers the order of the bottles on the chain.

Huatuo has his own solution to resolve this problem. When he need to bring 2 types of medicines,
E.g. A and B, he will put A into one bottle and put B into two bottles. Then he will chain the bottles
in the order of -B-A-B-. In this way, when he arrived the patients home, he knew that the bottle in
the middle is medicine A and the bottle on two sides are medicine B.

Now you need to help Huatuo to work out whats the minimal number of bottles needed if he want
to bring N types of medicine.
