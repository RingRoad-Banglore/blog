## Input

```text
A well-known trick to know if an integer N is a multiple of nine is to compute the sum S of its digits.
If S is a multiple of nine, then so is N . This is a recursive test, and the depth of the recursion needed
to obtain the answer on N is called the 9-degree of N .

Your job is, given a positive number N , determine if it is a multiple of nine and, if it is, its 9-degree.
```

## Output

```text
The input is a file such that each line contains a positive number. A line containing the number 0 is
the end of the input. The given numbers can contain up to 1000 digits.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output of the program shall indicate, for each input number, if it is a multiple of nine, and in case
it is, the value of its nine-degree. See the sample output for an example of the expected formatting of
the output.

```

## Sample Output

```text
