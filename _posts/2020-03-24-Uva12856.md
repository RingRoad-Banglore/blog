title: Uva 12856  Counting substhreengs
---


## Input

```
Substrings are strings formed by choosing a subset of contiguous characters from a string. This is well
known. A little more obscure is the definition of substhreengs. A substhreeng is a substring which
complies to the following additional requirements:

1. It is non-empty, and composed entirely of base 10 digits.

2. Interpreted in base 10 (allowing extra leading zeros), the resulting integer is a multiple of 3.

For instance, the string 130a303 contains 9 substhreengs: the substhreeng 3 three times, the
substhreengs 30 and 0 twice each, and the substhreengs 303 and 03 once each. The substring
30a3 is not a substhreeng because it is not composed entirely of base 10 digits, while the substring
13 is not a substhreeng because 13 is not a multiple of 3.

Notice that two substhreengs are considered different if they are different in length or start at a
different position, even if the selected characters are the same.

Given a string, you are asked to count the number of substhreengs it contains.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases; each test case is formatted as follows. A test case consists of a
single line that contains a non-empty string S of at most 106 characters. Each character of S is either
a digit or a lowercase letter.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input, output a line with an integer representing the number of substhreengs
contained in S.

```

## Sample Output

```
130a303
