The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists two integers n (1  n  24) and x
(0  x < 150). The meanings of n and x are given in the problem statement. Input is terminated by a
case where n =0 and x =0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output giving the requested probability as a proper fraction
in lowest terms in the format shown in the sample output. All numbers appearing in output are
representable in unsigned 64-bit integers. The last line of input contains two zeros and it should not
be processed.
