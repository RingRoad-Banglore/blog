## Input

```text
I have a friend named Hippo. Hippo is my
best friend. Whenever I am happy I call hippo.
Whenever I am sad I call hippo. I call hippo
even if I am not happy or sad. Hippo means a
lot to me. So if hippo is in some sort of trouble
and asks me for help I would do anything to
solve that problem.

You might find it interesting that hippo is
a very good programmer too. Hippo likes to
solve difficult and challenging problems. We
have been solving problems from the beginning
of our friendship. So if anyone is facing some
difficulties getting Accepted in some problem
the other person always tries to help.

Yesterday, hippo gave me a code and asked
me if the code is alright. Hippo told me that
the code was getting the verdict Time limit ex-
ceeded again and again. So I asked about the problem. Let me tell you the problem exactly like hippo
described:

An integer N is given. You need to find out how many numbers I (1  I  N) are there such that
GCD(I,N)  X. Here GCD means greatest common divisor.

Now being super busy with your contest, I have no time to help my friend. But I cant let hippo feel
helpless with any problem. So can you please help hippo and save our friendship?
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input is an integer T (1  T  10), which is the number of test cases. Each case starts
with two integers N (0 < N  1012) and Q (0 < Q  50, 000). After that Q lines follow, each with a
value of X, which will be a 64 bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case print a line Case C (without the quotes), where C is the case number. After that for
each X print a line with the value R, where there are R positive numbers less than or equal to N such
that their GCD is less than or equal to X.

Explanation of 1st Sample Input
For 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 the GCD with 30 is 1.
For 2, 4, 8, 14, 16, 22, 26, 28 the GCD with 30 is 2.
GCD (30,15) = 15. All the other values have GCD  10.
