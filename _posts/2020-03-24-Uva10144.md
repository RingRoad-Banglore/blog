## Input

```
It is known that Sheffer stroke function (NOT-AND) can be used to construct any Boolean function.
The truth table for this function is given below:

Truth table for Sheffer stroke function
x y x | y
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 0

Consider the problem of adding two binary numbers A and B, each containing N bits. The individual
bits of A and B are numbered from 0 (the least significant) to N  1 (the most significant). The sum
of A and B can always be represented by N + 1 bits. Lets call most significant bit of the sum (bit
number N) the overflow bit.

Your task is to construct a logical expression using the Sheffer stroke function that computes the
value of the overflow bit for arbitrary values of A and B. Your expression shall be constructed according
to the following rules:

1. Ai is an expression that denotes value of i-th bit of number A.

2. Bi is an expression that denotes value of i-th bit of number B.

3. (x|y) is an expression that denotes the result of Sheffer stroke function for x and y, where x and
y are expressions.

When writing the index, i, for bits in A and B, the index shall be written as a decimal number
without leading zeros. For example, bit number 12 of A must be written as A12. The expression should
be completely parenthesized (according to the 3rd rule). No blanks are allowed inside the expression.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer indicating the number of test cases in the input. After
that there is a blank line and the test cases separated by a blank line.

Each test case consists of a single integer N (1  N  100), on a line by itself.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, write to the output file an expression for calculating overflow bit of the addition of
two N -bit numbers A and B according to the rules given in the problem statement.

Print a blank line between test cases.

Note: The stroke symbol (|) is an ASCII character with code 124 (decimal).
