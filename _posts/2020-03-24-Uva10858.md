title: Uva 10858  Unique Factorization
---


## Input

```text
Some of you may have heard the joke about a boy who stopped going to school because he thought that
his teacher was crazy. When his parents asked as to why he felt that way, the boy replied, two days
back, my math teacher said, 12 = 4 3, and yesterday she said 12 = 6 2. How can I trust a teacher
like this who contradicts her own saying?. His parents explained the situation to him, so the boy was
convinced and continued with his studies. Few years later, the boy wonders, how many ways are there
to factorize a number. He sits with pen and paper and discovers that the task is getting quite tedious
for large numbers. So he asks you for help. He wants you to write a program to solve his problem.
```

## Output

```text
The input file will contain at most 20 cases. Each line of input contains a positive integer, N  2000000.
The last case is followed by a value of 0 for N , which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For every case, there will be one or more lines of output. The first line of each set of output should
contain the number F , where F is the number of ways to uniquely factorize N . If F > 0, then the next
F lines should contain the Factorizations of N . The numbers in the factorizations should be sorted in
non-decreasing order and individual factorizations should be sorted in dictionary order. When printing
numbers in a line, there should be a space between each number. See sample output of N = 20
for clarification. Permutations of factorization are considered same. That is, 12 = 4  3 is same as
12 = 3 4.

Note: To limit the answers to finite values, the factorizations should not contain any 1, and there should
be at least two numbers in the factorizations. So for this problem, 20 = 1  20, is not a factorization
of 20.
