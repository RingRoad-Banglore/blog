## Input

```
Once, in one kingdom, there was a queen and that queen was expecting a baby. The queen prayed: If
my child was a son and if only he was a sound king. After nine months her child was born, and indeed,
she gave birth to a nice son.

Unfortunately, as it used to happen in royal families, the son was a little retarded. After many years
of study he was able just to add integer numbers and to compare whether the result is greater or less
than a given integer number. In addition, the numbers had to be written in a sequence and he was able
to sum just continuous subsequences of the sequence.

The old king was very unhappy of his son. But he was ready to make everything to enable his son
to govern the kingdom after his death. With regards to his sons skills he decided that every problem
the king had to decide about had to be presented in a form of a finite sequence of integer numbers and
the decision about it would be done by stating an integer constraint (i.e. an upper or lower limit) for
the sum of that sequence. In this way there was at least some hope that his son would be able to make
some decisions.

After the old king died, the young king began to reign. But very soon, a lot of people became very
unsatisfied with his decisions and decided to dethrone him. They tried to do it by proving that his
decisions were wrong.

Therefore some conspirators presented to the young king a set of problems that he had to decide
about. The set of problems was in the form of subsequences Si = {asi , asi+1, . . . , asi+ni} of a sequence
S = {a1, a2, . . . , an}. The king thought a minute and then decided, i.e. he set for the sum asi + asi+1+
   + asi+ni of each subsequence Si an integer constraint ki (i.e. asi + asi+1 +    + asi+ni < ki or
asi + asi+1 +   + asi+ni > ki resp.) and declared these constraints as his decisions.

After a while he realized that some of his decisions were wrong. He could not revoke the declared
constraints but trying to save himself he decided to fake the sequence that he was given. He ordered
to his advisors to find such a sequence S that would satisfy the constraints he set. Help the advisors of
the king and write a program that decides whether such a sequence exists or not.
```

## Output

```
The input file consists of blocks of lines. Each block except the last corresponds to one set of problems
and kings decisions about them. In the first line of the block there are integers n, and m where
0 < n  100 is length of the sequence S and 0 < m  100 is the number of subsequences Si. Next
m lines contain particular decisions coded in the form of quadruples si, ni, oi, ki, where oi represents
operator > (coded as gt) or operator < (coded as lt) respectively. The symbols si, ni and ki have
the meaning described above. The last block consists of just one line containing 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output file contains the lines corresponding to the blocks in the input file. A line contains text
successful conspiracy when such a sequence does not exist. Otherwise it contains text lamentable
kingdom. There is no line in the output file corresponding to the last null block of the input file.
