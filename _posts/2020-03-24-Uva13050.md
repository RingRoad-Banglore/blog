## Input

```
Given a grid with R rows and C columns, you are currently at (0, 0) and you want to go to the position
(R  1, C  1). You have only two kind of movement allowed. From any position (i, j) you can go to
either (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1). You need to find the number of ways you can go to (R  1, C  1) from
(0, 0). Easy, right? But heres is a slight problem. All the cells are not available all the time. So while
counting the number of ways you need to consider that you can never step into a cell which is not
available right now.
```

## Output

```
First line will contain an integer T (1  T  10), which is the number of test cases. Each case starts
with a line R, C and Q. Here, 1  R,C  1000 and 1  Q  10000. Then, Q queries follow, each with
four integers a, b, c, d. This means the cells inside the rectangle with lower left corner at (a, b) and
upper right corner at (c, d) are not available. All the coordinates are given in row major order with
0-based indexing. The lowermost and leftmost point is considered to be (0, 0).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case print a line Case T , where T is the case number. For each query in a case, print 3
spaces and then Query X: W , where X is query number and W is the number of ways possible for
that particular query. Answer needs to be in modulo 912. Check sample input and output for details.

```

## Sample Output

```
1
5 5 2
1 1 2 2
0 1 2 3

```
