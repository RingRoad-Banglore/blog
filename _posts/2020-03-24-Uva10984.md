Definitions
In this problem, a graph is a set of n vertices together with a set of m edges, where an edge is an

unordered pair of different vertices (edges are undirected). The two vertices that comprise an edge are
said to be that edges endpoints. A vertex cover of a given graph G is a subset C of its vertices, such
that each edge of G has at least one of its endpoints in C. An independent set of a given graph G is a
subset S of its vertices, such that no edge of G has both of its endpoints in S.

The problem of finding a minimum vertex cover (that is, a vertex cover of the smallest possible size)
for any graph is NP-hard. The problem of finding a maximum independent set of any graph is also
NP-hard. That is a formal way of saying that no one knows whether there exists an algorithm that
runs in time polynomial in n and solves any one of the two problems.

We want to define a class of problems that are even harder than the NP-hard problems. We are
going to call them Double NP-hard! Your job is to solve the first Double NP-hard problem.

Problem
Given a graph G, find a subset C of its vertices that is both a minimum vertex cover and a maximum

independent set.

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with two lines
containing n (0  n  1000) and m (0  m  100000) as above. The next m lines will each describe
an edge of G as a pair of different vertices, which are numbered from 1 to n.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by either Impossible if there is
no answer or the size k of the set C. In the latter case, on the next line, print the k vertices of C in
increasing order, separated by spaces. If there are multiple answers, print the lexicographically smallest
one.
