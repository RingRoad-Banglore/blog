Guess the weights of the girls

Some school children discovered that by getting on
a weighing machine in couples, and then exchanging
placesone at a timethey could get the correct weight
of a whole party on the payment of but one cent. They
found that in couples they weighed (in pounds): 129,
125, 124, 123, 122, 121, 120, 118, 116 and 114. What
was the weight of each one of the fve little girls if taken
separately?

It proves that they must have been clever scholars or
they never would have been able to work out the correct
answer to such an interesting puzzle question, which is liable to confuse older heads than theirs.

Given a list of 10 integers, representing the weighs of each couple formed from a group of 5 people,
determine the weights of each person.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases. Each test case is described
by 10 integers W1, W2, , W10 in a single line.

T  3000; 100  W1  W2  . . .  W10  400

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the 5 weights asked, separated by spaces. Print
these numbers in ascending order.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
114 116 118 120 121 122 123 124 125 129
110 111 114 115 118 118 119 122 123 126
180 190 190 196 196 206 216 216 226 232

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 56 58 60 64 65
Case 2: 53 57 58 61 65
Case 3: 90 90 100 106 126
