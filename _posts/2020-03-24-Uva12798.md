title: Uva 12798  Handball

## Input

```text

Frustrated and disappointed with the results of its football team, the Super Brazilian Club (SBC)
decided to invest in the handball team. In order to better rate the players, the coaches would like to
analyse their regularity. Specifically, they are interested in knowing how many players scored goals in
all matches.

As the data volume is very big, they would like to have a computer program to do this counting.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two integers N and M
(1  N  100 and 1  M  100) indicating, respectively, the number of players and the number of
matches. Each one of the next N lines describes the performance of one player: the i-th line contains
M integers Xj (0  Xj  100, for 1  j  M), giving the number of goals that the i-th player scored
in each match.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input your program must output one line, containing one integer, the number
of players that scored goals in all matches!

```
