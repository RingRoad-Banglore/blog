title: Uva 01536  Coins

## Input

```text

Once upon a time the following puzzle was suggested to pupils on a regional middle school olympiad
on mathematics:

 A set of coins consists of 15 coins: 14 coins are valid while a remaining 15-th coin is a false one.
All valid coins have one and the same weight while the false coin has a different weight. One valid
coin is marked. Is it possible to identify a false coin balancing coins 3 times at most?

A jury member was a trainer of a team of undergraduates for programming contests. So a question
on how to put the puzzle for programming arose naturally. Fin ally the problem was formulated as
follows:

 A set of coins consists of N coins: (N  1) coins are valid while a remaining N -th coin is a false
one. All valid coins have one and the same weight while the false coin has a different weight. One
valid coin is marked. Write a program which for every input pair

 a number N of coins under question,

 a limit K of balancing

outputs either POSSIBLE or IMPOSSIBLE with respect to existence of a strategy to identify the false
coin balancing coins K times at most.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains a single integer T that represents a total amount of different pairs (N,K)
to process. Every line of next T lines contains two integers N , 2  N  100 and K, 0  K  100.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output file should contain T lines with POSSIBLE or IMPOSSIBLE per line.

```

## Sample Output
