## Input

```
We define an expression as below:

< expression > := < number > | < expression >+< expression > |
< expression >-< expression > | (< expression >)

where number is defined to be an integer.
In this problem you are given an expression with all its numbers replaced with character x. Then

you are given a set of numbers that were actually in the expression. We know that numbers were placed
in the expression in such a way that the expression evaluates to maximum possible value among all
other placements. Write a program that calculates this maximum value.
```

## Output

```
In the first line there is an integer T (T  100), the number of tests. Each test begins with the
expression itself. Next line is an integer N , the number of numbers in the expression. In the final
line of each test there are N integers ai (|ai|  3000). Each of these numbers should be used in the
expression exactly once. It is guaranteed that the expression can be parsed by the definition in the
problem statement and its length will not exceed 105. There are no whitespaces in the expression and
all numbers are replaced with a single x. The number of xs in the expression is N .

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test output the maximum possible value of the expression in a single line.
