## Input

```text
Tic-Tac-Toe, Awari, Gomoku, Connect Four, Checkers... the list of games that computers have solved
perfectly is ever-increasing. And yet, the most popular game of all remains shrouded in mystery. From
the vast libraries of openings to the crucial final moves, nobody has come close to encoding the complex
strategy required to master this ever-changing game.

I refer, of course, to Rock, Paper, Scissors 
the game that has been responsible for millions of
critical decisions over the course of humankinds
existence! From the aggressive yet vulnerable
Avalanche (three Rocks in a row) to the cautious
but flexible Crescendo (Paper, Scissors, Rock),
the sheer variety of viable strategies in Rock, Pa-
per, Scissors is truly breathtaking.

Asking you to SOLVE the generalized form of
this hallowed game would, of course, be ridiculous;
thousands have been driven mad in the attempt.
Nay, such is not your task. You must merely figure
out how to defeat a single known opponent in fair
Rock-to-Paper-to-Scissors combat.

The tournament you will compete in is similar
to a Tennis match. It is divided into sets, which are themselves divided into G individual games. Each
game consists of one throw of Rock, Paper, Scissors. You and your opponent simultaneously pick one of
Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. The winner
gains one point; if you both pick the same thing, nobody gains a point. Whoever has more points after
the G games wins the set. (Sets may also end in draws.) You will lose the tournament if, at any time,
your opponent has won L more sets than you. Similarly, you will win if, at any time, you have won W
more sets than your opponent. L may be different from W ; this is not necessarily a fair contest!

Your opponents strategy is simple: for each of the G games in a set, he has a fixed probability of
choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. For instance, his strategy might be: for game 1, pick Rock 50% of
the time and Paper 50% of the time; for game 2, always pick Scissors. Figure out your odds of winning
the tournament if you play as well as you possibly can.

## Output

```text
Input will be at most 40 test cases. Each case starts with a line containing three positive integers: G,
W , and L satisfying 1  G  1000, 1  W,L  100. The next G lines contain three integers between
0 and 100 inclusive, giving the percent probability of your opponent choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors
in that game of each set. The three integers will always sum to 100.

Input is terminated by a line containing three zeros.
