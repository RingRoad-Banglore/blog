title: Uva 10218  Lets Dance
---


## Input

```
Consider the following scenario:

You are a University Student; all of your friends consider you courageous, most of the girls find you
handsome, you are quite a good student, recently your team has won a regional contest of ACM ICPC
and so your confidence is very high. In a party you find someone nice and ask her to dance but she
seems smarter than (as always is the case) you. She tells you,

There are M gentle men and W ladies in this party except us. You have C candies in your
hand and you distribute them randomly among all these guests (M men and W ladies), of
course if possible. Now you collect all the candies from all the gentlemen and this number of
candies is CC. If you can evenly distribute these (CC) candies equally between two groups
(These two groups are two arbitrary groups) I will dance with you.

Now tell me what is the probability of her dancing with you.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains three non-negative integers M (M 
1000), W (W  1000) and C (C  100). The meanings of the symbols are explained before. The input
is terminated by a line where M = 0 and W = 0. You need not process this input.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input, you should produce one line of output, which is a floating-point number. This
output is the probability of her dancing with you. The number contains seven digits after the decimal
point. An error less than 2E-7 or 2  107 will be overlooked.

## Sample Output
