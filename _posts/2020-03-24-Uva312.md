## Input

```text
A crossword can be stored as a matrix m n of zeros and ones. Zero represents white squares and one
represents black squares. Some squares of the crossword are numbered and assigned to these numbers
are the descriptions of the words that should be written either across or down into the crossword.
A square is numbered if it is a white square and either (a) the square below it is white and there is no
white square immediately above, or (b) there is no white square immediately to its left and the square
to its right is white. The squares are numbered from left to right, from the top line to the bottom line.

From the matrix a crossword diagram can be drawn. In the diagram each square is represented
by a box 4  6 characters. Black square and white squares (numbered and not numbered square) are
represented as follows (where nnn is the number of the square):

++++++ ++++++ ++++++
++++++ +nnn + + +
++++++ + + + +
++++++ ++++++ ++++++

The remaining characters of the box are spaces. If black squares are given at the edges, they should
be removed from the diagram (see the example). Only use spaces as necessary filling characters. Dont
use any unnecessary spaces at the end of the line.
```

## Output
