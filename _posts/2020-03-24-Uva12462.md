title: Uva 12462  Rectangle
---


```
A histogram is a polygon composed of a sequence of rectangular bars aligned
at a common base line. All bars have equal widths but may have different
integer heights. Additionally, each bar is fully colored with a single color. For
example, the figure below shows the histogram that consists of bars with the
heights 2, 3, 1, 7, 1, 3, 5, measured in units where 1 is the width of each bar.
In this case, every bar is colored with one out of three colors.

There are a lot of rectangles that can be placed inside this histogram
(infinitely many, in fact). We will say that a rectangle is nice if and only if:

 It lies completely inside the histogram.

 It covers one or several regions of positive area for every color in the
histogram (barely touching an area is not enough; the total area covered for each color must be
strictly positive).

Here are some examples of rectangles that are not nice:

The rectangles in the two leftmost figures are not nice because they dont lie completely inside the
histogram. The rectangle in the rightmost figure is not nice because the total white area covered is not
strictly positive, and a nice rectangle must cover a positive area of every color.

On the other hand, here are some examples of nice rectangles:

The area of the nice rectangle in the leftmost figure is 6  1 = 6 square units, the area of the nice
rectangle in the middle figure is 33 = 9 square units and the area of the nice rectangle in the rightmost
figure is 1.8 2.6 = 4.68 square units.

Clearly, the area of the rectangle in the middle figure is largest. In fact, it turns out it doesnt exist
a nice rectangle for this histogram with a larger area!

In this problem, you are given a histogram and your task is to compute the maximum area of all
the possible nice rectangles. By the way, it is not hard to prove that this area will always be an integer.

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases (at most 50).

Each test case is described by several lines. The first line contains two integer N and C, the
number of bars and the total number of colors in the histogram, respectively (1  N  105 and
1  C  min(30, N)).

The following line contains N integers hi, the height of the i-th bar from left to right (1  hi  109).
The following line contains N integers ci, the color of the i-th bar from left to right. Each color is
represented as an integer between 0 and C1, inclusive. You can assume that for each histogram there
will be at least one bar of every color.

The last line of the input contains two zeros and should not be processed.

## Output

```
For each test case, output a single integer on a single line  the area of the largest nice rectangle for
this histogram.
