title: Uva 11239  Open Source

## Input

```text
At an open-source fair held at a major university,
leaders of open-source projects put sign-up sheets on
the wall, with the project name at the top in capital
letters for identification.

Students then signed up for projects using their
userids. A userid is a string of lower-case letters and
numbers starting with a letter.

The organizer then took all the sheets off the wall
and typed in the information.

Your job is to summarize the number of students
who have signed up for each project. Some students
were overly enthusiastic and put their name down sev-
eral times for the same project. Thats okay, but they
should only count once. Students were asked to com-
mit to a single project, so any student who has signed
up for more than one project should not count for any project.

There are at most 10,000 students at the university, and at most 100 projects were advertised.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases, each one ending with a line that starts with the digit 1. The last
test case is followed by a line starting with the digit 0.

Each test case consists of one or more project sheets. A project sheet consists of a line containing
the project name in capital letters, followed by the userids of students, one per line.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a summary of each project sheet. The summary is one line with the name
of the project followed by the number of students who signed up. These lines should be printed in
decreasing order of number of signups. If two or more projects have the same number of signups, they
should be listed in alphabetical order.
