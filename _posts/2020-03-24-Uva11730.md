title: Uva 11730  Number Transformation
---


## Input

```text
You are given an integer number S. You can transform any integer number A to another integer number
B by adding x to A. This x is an integer number which is a prime factor of A (Please note that 1
and A are not being considered as a factor of A). Now, your task is to find the minimum number of
transformations required to transform S to another integer number T .
```

## Output

```text
For each test case, there will be a line with two integers, S (1  S  100) & T (1  T  1000), as
described above. The last test case will be followed by a line with two 0s denoting end of input. This
case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For every test case except the last one, print a line of the form Case X: Y  where X is the serial
number of output (starting from 1). Y is the minimum number of transformations required to transform
S to T . If it is not possible to make T from S with the given rules, Y shall be -1.

Explanation of case 1:
You can make 12 from 6 in 2 steps in this way: 6  9  12.

```

## Sample Output

```text
6 12
6 13
0 0

```
