title: Uva 12133  Walk

```
Alice would like to visit Bob. However, they live in a hilly landscape, and Alice doesnt like to walk in
hills. She has a map of the area, showing the height curves. You have to calculate the total altitude
climbed, and the total altitude descended, for the route which minimizes these numbers. It does not
matter how far she has to walk to achieve this.

Since you dont know what the landscape looks like in between the height curves, you cannot know
exactly how much climb and descent she will actually get in practice, but you should calculate the
minimum possible under optimal conditions based on what you can deduce from the map.

The map is represented as an xy grid. Alice lives in (0, 0), and Bob lives in (100000, 0). The
height curves are represented as polygons, where a polygon cannot intersect itself or another polygon.
Furthermore, neither Alice nor Bob lives exactly on a height curve.

Second test case from sample input (compressed).
```

## Input

```
On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:

 One line with 0  N  2500, the number of height curves.

 One line for each height curve, with 1  Hi  1000 being the height of the curve, 3  Pi  2000
the number of vertices in the polygon, and the vertices x1, y1, , xPi , yPi having integral values
300000  xi, yi  300000.

There will be no more than 200 000 polygon vertices in total in all test cases.

```

## Output

```
Per testcase:

 One line with two numbers: the total altitude climbed and the total altitude descended.
