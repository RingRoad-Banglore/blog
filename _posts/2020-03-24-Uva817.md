## Input

```
The wide dissemination of calculators and computers has its disadvantages. Even students in technical
disciplines tend to exhibit a surprising lack of calculating ability. Accustomed to the use of calculators
and computers, many of them are unable to make calculations like 7* 8 mentally or like 13 * 17 using
pencil and paper. We all know, but who cares?

Professor Bartjens [Willem Bartjens (1569-1638) was the author of Cijferinge, a much used Dutch
textbook on arithmetic. The phrase according to Bartjens (uttered following a calculation) made his
name immortal.] cares. Professor Bartjens is a bit old fashioned. He decided to give his students some
training in calculating without electronic equipment by creating a collection of calculation problems,
(like 2100 - 100 = ). To simplify grading the problems, he constructed them so that almost all of them
had 2000 as an answer. Not all of them, of course. His students would be smart enough to recognize
the pattern, and fill in 2000 everywhere without further thinking.

Unfortunately Professor Bartjens printer driver turned out to be even more old-fashioned than the
professor himself, and it could not interface with his new printer. Inspecting the printed problems, he
soon recognized the pattern: none of the operations was transmitted to the printer. A problem like:
2100-100=
was printed as:
2100100=

Fortunately, all the digits and the equal sign were still printed.
To make this bad situation much worse, Professor Bartjens source file had disappeared. So Professor

Bartjens has another problem: what were his original problems? Given the fact that the answer (most
likely) should be 2000, the line 2100100= could have been any one of the lines:

2100-100=
2*100*10+0=
2*100*10-0=
2*10*0100=
2*-100*-10+0=

Professor Bartjens does remember a few things about how he wrote the problems:

 He is sure that whenever he wrote down a number (other than 0), it would not start with a zero.
So 2*10*0100= could not have been one of his problems.

 He also knows he never wrote the number zero as anything but 0. So he would not have a problem
like 2*1000+000=.

 He used only binary operators, not the unary minus or plus, so 2*-100*-10+0= was not an option
either.

 He used the operators +, - and * only, avoiding the operator / (after all, they were first year
students).

 He knew all problems followed the usual precedence and associativity rules.

You are to help Professor Bartjens recover his problem set by writing a program that when given
a row of digits, insert one or more of the operators +, - and * in such a way that the value of the
resulting expression equals 2000.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 817  According to Bartjens 2/2
```

## Output

```
The input consists of one or more test cases. Each test case is a single line containing n digits (09),
1  n  9, followed by an equal sign. There will not be any blanks embedded in the input, but there
may be some after the equal sign.

The last test case is followed by a line containing only the equal sign. This line should not be
processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the word Problem, then the number of the case, then all possible ways of
inserting operators in the row of digits such that the resulting expression has the value 2000, subject
to Professor Bartjens memory of how he wrote the problems. Use the format shown below. If there is
more than one possible problem, they may be written in any order, but no problem may appear more
than once in the list. Each possible problem should be on a new line, indented 2 spaces. If there is no
solution the answer IMPOSSIBLE should be printed, indented 2 spaces.

## Sample Output

2100100=
