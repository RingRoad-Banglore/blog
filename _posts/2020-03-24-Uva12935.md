title: Uva 12935  Graph Guessing
---


```
There is a strongly-connected graph (i.e. you can reach any node from any other node) with n nodes
and m edges. I will choose some of the edges to make another strongly connected graph. Your task
is to guess that graph. Too difficult, right? Dont worry, you only need to guess k edges. If all the
edges exist in my graph, you win. I promise that from all possible graphs, the answer will be chosen
uniformly. The original graph will not have self-loops or duplicated edges.

You already have a guess, but you are a bit unsure. Why not write a program to calculate the
probability you win? For example, if n = 4, m = 5, the original graph has 5 edges: 1  2, 2  3, 3 
4, 4  1, 1  3, there are only two possible answers:

If k = 2, the best way is to guess edge 1  2 and 2  3 (or 1  2 and 3  4 etc.) which will
guarantee a win. But if you would like to risk by guessing edges 1  3 and 2  3, the probability you
win is 0.5.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 10 test cases. Each case begins with two integers n, m (3  n  15, 2  m  50).
Each of the following m lines contains two different integers u, v (1  u, v  n), that means u  v is
in the original graph. Edges are numbered 1 to m in the same order they appear in the input. The last
line begins with an integer k (1  k  m) and k different integers, the edges you guess.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the probability you win. Absolute error of 104 is allowed.
