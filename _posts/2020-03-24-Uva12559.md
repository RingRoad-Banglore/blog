title: Uva 12559  Finding Black Circles
---


```
There are some black circles completely drawn on a white paper. Given the digital image of the paper,
could you find the circles?

The width and height of the digital image are w and h pixels. Each pixel is a 1  1 square. The
center of the top-left pixel is (0, 0) and the center of the bottom-right pixel is (w  1, h 1). For each
circle, the center coordinates and the radius are all integers. If a circle passes through a pixel (merely
touching its border is not considered passing), the pixel is rendered black (1), otherwise it is white (0).
Due to noises, at most 2% black pixels might become white. No white pixels will become black.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  20). Each test case begins with two integers w
and h (30  w, h  100). The following h lines contain the digital image. There will be at least one
and at most five circles. The radius of each circle will be at least 5. The judge input will be carefully
chosen to avoid ambiguities and confusions.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the number of circles k, and k tuples (r,x,y), each describing a circle centered
at (x, y) with radius r. Tuples should be sorted lexicographically (first r, then x, and then y).

```
