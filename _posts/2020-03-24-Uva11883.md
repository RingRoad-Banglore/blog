title: Uva 11883  Repairing a Road
---


## Input

```text
You live in a small town with R bidirectional roads connecting C crossings and you want to go from
crossing 1 to crossing C as soon as possible. You can visit other crossings before arriving at crossing
C, but its not mandatory.

You have exactly one chance to ask your friend to repair exactly one existing road, from the time
you leave crossing 1. If he repairs the i-th road for t units of time, the crossing time after that would
be viati . Its not difficult to see that it takes vi units of time to cross that road if your friend doesnt
repair it. You cannot start to cross the road when your friend is repairing it.
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 25 test cases. Each test case begins with two integers C and R (2  C  100,
1  R  500). Each of the next R lines contains two integers xi, yi (1  xi, yi  C) and two positive
floating-point numbers vi and ai (1  vi  45, 1  ai  5), indicating that there is a bidirectional road
connecting crossing xi and yi, with parameters vi and ai (see above). Each pair of crossings can be
connected by at most one road. The input is terminated by a test case with C = R = 0, you should
not process it.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the smallest time it takes to reach crossing C from crossing 1, rounded to 3
digits after decimal point. Its always possible to reach crossing C from crossing 1.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3 2
1 2 1.5 1.8
2 3 2.0 1.5
2 1
1 2 2.0 1.8
0 0

```
