## Input

```text
Theorem

For any two integers x and k there exists two more integers p and q such that:

x = p
x
k


+ q

x
k


Its a fairly easy task to prove this theorem, so wed not ask you to do that. Wed ask for something

even easier! Given the values of x and k, youd only need to find integers p and q that satisfies the
given equation.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer, T (1  T  1000) that gives you the number of test
cases. In each of the following T lines youd be given two positive integers x and k. You can safely
assume that x and k will always be less than 108.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each of the test cases print two integers: p and q in one line. These two integers are to be separated
by a single space. If there are multiple pairs of p and q that satisfy the equation, any one would do.
But to help us keep our task simple, please make sure that the values,

p
x
k


and q

x
k


fit in a 64 bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Output

5 2
40 2
24444 6
