## Input

```
With increased popularity of programming competitions, there are so many online judges where con-
testants can practice. Usually, most of these sites allow users to submit solutions to problems and if
they are accepted, the users total number of solved is increased. To increase competition among users,
these sites maintain a ranking of users based on the total number of solves. Unfortunately, this at
times has introduced unhealthy competition among some users. A lot of the problems at these sites are
collected from external sites, and the online judge uses data file directly from these external sites. This
means, for certain problem, one is only required to submit the output file to get a problem accepted,
without solving the problem at all. Just out of curiosity, you try to investigate how many of these
problems are actually using judge data from the external site. To accelerate your investigation, you
want to automate the process of creating codes that will submit judge data only. In this problem, you
are required to make such a code generator.
```

## Output

```
Each case of input starts with a positive integer N < 100. N lines follow each containing at least 1
and at most 100 characters. The Input characters will consist of alphanumeric, spaces, backslash and
quotation only. The last case is followed by a value of 0 for N .

```

## Sample Input

```
Each case of output will start with a line containing the case number in the format Case x: where
x is the case number. The next few lines will be a C code which when compiled and run will generate
the input given for that case. Since there are so many ways to write a program that will generate the
same output, for this problem we will restrict ourselves to the following format.

#include<string.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
<case specific lines>
printf("\n");
return 0;
}

<case specific lines> will contain the same number of lines as N for that case, each formatted as:
printf("< line >\n"); where < line > is the input value entered for that corresponding line. Note
that, the two characters " and \ must be escaped by a \ in order to be displayed by printf . The
sample input/output will clarify further.

In case you are curious, why there is a printf("\n"); before the return 0;, its there to get this
code presentation error so that its not counted as accepted. You dont want to increase your number
that way, do you?
