## Input

```
So what effect does a marriage ceremony has on an arbitrary bachelor (boy)? Well it depends on his
thought process and context: he can be happy or sad. But in general what a marriage ceremony does is
that it decreases the number of both bachelor and spinster (Female Bachelor) by one in the community.
And so marriage ceremony has an effect on the probability of marriage of a bachelor.

Lets simplify things a bit as life is more compli-
cated than what we want to admit. Suppose in a com-
munity there are B bachelors and S spinsters (Both B
and S are strictly positive) and all of them are equally
likely to be married with one another (ahem! a bach-
elor and a spinster of course) and marriage does not
happen outside the community. And so in this model
the probability of getting married for any bachelor is
S
B

or 1 (The value that is smaller). So when a mar-
riage ceremony occurs the probability becomes (S1)

(B1)
or 1 (The value that is smaller). But of course if the
denominator becomes zero the probability cannot be
determined. Whether this new probability (S1)

(B1) is greater than the previous one (
S
B

) depends on the
relative values of B and S (B > S, B = S or B < S). Given the number of bachelors and spinsters in
a community your job is to find out whether or not the probability of marriage for any bachelor will
increase or decrease in the community after a marriage ceremony has occurred.

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 1000 lines of inputs. Each line contains two integers B and S (0 <
B,S < 2000000001).

Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line should contain the serial of output followed
by a :-), :-( or :-| respectively (without the quotes) depending on whether or not the probability
of marriage for a bachelor increases, decreases or remains same. If the desired probability after the
marriage cannot be determined then produce the output :-\ (Without the quotes) instead.
