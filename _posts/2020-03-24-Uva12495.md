## Input

```
In how many ways you can select K objects from N different circularly placed objects such that the
selection does not contain any pair of distinct objects having distance less than D around the circle?
Here distance is the minimum of clockwise and anticlockwise distance. Details in following figure:

Here, 5 objects {A, B, C, D, E} are placed circularly. Say, K = 2 and D = 2, then the 5 possible
selections are {A, C}, {A, D}, {B, D}, {B, E}, {C, E}. A selection is considered to be different from
the others if it contains at least 1 object which is not present in the other selection.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T  5000). Each of the following T lines contains
three positive integers N (1  N  1000), K (1  K  N) and D (1  D  10), respectively.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print a line of the form Case < x >: < y >, where x is the case number and y is the
number of ways modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

```

## Sample Output

```
4
5 2 2
5 2 1
3 2 2
