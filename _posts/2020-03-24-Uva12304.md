## Input

```text
This is a collection of 110 (in binary) 2D geometry problems.

CircumscribedCircle x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3
Find out the circumscribed circle of triangle (x1, y1)  (x2, y2)  (x3, y3). These three points are

guaranteed to be non-collinear. The circle is formatted as (x, y, r) where (x, y) is the center of circle, r
is the radius.

InscribedCircle x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3
Find out the inscribed circle of triangle (x1, y1)(x2, y2)(x3, y3). These three points are guaranteed

to be non-collinear. The circle is formatted as (x, y, r) where (x, y) is the center of circle, r is the radius.

TangentLineThroughPoint xc yc r xp yp
Find out the list of tangent lines of circle centered (xc, yc) with radius r that pass through point

(xp, yp). Each tangent line is formatted as a single real number angle (in degrees), the angle of the
line (0  angle < 180). Note that the answer should be formatted as a list (see below for details).

CircleThroughAPointAndTangentToALineWithRadius xp yp x1 y1 x2 y2 r
Find out the list of circles passing through point (xp, yp) that is tangent to a line (x1, y1) (x2, y2)

with radius r. Each circle is formatted as (x, y), since the radius is already given. Note that the answer
should be formatted as a list. If there is no answer, you should print an empty list.

CircleTangentToTwoLinesWithRadius x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4 r
Find out the list of circles tangent to two non-parallel lines (x1, y1) (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) (x4, y4),

having radius r. Each circle is formatted as (x, y), since the radius is already given. Note that the
answer should be formatted as a list. If there is no answer, you should print an empty list.

CircleTangentToTwoDisjointCirclesWithRadius x1 y1 r1 x2 y2 r2 r
Find out the list of circles externally tangent to two disjoint circles (x1, y1, r1) and (x2, y2, r2), having

radius r. By externally we mean it should not enclose the two given circles. Each circle is formatted
as (x, y), since the radius is already given. Note that the answer should be formatted as a list. If there
is no answer, you should print an empty list.

For each line described above, the two endpoints will not be equal. When formatting a list of real
numbers, the numbers should be sorted in increasing order; when formatting a list of (x, y) pairs, the
pairs should be sorted in increasing order of x. In case of tie, smaller y comes first.
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 1000 sub-problems, one in each line, formatted as above. The coordinates will
be integers with absolute value not greater than 1000. The input is terminated by end of file (EOF).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input line, print out your answer formatted as stated in the problem description. Each
number in the output should be rounded to six digits after the decimal point. Note that the list should
be enclosed by square brackets, and tuples should be enclosed by brackets. There should be no space
characters in each line of your output.

```
