---


## Input

```
After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, you obtained a job at Top Shelf Software, Inc., as
an entry-level computer engineer. On the first day, your manager sits down with you and tasks you with
the following job: We want to see how well you understand computer programming and the abstract
science behind it. As an evaluation for all of our new hires, we require them to write a program to
determine the relationship between pairs of sets. Im quite sure that youll do well; my confidence is
high. Heres a list of requirements for what the program should do. Good luck.
```

## Output

```
Your program should accept an even number of lines of text. Each pair of lines will represent two sets;
the first line represents set A, the second line represents set B. Each line of text (set) will be a list of
distinct integers.

```

## Sample Input

```
After each pair of lines has been read in, the sets should be compared and one of the following responses
should be output:

 A is a proper subset of B

 B is a proper subset of A

 A equals B

 A and B are disjoint

 I'm confused!

```

## Sample Output

```
