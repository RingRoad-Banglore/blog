## Input

```
Most of you are aware of Nuclear Power Plant Explosion at
Fukushima after devastating earth quake and tsunami. Many
people in Bangladesh were seen to be concerned with radiation.
The message says:

BBC Flash news: Japan Government confirms radi-
ation leak at Fukushima nuclear plants. Asian coun-
tries should take necessary precautions. If rain comes,
remain indoors first 24 hours. Close doors and win-
dows. Swab neck skin with betadine where thyroid
area is, radiation hits thyroid first. Take extra pre-
cautions. Radiation may hit Philippine at around 4
pm today. If it rains today or in the next few days
in Hong Kong, do not go under the rain. If you get
caught out, use an umbrella or raincoat, even if it is
only a drizzle. Radioactive particles, which may cause
burns, alopecia or even cancer, may be in the rain.

Many people suggested many things. We, the programmer society, were not inactive. We uploaded
a picture in a very popular social network website, facenote and said, There are two ways to be safe
from radiation. One is the Disky way and another is the Buseen way. You may get clear idea of those
two ways from the picture.

Anyway, after the explosion of Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant a bottle of water was sent to my
laboratory for experiment. But my stupid robot assistant kept it with N identical water bottles of
which I cant distinguish the special water bottle which came from Japan. I know that if a rat drinks
the water from the special bottle, it will die in the 5-th minute. Now, I want to identify the special
bottle. But I do not like rat either. So, I want to buy minimum number of rats. Can you help me to
find out the minimum number of rats I need for identifying the special bottle in 5 minutes?

I forgot to tell you that, only one drop of water from a bottle is enough to find out if the water is
safe or not. And you may also give waters from several bottles to a single rat. If one of these bottles is
the special bottle then the rat will die, otherwise it will not. And assume that the time to give waters
to the rats is negligible, because once you decide the strategy; you may ask the robot assistant to do
it. And the robot can do it in no time. And you can also assume that the bottles contain sufficient
amount of waters.

Input starts with an integer T ( 3000), denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case starts with a line containing an integer N (0  N  1016).

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and the minimum number of rats required for identifying the
special bottle.

Note: For case 2, the robot assistant kept the special bottle with 2 identical bottles. So, there are 3
bottles, one of them is the special bottle. The minimum number of rats is 2. Because just give a drop

from bottle 1 to the 1-st rat and a drop from bottle 2 to the 2-nd rat. If the 1-st rat dies, so its clear
that bottle 1 is the special one. If the 2-nd rat dies, then the second bottle is the special one. And if
none of them dies, then the 3-rd bottle is the special bottle. So, 2 rats are enough. But there are other
options, too. Like give the first rat two drops from bottle 1 and 2. And give the second rat a drop from
bottle 2. Then the special bottle can also be determined. So, there can be many options, but you need
at least 2 rats.
