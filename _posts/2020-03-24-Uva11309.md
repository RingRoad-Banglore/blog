```
Wolfgang Pucks rival, Emeril Lagasse (BAM!), recently set the world
culinary record in the category of smallest souffl measuring in at a mere
2 cm! Wolfgang, not to be outdone, decided that he would set a culinary
record of his own: the most symmetric marble cake in the world. This
is clearly not an easy feat!

As we all know from Wolfgangs bestselling biography, he is a very
superstitious chef. In his attempts to create the symmetric cake, he has
vowed to remove the cake from the oven only at a palindromic time, i.e.,
a time that reads the same when read from left-to-right as right-to-left.
Not including the current time, when is the next opportunity for Wolfgang to remove his cake?
```

## Input

```
On the first line of the input you are given n, the number of attempts Wolfgang makes to make his
symmetric cake. The following n lines contain a string formatted as HH:MM  indicating the current
time on a twenty-four hour clock. (So 0  HH  23 and 0  MM  59 and 00:00 follows 23:59)

```

## Output

```
For each attempt, output a string indicating the next palindromic time (not including the current time)
on a single line formatted as HH:MM . When determining if HH : MM is palindromic, ignore all
leading zeroes in HH. If HH is zero then ignore all leading zeroes in MM .

```

## Sample Input

```
3
00:00
23:30
14:59

```

## Sample Output

```
00:01
23:32
15:51
```
