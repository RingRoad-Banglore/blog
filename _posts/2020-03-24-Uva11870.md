## Input

```
Little Rushel is preparing for his English test. Part of the test includes matching pairs of words as
antonyms or synonyms. A pair of words are called synonyms of each other if both words mean the
same thing. For example, big and large are synonyms. A pair of words are called antonyms of each
other if each is the opposite of the other. For example, big and small are antonyms.

For his test, Rushel needs to memorize a huge list of words. This is really tedious and he would
rather spend the time learning to program. So, he comes up with a clever scheme. He notices that if one
word is a synonym of another, it is also the antonym of all words that are antonyms of that word. This
means that he needs only remember that the words big and large are synonyms and that big and
small are antonyms, and from that he can infer that large and small are also antonyms. Thus he
does not need to memorize the relationship between all pairs of words, only enough for him to be able
to deduce the answer for the rest. Of course, not all words are related (e.g. big and cold), but the
examiner is a sensible person and will not ask meaningless questions like that.

After a little more thought, Rushel observed that for a set of words that are related, the following
rules apply:

1. If A and B are synonyms and B and C are synonyms, A and C are synonyms.

2. If A and B are synonyms and B and C are antonyms, A and C are antonyms.

3. If A and B are antonyms and B and C are synonyms, A and C are antonyms.

4. If A and B are antonyms and B and C are antonyms, A and C are synonyms.

Unfortunately for Rushel, his friends pointed out that the rules are too simple for a real human
language like English. For example, if fed the data that ice and water are antonyms, and that fire
and water are also antonyms, it would lead one to infer that ice and fire are synonyms (by Rule
4), which is obviously wrong. Rushel thinks that this is not really a good example (after all, it doesnt
make a lot of sense), but he is still concerned that there might be equally nonsensical relationships in
the words that he is learning. He has already prepared lists of synonyms and antonyms to learn, he
thinks it will be enough to just check if any of them contain any contradictions.

A set of relationships is said to contain a contradiction if some of the relationships imply or state
that a certain pair of words are synonyms while some of the other relationships imply or state that the
same pair are antonyms.

Please help Rushel, who is too young to be allowed into this contest, by writing a program that
takes as its input sets of pairs of synonyms and antonyms and verifies that there are no contradictions
in them.

## Output

```
The first line of the input will containa single integer T all by itself, T  100. T test cases follow.
Each test case starts with two numbers N and M (1  N,M  1000). N lines follow, each containing

a pair of words separated by one or more spaces. Then another M lines follow, also containing pairs of
words separated by one or more spaces. Words will be made up of lowercase English characters only
(a to z), and will never be more than 20 characters long. The first set (the first N pairs) is the set
of synonyms and the second set (the latter M pairs) is the set of antonyms.
