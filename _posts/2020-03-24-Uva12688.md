title: Uva 12688  Spanning Trees in a Secure Lock Pattern
---


## Input

```

Screen lock on a smart phone can be secured with pattern. Unlock pattern may have 9 nodes on
the 3  3 grid. In this problem, we modify this arrangement slightly such that the grid size can be
varied from 2  2 to m  m, and only a limited number of connections between adjacent nodes are
permitted. Let call this a modified mesh graph G and V is a set of vertices (nodes) and E is a set of
edges (connections). Examples of 2 2, 3 3 and 4 4 modified mesh graphs are given in the figures
below. Note that the corner vertices have 3 connections at most, while the middle vertices can have up
to 8 connections. Only a connection to adjacent vertices is allowed, a constraint of the problem.

We define a spanningtree in our problem as a collection of lines in the graph forming no closed
loops, containing a path between any two points of the graph covering m2 = n vertices and n1 edges.
Spanning trees in a graph can have many shapes or patterns.

To calculate a number of spanning trees in G, let G be a graph with vertices labeled v1, , . . . , vn.
We form an nn matrix tree T = [tij ] as follows.

 If i = j, then tii is the number of lines to vi in the graph.

 If i = j, then tij = 0 if there is no line between vi and vj in G.

 If i = j, then tij = 1 if there is a line between vi and vj in G.

Then, the number of spanning trees in G is given by

cofactor of aij = (1)i+jMij

where Mij is the determinant of the (n 1) (n 1) matrix obtained by deleting row i and column j
of the matrix tree T . Evaluate any cofactor of T yields the same result.

Example 1: A matrix tree T of 2 2 modified mesh graph is

T =




3 1 1 1
1 3 1 1
1 1 3 1
1 1 1 3


 .

Evaluate any cofactor of T . For example, covering up row 1 and column 1, we have

(1)1+1M11 =


3 1 1
1 3 1
1 1 3

 = 16.

Therefore, a number of spanning tree is 16.

Example 2: A matrix tree T of 3 3 modified mesh graph is

T =




3 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 5 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 3 0 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 5 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 0 3 1 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 5 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 3



.

Evaluate any cofactor of T will yield the same value which is the number of spanning trees.

Hint: Determinant calculation using elementary row operation method:

To calculate a determinant you need to transform an original matrix into an upper triangular matrix
(all elements below main diagonal are zero). Reduce the matrix to row echelon form using elementary
row operations so that all the elements below diagonal are zero. Then multiply the main diagonal
elements of a matrix to get the determinant value.

Your task is to write a program to find the number of spanning trees for a given size m m of a
modified mesh graph.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer N (1  N  5) denoting the number of test cases. After
that N test cases follow. Each test case contains a single integer m (2  m  6) denoting a size of an
mm modified mesh graph.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, your program should output the number of spanning trees, which indicates how
many patterns of spanning trees there are for a given modified mesh graph. Print out one line per test
case, respectively.

Explanation

In the sample input below, there is only 1 test case (N = 1). For example, in the first test case
there are 16 different spanning trees for m = 2. These spanning trees are listed below. Note that your
program is NOT required to draw all possible patterns.
