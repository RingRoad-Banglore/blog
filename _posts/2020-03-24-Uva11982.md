```
ICC World Cup 2011 has just finished. During the world cup, lots of cricket fans were playing an online
game named Fantasy Cricket.

The score board of fantasy cricket looks like the following image. After each match of the world cup
the score board of fantasy cricket updates.

Figure 1

Each player plays a role of a manager here. In the rank list there is a symbol besides each manger.
There are three kinds of symbols. These are explained in the following table.

Symbol Explanation ASCII
Representation

The rank of the player has upgraded after last match,
i.e. if the current rank of the player is K, the rank of
the player before the last match was greater than K.

U

The rank of the player has downgraded after the last
match, i.e. if the current rank of the player is K, the
rank of the player before the last match was less than
K.

D

The rank of the player has not changed after the last
match, i.e. if the current rank of the player is K, the
rank of the player before the last match was also K.

E

You will be given such a score board after a particular match. Can you determine any possible valid
ordering of the players exactly before that round? For this problem you have to print the number of
possible ordering before the last match.

Here is an example:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 11982  Fantasy Cricket 2/2

Rank Manager
1 A
2 B
3 C
4 D

Figure 2

Possible Possible
Previous Order 1 Previous Order 2

B B
A D
D A
C C

Figure 3

For this rank (figure 2), only two different ordering are possible (figure 3) before the last match
which comply the current ordering with the symbols.

Name of the managers are not important for this problem. So, for a scoreboard, you will be given
a sequence of ASCII representation of the symbols (stated above), i.e. you will be given a string which
only contains U, D and E.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 300), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing a string. The length of the string will be between 1 and
1000. The string will contain characters from {U, D, E}.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the case number and the number of possible orderings modulo 1000000007.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
UDUD
EEE
DU

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 2
Case 2: 1
Case 3: 0
```
