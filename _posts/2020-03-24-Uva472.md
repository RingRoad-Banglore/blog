title: Uva 00472  Simultaneous Equations
---


## Input

```text
Write a program that will solve a n by n system of simultaneous equations where the coefficients of the
equations are complex numbers. (Recall that a complex number is an imaginary number of the form
a+ b 


1, where a and b are real numbers.)
```

## Output

```text
Input contains several datasets, each separated by an empty line. Each dataset consists of 0 < n  99
lines each containing n+ 1 complex numbers in the form (a, b). The j-th, 1  j  n, complex number
at line i is the coefficient of the j-th unknown in the i-th equation and the last complex number at line
i represents the right-hand side of the i-th equation.

```

## Sample Input

```text
for each dataset, the output consists of n lines containing pairs of the form (a, b). The pair on line
i of output represents the i-th root of the input system of equations. Each pair is to be printed
in parenthesis with numbers accurately rounded to one digit to the right of the decimal
point, as the sample below.

In case the input system of equations can not be uniquely solved, your program should produce the
sentence No solution as output.

Print a blank line between datasets.

```

## Sample Output

```text
(1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (14,0)
(2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (20,0)
(3,0) (4,0) (5,0) (26,0)

(1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0)
(2,0) (4,0) (6,0) (8,0)
(3,0) (4,0) (5,0) (26,0)
