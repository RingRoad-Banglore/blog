## Input

```
Well, that seems to be the situation. But,
I dont want that, and you dont want that,

and Ringo here definitely doesnt want that.
Jules Winnfield

I have n tiny rings made of steel. I also have m pieces of rope, all of exactly the same length. The
two ends of each piece of rope are tied to two different rings.

I am going to take one of the rings, L, into my left hand, and another ring, R into my right
hand. Then I will pull the whole structure apart as hard as I can. Some of the ropes will be streched
horizontally because of this. Others will hang down or bend out of shape. If I want the number of
horizontally stretched ropes to be as large as possible, which L and R should I pick?

Assume that the stretching of ropes in negligible, they all have negligible thickness and are free to
slide around the rings that they are tied to. The thickness and radius of each ring is negligible, too.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with two lines
containing n (2  n  120) and m (0  m  n(n  1)/2). The next m lines will each contain a pair
of different rings (integers in the range [0, n 1]). Each pair of rings will be connected by at most one
rope.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the line containing Case #x:, followed by the largest number of ropes that
I can stretch horizontally by picking a pair of rings, L and R.
