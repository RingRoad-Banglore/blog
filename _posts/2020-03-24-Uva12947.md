title: Uva 12947  Texting with Grandma
---


## Input

```text
Grandma has bought a state-of-the-art shinny new mobile phone. She is specially excited because she
will text with Eloi even if he is away from home. Grandma is sugar and spice, and everything nice,
specially when she is texting ... she is a living message sent from a time we did not live. Eloi, always
set in the old ways, is worried he will not be able to text with Grandma because his mobile phone is so
old that he is hardly able to play snakes on it. As a matter of fact, his mobile has been discontinued
for a couple of years already.

The new hype in the texting scene is to text trees because research in computer science have found
a way to pack any tree. By tree we mean a labeled undirected graph in which there is exactly one
path between any pair of vertices. Grandma cannot wait to send Eloi messages packed with tons of
electronic trees of many sorts drawn with all her love.

For a tree T with set of n vertices V = {0, . . . , n  1}, where n  2, the tree packing algorithm
implemented in Grandmas mobile on input T builds a sequence t of exactly n 2 vertices as follows:

let t the empty sequence
for each k = 1, ..., n-2
let L be the set of leaves of T
let m be the minimum element of L
append to t the unique vertex adjacent to m
remove m from T

As an example, consider the following oak drawn by Grandma, with set of vertices {0, 1, . . . , 8}:

0 3

4

5

1

82

6

7

One can check that the oak drawn by Grandma is packed into the sequence 5, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 5 by the
tree packing algorithm.

Eloi will be getting texts from Grandma soon and he is faced with the following problem: given a
sequence t of integer numbers, he would like to have an app for his old mobile for detecting if t can be
the output of the tree packing algorithm for some input tree T with set of vertices V = {0, . . . ,m 1}
for some positive integer m. If this is the case, he would like to unpack t into its associated tree T ,
so that he can appreciate Grandmas texting love. Since Elois mobile is old (as in very old), this app
needs to be very efficient.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of a single line describing a non-empty
sequence t of blank-separated integers between 0 and 100000, both limits inclusive. You can assume
that 1  |t|  100000.

## Sample Input

```text
For sequence t described in each test case:

 if t can not be the output of the tree packing algorithm, then output impossible;

 if t is the output of the tree packing algorithm for some input tree T with set of vertices V , output
|V | + 1 lines: the first line contains |V | and the next 1  i  |V | lines each lists in ascending
order the set of vertices directly associated to vertex i  1 in T (output a single blank between
consecutive numbers).

Print a line with a single asterisk (*) between consecutive test cases.

```

## Sample Output

```text
5 8 0 3 3 0 5
1 7 1 2

```
