title: Uva 10620  A flea on a chessboard
---


## Input

```text
An infinite chessboard is obtained by extending a fi-
nite chessboard to the right and up infinitely. Each
square of the chessboard is either black or white with
the side of S milimiters, 0 < S < 1000. The left-
most bottom square of the chessboard is black. A flea
is possitioned on the chessboard at the point (x, y)
(given in milimeters) and makes jumps by jumping
dx milimeters to the right and dy milimiters up,
0 < dx, dy, that is, a flea at position (x, y) after one
jump lands at position (x+ dx, y + dy).

Given the starting position of the flea on the
board your task is to find out after how many jumps
the flea will reach a white square. If the flea lands
on a boundary between two squares then it does not
count as landing on the white square. Note that it is possible that the flea never reaches a white square.
```

## Output

```text
Each test case consists of one line of input containing five non-negative numbers separated by white
space and giving S, x, y, dx, and dy. An input line containing five zeroes follows the last test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For test case print one line of output in the format shown in the sample.
