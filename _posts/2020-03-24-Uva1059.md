## Input

```text
The eccentric sculptor Albrecht Caravaggio Mondrian has been inspired by the history of the computer
to create works of art that he calls Jacquard circuits. Each of his works of art consists of a series
of polygonal circuit boards (defined below), all having the same shape but at different scales, joined
together with wire or string into a three-dimensional tiered structure. Figure 1 below shows an example
with two levels and a pentagonal shape.

Figure 1

A.C.M. (as he is known to his friends) bases
his art upon the punched hole cards of the
Jacquard loom (that were later adapted by
Charles Babbage for his analytical engine) and
upon the regular grid layout approach often
used in circuit interfacing (for instance, Pin
Grid Arrays).

The circuit boards used in the sculptures
are in the shapes of lattice polygons. A lat-
tice polygon is defined as any closed, non-self-
intersecting cycle of straight line segments that
join points with integer coordinates, with no
two consecutive line segments parallel. For any
given lattice polygon P , there is a smallest lat-
tice polygon with the same shape and orienta-
tion as P  call this the origin. Smaller poly-
gons of the same shape and orientation as P are called its predecessors and polygons larger than P are
its successors. (See Figure 2.)

Figure 2

To build one of his sculptures, A.C.M. begins by randomly selecting N lattice points and then
drawing a pattern by connecting these points. (Note that not all of the N points are necessarily
vertices of a lattice polygon. This may happen, for example, if three or more consecutive points are

collinear.) Let P be the lattice polygon determined by the pattern. Then he determines the origin
corresponding to P , selects the number of levels, M , he wishes to use, and constructs the first M
polygonal circuit boards in the series (that is, the origin and its first M  1 successors). Each lattice
point lying strictly within the boundary of any of these polygons is a hole where strings or wires meet.

The hard part of creating the sculpture is tying together all the strings or wires that meet at a given
hole. Furthermore, some of A.C.M.s famous miniaturized sculptures, built using nano-engineering
techniques, involve hundreds of thousands of levels. Mondrian would like a way to determine, given a
polygonal shape and the number of levels, how many holes there will be in the final sculpture. You
must write a program to help him. (For example, the sculpture in Figure 1 above has 15 holes.) Assume
holes have zero diameter.

## Output

```text
The input consists of one or more test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two positive
integers N (3  N  1000) and M (1  M  1000000). N is the number of lattice points Mondrian
selected and M is the number of levels in the completed sculpture. Each of the next N lines contains
two integers x, y (|x|, |y|  1000000) which denote the coordinates of one of Mondrians points. Points
are listed in either clockwise or counterclockwise order.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeroes.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a line containing the test case number (beginning with 1) followed by the
number of holes in an M -level sculpture starting from the origin polygon of the given pattern. In no
case will this value exceed the maximum possible value of a 64-bit signed integer.
