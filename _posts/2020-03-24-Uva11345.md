number of rectangles M (1  M  30). Next N lines contain 4 integers: X1 Y1 X2 Y2 (10000 
X1;Y2;X2;Y2  10000). Each rectangle is described by 2 points: lower left and upper right corners.
All rectangle sides are parallel to Ox or Oy axes.

```

```
For each test case out line formatter like this: Case i: a. Where i is a test number, and a is an area
that belongs to all rectangles.
