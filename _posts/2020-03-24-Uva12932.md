title: Uva 12932  Defeat the Wrong Program
---


```
Find a cell in an nm grid such that the sum of integers in the cross shape (a cell and all the cells in
the same row or column) is maximized. If the answer is not unique, you can print any solution.

In the example on the right:

The best solution is (1,3), i.e. the intersection of the first row
from above, and the 3rd column from left. The sum of integers
in the cross-shape is 5*7 = 35.

The problem above is from a local programming contest. After
the contest data has been generated, one of the judges has come
up with the following algorithm:

First, find a row r (1  r  n) with the maximum sum, then find a column c (1  c  m) with
the maximum sum, and finally output (r, c). If there is a tie, print the smallest r and/or c.

Obviously, this algorithm does NOT guarantee a correct answer, but to their surprise, this program
passed most judge data! Could you identify the weak data so that the judges can improve these data?
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each case begins with two integers n, m (1  n  500, 1  m 
500), the number of rows and columns. Then n lines follow, each containing m integers between 1 and
100. The whole input size does not exceed 2MB.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and Weak or Strong.

```

## Sample Input

```
4 4
5 5 5 5
1 1 5 1
1 1 5 1
1 1 5 1
5 4
2 5 1 1
1 1 9 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: Weak
Case 2: Strong
```
