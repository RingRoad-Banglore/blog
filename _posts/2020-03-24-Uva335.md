title: Uva 00335  Processing MX Records
---


## Input

```
Mapping symbolic machine names, like bigone.stateu.edu, to the corresponding Internet network address
(like 24.99.100.33) is a major function of the Domain Naming System, or DNS. The pieces of a machines
symbolic name, separated by periods, correspond to nodes in a tree when the name is read right to
left. The pieces corresponding to internal nodes in the tree correspond to domains. The edu domain,
for example, is the node under which we find all college and university machines in the United States.
All machines in Canada are found under the ca domain.

By providing one or more MX records (lines of text in a particular file), a system manager can
arrange for DNS to route mail bound for one machine to another instead. Rerouting is appropriate in
many cases, but one frequent use is to create addresses for fictitious machines with meaningful names.
For example, it might be nice to allow mail to be addressed to info.stateu.edu, but not have a specific
machine named info on the stateu campus. The mail could be redirected to bigone.stateu.edu by using
an appropriate MX record. In this problem well deal with processing a simplified form of MX records.

An MX record has three fields, or sequences of non-blank characters. These fields are separated by
one or more blanks. The first field, if present, always begins in the first column on a line. If the first
field is not present, then it is assumed to be the same as the first field from the preceding line (or the
one assumed for that line if it didnt have one). The first and third fields are symbolic machine names,
and will contain no more than 36 characters. The second field is a non-negative integer specifying a
preference. Lets look at an example.

info.stateu.edu 0 bigone.stateu.edu
10 tiny.stateu.edu

The first line says that all mail destined for info.stateu.edu should be delivered to
bigone.stateu.edu. The preference in this MX record is 0, versus 10 for the second MX record. If
bigone.stateu.edu is down, then mail for info would instead be redirected to tiny. Smaller numbers
indicate higher preference, and MX records need not be given in order of increasing preference.

Wildcard MX records allow redirection of mail to many machines with a single MX record. For
example,

*.citycc.midville.edu 0 tiny.stateu.edu

would redirect mail to any machine whose name has the symbolic suffix .citycc.midville.edu to the
machine tiny on the stateu campus. For simplicity, we will assume that the asterisk (*) representing
a wildcard record will appear only in the first part of a wildcarded symbolic name, and that no more
than three periods will occur in any symbolic name.

What you will do in this problem is record MX records, process commands that indicate when
machines go up or down, and process requests to determine how to redirect mail based on the recorded
MX records.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a line containing an integer N , following by N lines, each of which contain an MX
record that is to be read and recorded. (There is no explicit limit on the value of N .) The remaining
lines of input (after the N MX records) will each begin with the letter U, D, A, or X in column 1.
Following a U or D will be one or more blanks and a machine name. D means the machine is now

down (not operational), while U means it is now up. All machines are initially assumed to be up at
the beginning of the input. An A in column 1 will be followed by one or more spaces and a symbolic
machine name. That machine name is to be processed (at the time the line is read) using the recorded
MX records and the up/down status of machines to determine how mail to that machine should be
directed. Of course some machines may not have their mail redirected, so be prepared to handle these
cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output for these A lines is as shown in the samples. Note the output style for machines which have
no redirection indicated (that is, there are no applicable MX records). The end of input is indicated
by a line containing X in column 1.

Notes:

1. No input line will contain more than 80 characters.

2. MX records are not to be processed recursively. Thus if mail to first.com is being redirected
to second.com by one MX record, any additional MX records that might redirect mail from
second.com to another machine are not examined during the processing of first.com.
