title: Uva 10567  Helping Fill Bates
---


## Input

```text
Everyone knows Fill Bates but I guess fewer people know that he was famous in his high school days
for a different reason. I just put below the exact lines from one of his short biographies:

Before high-school graduation, Bates was renowned for designing the class scheduling soft-
ware that placed him in a class full of girls. With his present success, those girls are probably
mutilating themselves for not buying in on an early investment.

Now you are to help him with a completely different purpose. His company has initiated a talent
search program in QSA. It has 52 states (the original 50 states plus the two recent troublesome additions
Oraq and Malistan). The candidates from the 52 states are given a state identity and a serial number
(The serial number is unique). The state identities for the 52 states are the 52 ASCII characters A..Z
and a..z. The talent search process is a bit strange. At most 1 million candidates stand in a single
line according to the increasing order their serial number (Starting with 0 and then 1, 2, 3 etc) with
a placard showing only their state identity (After all who wants to hire employees from Oraq and
Malistan). Mr. Fill Gates then writes a sequence of characters (Only alphabets). If candidates are
found in that order of states with increasing serial numbers (Some candidates may be skipped for this
purpose) then those candidates are taken. Other wise an appropriate message is given.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains only one set of input. First line of the input file contains a string S containing
only alphabets. The length of this string is at most 1000000. The next line contains an integer Q
(0 < Q < 3501) which indicates the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contain one string SS
of length less than 101. These strings are the strings written by Fill Bates.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query you should output one line. If candidates are not found in the order written by Fill
Bates then you should output a string Not matched (Without the quotes), otherwise you should print
Matched (Note that an space is printed after Matched) and then the serial of the first candidate in
the subsequence and the serial of the last candidate of the subsequence. These two integers should be
separated by a single space. If there is more than one such subsequence then choose the one which has
smallest starting serial number. If there is a tie choose the one with the smallest ending serial number.

```

## Sample Output
