title: Uva 12468  Zapping
---


## Input

```
Im a big fan of watching TV. However, I dont like to watch a single channel; Im constantly zapping
between different channels.

My dog tried to eat my remote controller and unfortunately he partially destroyed it. The numeric
buttons I used to press to quickly change channels are not working anymore. Now, I only have available
two buttons to change channels: one to go up to the next channel (the  button) and one to go down
to the previous channel (the  button). This is very annoying because if Im watching channel 3 and
want to change to channel 9 I have to press the  button 6 times!

My TV has 100 channels conveniently numbered 0 through 99. They are cyclic, in the sense that
if Im on channel 99 and press  Ill go to channel 0. Similarly, if Im on channel 0 and press  Ill
change to channel 99.

I would like a program that, given the channel Im currently watching and the channel I would like
to change to, tells me the minimum number of button presses I need to reach that channel.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases (at most 200).

Each test case is described by two integers a and b in a single line. a is the channel Im currently
watching and b is the channel I would like to go to (0  a, b  99).

The last line of the input contains two -1s and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single integer on a single line  the minimum number of button presses
needed to reach the new channel (Remember, the only two buttons I have available are  and ).

```

## Sample Output

```
3 9
0 99
12 27
-1 -1

```
