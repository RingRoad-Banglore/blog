title: Uva 11135  Gopher that walks and swims
---


## Input

```text
A gopher lives in the flatlands of Northern Saskatchewan
and frequently visits his cousins living in the South-East
part of the same province. When going on a visit the gopher
has to cross a lot of ditches.

Saskatchewan has been suffering years of severe
drought. Recently, however, they experienced a period
of unusually heavy rains which resulted in flooding all the
ditches on the gophers route.

The ditches run along straight lines in the West-East or
South-North direction and each ditch is of a constant width.
The gopher still wants to make his travels but being not a
very good swimmer, he wants to minimize the distance that
he has to swim across the ditches. With this requirement
satisfied, he also wants to walk as little as possible on the
dry land. Your task is to find the length of the gophers
route which minimizes his swimming and then his walking.

We are given a system of orthogonal coordinates, where
the x axis is directed from West to East and the y axis is
directed from South to North. Given are positive real numbers: D and L, L+L < D, such that a point
(x, y) is on dry land if and only if there exist integers m and n such that

m D + L  x  (m+ 1) D  L and n D + L  y  (n+ 1) D  L

Given is the starting point of the gopher (xs, ys) and its target point (xt, yt). Both these points are
on dry land and also

0 < xs  xt,
ys  yt > 0,

xt  xs  ys  yt.

It is also known that the gopher on his way to the target point will not have to swim through more
than 300 ditches.

## Output

```text
Each line of input contains six numbers: D, L, xs, ys, xt, yt.

The last line of input has the value of D equal to zero and this line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

output.
