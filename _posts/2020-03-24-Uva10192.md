title: Uva 10192  Vacation
---


```
You are planning to take some rest and to go out on vacation, but you really dont know which cities
you should visit. So, you ask your parents for help. Your mother says My son, you MUST visit Paris,
Madrid, Lisboa and London. But its only fun in this order. Then your father says: Son, if youre
planning to travel, go first to Paris, then to Lisboa, then to London and then, at last, go to Madrid. I
know what Im talking about.

Now youre a bit confused, as you didnt expected this situation. Youre afraid that youll hurt your
mother if you follow your fathers suggestion. But youre also afraid to hurt your father if you follow
you mothers suggestion. But it can get worse, because you can hurt both of them if you simply ignore
their suggestions!

Thus, you decide that youll try to follow their suggestions in the better way that you can. So, you
realize that the Paris-Lisboa-London order is the one which better satisfies both your mother and
your father. Afterwards you can say that you could not visit Madrid, even though you wouldve liked
it very much.

If your father have suggested the London-Paris-Lisboa-Madrid order, then you would have two
orders, Paris-Lisboa and Paris-Madrid, that would better satisfy both of your parents suggestions.
In this case, you could only visit 2 cities.

You want to avoid problems like this one in the future. And what if their travel suggestions were
bigger? Probably you would not find the better way very easy. So, you decided to write a program to
help you in this task. Youll represent each city by one character, using uppercase letters, lowercase
letters, digits and the space. Thus, you can have at most 63 different cities to visit. But its possible
that youll visit some city more than once.

If you represent Paris with a, Madrid with b, Lisboa with c and London with d, then your
mothers suggestion would be abcd and you fathers suggestion would be acdb (or dacb, in the
second example).

The program will read two travel sequences and it must answer how many cities you can travel to
such that youll satisfy both of your parents and its maximum.
```

## Input

```
The input will consist on an arbitrary number of city sequence pairs. The end of input occurs when the
first sequence starts with an # character (without the quotes). Your program should not process this
case. Each travel sequence will be on a line alone and will be formed by legal characters (as defined
above). All travel sequences will appear in a single line and will have at most 100 cities.

```

## Output

```
For each sequence pair, you must print the following message in a line alone:

Case #d: you can visit at most K cities.

Where d stands for the test case number (starting from 1) and K is the maximum number of cities
you can visit such that youll satisfy both you fathers suggestion and you mothers suggestion.
