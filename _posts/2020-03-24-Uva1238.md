title: Uva 01238  Free Parentheses
---


```

You are given a simple arithmetic expression which consists of only addition and subtraction operators.
For example:

1 - 2 + 3 - 4 - 5

You are free to put any parentheses to the expression anywhere you want and as many as you want.
However it should be a valid expression after you put the parentheses. The question is how many
different numbers can you make?

For example, adding parentheses to the above expression can give you 6 different values:

1 - 2 + 3 - 4 - 5 = -7

1 - (2 + 3 - 4 - 5) = 5

1 - (2 + 3) - 4 - 5 = -13

1 - 2 + 3 - (4 - 5) = 3

1 - (2 + 3 - 4) - 5} = -5

1 - (2 + 3) - (4 - 5) = -3
```

## Input

```
There will be many expressions in the input. Each expression is written in one line. The expression con-
sists of only N (2  N  30) non-negative number less than 100, separated by addition or subtraction
operators. There will be no operator before the first number.

```

## Output

```
For each expression, print the number of different values that can be derived from the expression by
adding any number of parentheses.

```

## Sample Input

```
1 - 2 + 3 - 4 - 5

38 + 29 - 91

54 - 18 + 22 + 74

```

## Sample Output
