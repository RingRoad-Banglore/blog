title: Uva 11879  Multiple of 17
---


```
Theorem: If you drop the last digit d of an integer n (n  10), subtract 5d from the
remaining integer, then the difference is a multiple of 17 if and only if n is a multiple of 17.

For example, 34 is a multiple of 17, because 3-20=-17 is a multiple of 17; 201 is not a multiple of
17, because 20-5=15 is not a multiple of 17.

Given a positive integer n, your task is to determine whether it is a multiple of 17.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 10 test cases, each containing a single line with an integer n (1  n  10100).
The input terminates with n = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print 1 if the corresponding integer is a multiple of 17, print 0 otherwise.
