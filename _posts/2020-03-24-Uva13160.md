title: Uva 13160  Bribing Eve
---


## Input

```text
Eve works at a magazine that does product reviews and publishes
recommendations to consumers. They are working on a new mo-
bile phones review and have decided on two reproducible tests
that score each devices battery lifetime and performance using
an integer between 1 and 1000.

These two scores, x1 and x2, are then combined with a weights
vector w = [w1, w2] to produce an overall score:

s = w1x1 + w2x2 .

The final review ranking is then obtained by sorting the products
by decreasing order of s. Additionally, when multiple products
get exactly the same score, Eve decides how to order them.

Maria (a fake name to mask her identity) tried to bribe Eve to
tweak the results to get her product higher on the list. Eve argued
that she was not able to tamper the evaluation of each test, but
Maria suggested to tweak the weights w used when computing
the overall score. The weights w must be non-negative and at least one of them must be positive, but
the values are decided by Eve.

Eve is thinking whether to modify the weights in Marias benefit or not, and asked you to determine
what are the best and worst possible ranking positions for Marias product.

Given a list of all products scores in battery and performance [x1, x2] tests, find out what are the
best and worst positions in the ranking that can be given to Marias product when the weights [w1, w2]
and the order for tied products are left for Eve to decide.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line has the number N of products being compared. N lines follow, each containing two
integers x1 and x2 indicating a products score in the battery and performance tests. Marias product
is the first on the list.

Constraints
1  N  100 000 Number of products
1  x1, x2  1 000 Performance of a product in the tests

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output consists of two numbers A and B, on a line by itself, indicating the best
and worst possible positions that Marias product can get on the ranking given Eves ability to modify
the weights and ordering in case of a tie.
