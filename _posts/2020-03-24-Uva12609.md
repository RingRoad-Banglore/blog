---


```
Given an infinite sequence A with A[N ] (N  1) be-
ing the smallest multiple of 4 that begins with N ,
concatenate digits of A[N ] to create an infinite string
S. Chuck Norris can do this for you in his spare time.

What is the K-th digit in S?
Specifically, sequence begins as 12, 20, 32, 4, 52,

60, ..., resulting in

S = 12203245260....
```

## Input

```
Number of cases, each case contains positive integer
K (K  1015). Last case is followed by the line con-
taining a single zero.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the K-th digit of S on separate line.

```

## Sample Input

```
1
7
15
0

```

## Sample Output

```
1
4
9
```
