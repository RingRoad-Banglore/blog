## Input

```text
Given an alphabet S, and a probability Prob(a) for each a  S, a binary prefix code represents each a
in S as a bit string B(a), such that B(a1) is not a prefix of B(a2) for any a1 = a2 in S.

Huffmans algorithm constructs a binary prefix code by pairing the two least probable elements of
S, a0 and a1. a0 and a1 are given codes with a common (as yet to be determined) prefix p and differ
only in their last bit: B(a0) = p0 while B(a1) = p1. a0 and a1 are removed from S and replaced by a
new element b with Prob(b) = Prob(a0) + Prob(a1). b is an imaginary element standing for both a0
and a1. The Huffman code is computed for this reduced S, and p is set equal to B(b). This reduction
of the problem continues until S contains one element a represented by the empty string; that is, when
S = {a}, B(a) = .

Huffmans code is optimal in that there is no other prefix code with a shorter average length defined
as: 

aS
Prob(a) |B(a)|

One problem with Huffman codes is that they dont necessarily preserve any ordering that the
elements may have. For example, suppose S = {A,B,C} and Prob(A) = 0.7, Prob(B) = 0.1,
Prob(C) = 0.2. A Huffman code for S is B(A) = 1, B(B) = 00, B(C) = 01. The lexicographic ordering
of these strings is B(B), B(C), B(A) [i.e. 00,01,1], so the coding does not preserve the original order
A, B, C. Therefore, algorithms like binary search might not work as expected on Huffman-coded data.

Given an ordered set S and Prob, you are to compute an ordered prefix code  one whose lexico-
graphic order preserves the order of S.

## Output

```text
Input consists of several data sets. Each set begins with 0 < n  100, the number of elements in S. n
lines follow; the i-th line gives the probability of ai, the i-th element of S. Each probability is given
as 0.dddd (that is, with exactly four decimal digits). The probabilities sum to 1.0000 exactly. A line
containing 0 follows the last data set.

## Sample Input

```text
For each data set, compute an optimal ordered binary prefix code for S. The output should consist of
one line giving the average code length, followed by n lines, with the i-th line giving the code for the
i-th element of S. If you have solved the problem, these n lines will be in lexicographic order. If there
are many optimal solutions, choose any one.

Output an empty line between cases.
