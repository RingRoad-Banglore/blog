title: Uva 12379  Central Post Office
---


```
One of the post services companies in a country plans to designate one of its branches as the central
office. The company has a branch in each and every city in the country. The cities are so connected by
roads that to go from any city to another, there is a unique sequence of roads to take. The central office
is in charge of dispatching parcels to all other branches. For this purpose, a car is used that starting
from the central office goes through all cities to the last one delivering their parcels. As time is always
a top priority in post services, the companys administration wants a designation which minimizes
dispatching times. If the car travels the distance between any two adjacent cities in one hour, calculate
the minimum total dispatching time Tm, considering the optimal designation.
