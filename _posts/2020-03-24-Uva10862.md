title: Uva 10862  Connect the Cable Wires
---


```
Asif is a student of East West University and he is currently working for the EWUISP to meet his
relatively high tuition fees. One day, as a part of his job, he was instructed to connect cable wires to N
houses. All the houses lie in a straight line. He wants to use only the minimum number of cable wires
required to complete his task such that all the houses receive the cable service. A house can either get
the connection from the main transmission center or it can get it from a house to its immediate left or
right provided the latter house is already getting the service.

You are to write a program that determines the number of different combinations of the cable wires
that is possible so that every house receives the service.

Example: If there are two houses then 3 combinations are possible as shown in the figure.

Figure: circles represent the transmission center and the small rectangles represent the houses.

## Input

```
Each line of input contains a positive integer N (N  2000). The meaning of N is described in the
above paragraph. A value of 0 for N indicates the end of input which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input you have to output, on a single line, the number of possible arrangements. You
can safely assume that this number will have less than 1000 digits.

```

## Sample Input

```
1
2
3
0

```

## Sample Output

```
1
3
8
