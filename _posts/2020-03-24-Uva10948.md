title: Uva 10948  The primary problem
---


```
Larry now lost most of his knowledge after spend-
ing a few years on deserted islands all over the place.
When Ryan brought up the fact that every even num-
ber greater than 3 can represented as the sum of two
prime numbers, he couldnt believe it! So now Larry
is trying to come up with some kind of counterexam-
ple, and you can help him!
```

## Input

```
Each line will contain an integer N greater than 3.
The input will terminate when N is 0. N will not be
bigger than 1 million.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one way of summing two prime numbers. If there are more than one set of
sums for which this is true, choose the set of sum the maximizes the difference between them. See the
sample output. If a number cannot be represented as the sum of two prime number, print NO WAY!
as below.
Note: 10 can be 3+7 or 5+5, and since 7-3 is bigger than 5-5, we choose 3+7.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
5
6
7
9
10
11
0

```

## Sample Output

```
4:
2+2
5:
2+3
6:
3+3
7:
2+5
9:
2+7
10:
3+7
