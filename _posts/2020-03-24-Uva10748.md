## Input

```text
Consider an infinite Chessboard. As the chessboard is infinite, each of its cells is denoted by two integers
(x, y). There are N knights in this chessboard. Each of these Knights can go certain steps. So, each
knight covers a certain part of the chessboard. It is possible that, one cell can be covered by more than
one knight. Even, two knights can be in the same position of the board.

You all know that a knight at (x, y) can go to (x 2, y  1) and (x 1, y  2) in next step. In this
problem, you will be given the description of N knights (its initial position and the steps it can travel
at most). You have to find the number of distinct cells covered by the N knights.
```

## Output

```text
Each input set starts with N (1  N  30) denoting the number of knights. In next few lines the
position (x, y) and the maximum number of steps k (0  k  50) of N knights will be given. The value
of x, y will be in the range 109 to +109. Input is terminated by N = 0. There will be at most 50 test
cases. There is a blank line between two consecutive sets.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print in a line the number of distinct cells, which can be traversed by any of N
knights.
