## Input

```text
Vincent Vega and his friend/partner Jules Winnfield are hitting the road in search of a person to make
a visit. Yes, they are both hitman, and theres a particular conversation going on right now, pay
attention to the details:
Vincent: You know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
Jules: What?
Vincent: Its the little differences. I mean they got the same things over there that they got here ...
but its just there, its a little different.
Jules: Example?
Vincent: You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer and I dont mean just like
in an old paper cup, im talkin about a glass of beer. In Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonalds.
Vincent: You know what they call a ... a ... a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
Jules: They dont call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese?
Vincent: No man, they got the metric system. They wouldnt know what a Quarter Pounder is.
Jules: Then what do they call it?
Vincent: They call it a Royale with cheese.
Jules: A Royale with cheese. What do they call a Big Mac?
Vincent: Well, a Big Macs a Big Mac, but they call it le Big-Mac.
Jules: Le Big-Mac. Ha ha ha ha. What do they call a Whopper?
Vincent: Well, a Whopper here its just a Whopper there. Some things never change ...

Interesting last words of Mr. Vincent Vega, because I went to Amsterdam last summer and there
is a peculiarity with the numbering system of houses. The funny thing about this system is that the
police have to decode the houses numbering system when they give information back to the police
station. Let me give you an example:

A house identified by the following id abbchocx, is identified by the police under the id = 15534239.
Each character that has not appeared previously in the sequence, takes an ascending numeric value,
starting in 1: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, h = 4, o = 5, x = 6. When a character has taken a numeric value,
every repetition of the character will have the same value. One last thing to take on count is that the
police love to exchange some digits: In the resultant id every 2 will become a 5, and every 6 will become
a 9 (in the same way, every 5 becomes a 2, and every 9 becomes a 6).

Its weird, I know. Its even weirder that from a trip I took last summer to Amsterdam, I have
knowledge of all that.

I guess the funny thing about Europe are in fact, the little differences.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains a string S with length n (1  n  105)
identifying a house in the weird numbering system implemented in Amsterdam. The string S is formed
only with 26 lowercase letters (a  z).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each id of a house in Amsterdams numbering system, you have to output a codified version of the
ID just as the police usually do. Each output goes on one line.
