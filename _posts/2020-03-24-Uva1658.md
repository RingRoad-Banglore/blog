```

Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter is the most famous admiral in Dutch history and is well known for his
role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. De Ruyter personally commanded a flagship and
issued commands to allied warships during naval battles.

In De Ruyters time, graph theory had just been invented and the admiral used it to his great
advantage in planning his naval battles. Waypoints at sea are represented by vertices, and possible
passages from one waypoint to another are represented as directed edges. Given any two waypoints
W1 and W2 , there is at most one passage W1  W2 . Each directed edge is marked with the number
of cannonballs that need to be fired in order to safely move a ship along that edge, sinking the enemy
ships encountered along the way.

One of De Ruyters most successful tactics was the De Ruyter Manoeuvre. Here, two warships start
at the same waypoint, and split up and fight their way through the enemy fleet, joining up again at a
destination waypoint. The manoeuvre prescribes that the two warships take disjunct routes, meaning
that they must not visit the same waypoint (other than the start and end-points), or use the same
passage during the battle.

Being Dutch, Admiral De Ruyter did not like to waste money; in 17th century naval warfare, this
meant firing as few expensive cannonballs as possible.

Figure 1: A particular instance of De Ruyters tactic, visualised as a graph. Two ships (red and
blue) move from a shared starting point (1) to a shared endpoint (6). The red ships route is 1  3  6
(firing 33 canonballs along the way); the blue ships route is 1  2  5  4  6 (firing 53 canonballs
along the way). In total, 86 canonballs are fired during the manoeuvre. Except for the start- and
end-point, no vertices or edges are visited by both ships.

## Input

```
For each test case, the input consists of:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1658  Admiral 2/2

 A line containing two integers v (3  v  1000) and e (3  e  10000), the number of waypoints
and passages, respectively.

 Then, e lines follow: for each passage, a line containing three integers:

1. ai (1  ai  v), the starting-point of a passage, which is represented by a waypoint;
2. bi (1  bi  v) and (ai = bi), the end-point of a passage, which is represented by a waypoint.

All passages are directed passages;

3. ci (1  ci  100), the number of cannonballs that are fired when travelling along this passage.

The starting waypoint is 1 and the destination waypoint is v. There are always at least two disjunct
routes from waypoint 1 to waypoint v.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output consists of a single positive integer: the smallest possible sum of cannon-
balls fired by both ships when reaching the destination waypoint.
