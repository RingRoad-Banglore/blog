title: Uva 11474  Dying Tree
---


## Input

```text

Once upon the time in the forest, there were lots of trees who were all friends to one another. One of
the trees T was very sick. She needed a tree doctor to save her life. As you may already know, trees
cant move, but what you probably didnt know is that they can talk. Each tree t1 can talk to tree t2
if the minimum distance between any two branches from each is less than or equal to some value k. All
trees decided to help their sick friend by trying to reach a doctor tree. They will continue to tell one
another that tree T is sick until some tree S finds a tree doctor (who is at distance d or less from any
branch of tree S). S will tell the doctor about her friend so he can go help her.

 A tree is represented by a set of points representing her branches.

 A doctor is represented by a single point.
```

## Output

```text
Input begins with a number t < 100 representing the number of test cases; t test cases follow. Each
test case begins with 4 integers 0 < n < 100, 0 < m  10, 0  k, d  100 where n is the number of
trees in the forest, m is the number of doctors in the forest, k & d are as described above. The next m
lines represent the positions of doctors in x, y coordinates. The following lines describe the set of trees
in the forest. Each set begins with an integer 0 < b < 10 representing the number of branches this tree
has. Followed by b points representing the branches positions. The sick tree is always the first tree in
the input. All points coordinates are integers with absolute values less than or equal to 1000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case determine whether or not the trees can help their friend by finding a doctor for her.
If yes, then print Tree can be saved :), if no then print Tree cant be saved :(.
