## Input

```text
Today Mr. Ed lent his phone to Ethan. He didnt lock his phone with password because he thought
Ethan is a reliable guy, but he wrote Im gay on Eds timeline. Obviously Mr. Ed is very pissed.

Due to the recent betrayal to his trust, Mr. Ed wants to lock his phone with a pattern. You know
what a phone unlock pattern is, right? The lock screen of a phone consists in a grid of n rows and m
columns of dots (or circles). Mr. Ed can choose any sequence of dots S = d1, d2, . . . , dk as the phone
unlock pattern; this means that, in order to unlock the phone, Ed needs to trace a path starting in d1
and ending in dk that passes along every dot in S in exactly the same order.

There are two restrictions to the sequence of dots S: first, every dot di must appear at most one
time in the sequence and; for every two consecutive dots in S, lets call them di and di+1, the straight
line from dot di to di+1 must not pass by any dot not previously visited in the sequence. For example,
in a 1 3 grid, the sequence S = 1, 3, 2 is not possible since the straight line from 1 to 3 passes through
2 (not visited yet).

Figure: Possible unlock patterns for a 1 3 grid using 1 dot (left), 2 dots (middle) and 3 dots (right).

The above figure illustrates the 11 possible unlock patterns for a lock screen of 1 3 dot grid; blue
dots represent the starting dot of the pattern and orange dots represent the respective end dot.

Please help Mr. Ed counting the number of unlock patterns he could use to lock his phone.

## Output

```text
The input will contain several test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with two integer
numbers 1  n  3 and 1  m  3: the number of rows and columns in the lock screen grid. The last
test case is followed by a single line containing 2 zeroes, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the number of possible unlock patterns Mr. Ed could use (see format below).

```

## Sample Output

```text
2 1
1 3
0 0
