title: Uva 01427  Parade

## Input

```

Panagola, The Lord of city F likes to parade very much. He always inspects his city in his car and
enjoys the welcome of his citizens. City F has a regular road system. It looks like a matrix with n+ 1
west-east roads and m + 1 north-south roads. Of course, there are (n + 1)  (m + 1) road crosses in
that system. The parade can start at any cross in the southernmost road and end at any cross in the
northernmost road. Panagola will never travel from north to south or pass a cross more than once.
Citizens will see Panagola along the sides of every west-east road. People who love Panagola will give
him a warm welcome and those who hate him will throw eggs and tomatoes instead. We call a road
segment connecting two adjacent crosses in a west-east road a love-hate zone. Obviously there are
m love-hate zones in every west-east road. When passing a love-hate zone, Panagola may get happier
or less happy, depending on how many people love him or hate him in that zone. So we can give every
love-hate zone a welcome value which may be negative, zero or positive. As his secretary, you must
make Panagola as happy as possible. So you have to find out the best route  of which the sum of the
welcome values is maximal. You decide where to start the parade and where to end it.

When seeing his Citizens, Panagola always waves his hands. He may get tired and need a break.
So please never make Panagola travel in a same west-east road for more than k minutes. If it takes p
minutes to pass a love-hate zone, we say the length of that love-hate zone is p. Of course you know
every love-hate zones length.

## Output

```
There are multiple test cases. Input ends with a line containing three zeros.

Each test case consists of 2 n+ 3 lines.
The first line contains three integers: n, m and k. (0 < n  100, 0 < m  10000, 0  k  3000000)
The next n+1 lines stands for n+1 west-east roads in north to south order. Each line contains m

integers showing the welcome values of the roads m love-hate zones, in west to east order.

The last n+1 lines also stands for n+1 west-east roads in north to south order. Each line contains
m integers showing the lengths (in minutes) of the roads m love-hate zones, in west to east order.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the sum of welcome values of the best route. The answer can be fit in a 32
bits integer.

Note: The figure on the right illustrates the
case in sample input. In this figure, a best route
is marked by thicker lines.
