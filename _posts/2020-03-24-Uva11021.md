## Input

```
GRAVITATION, n.

The tendency of all bodies to approach one another with a strength
proportion to the quantity of matter they contain  the quantity of

matter they contain being ascertained by the strength of their tendency
to approach one another. This is a lovely and edifying illustration of

how science, having made A the proof of B, makes B the proof of A.

Ambrose Bierce

You have a population of k Tribbles. This particular species of Tribbles live for exactly one day and
then die. Just before death, a single Tribble has the probability Pi of giving birth to i more Tribbles.
What is the probability that after m generations, every Tribble will be dead?
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a line
containing n (1  n  1000), k (0  k  1000) and m (0  m  1000). The next n lines will give the
probabilities P0, P1, . . . , Pn1.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the answer, correct up to an
absolute or relative error of 106.
