The University of Calgary team qualified for the 28th ACM
International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals in
Prague, Czech Republic. Just by using the initials of team mem-
bers they got a very cunning team name: ACM (Alecs, Celly
and Monny). In order to prepare for the contest, they have de-
cided to travel to Edmonton to learn the tricks of trade from
Dilbert, Alberta-wide famous top-coder.

Due to a horrible miscommunication which is as welcome as
a plague among such teams, A, C and M drive from Calgary
to Edmonton in separate cars. To make things worse, there was
also a miscommunication with D, who being always so helpful,
decides to go to Calgary in order to save the team a trip to the
far, freezing North. All this happens on the same day and each
car travels at a constant (but not necessarily the same) speed on
the famous Alberta #2.

Then A passed C and M at time t1 and t2, respectively, and
met D at time t3. D met C and M at times t4 and t5, respectively.
The question is: at what time did C pass M?
```

## Input

```
The input is a sequence of lines, each containing times t1, t2, t3, t4 and t5, separated by white space.
All times are distinct and given in increasing order. Each time is given in the hh : mm : ss format on
the 24-hour clock. A line containing -1 terminates the input.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output giving the time when C passed M in the same format
as input, rounding the seconds in the standard way.

```
