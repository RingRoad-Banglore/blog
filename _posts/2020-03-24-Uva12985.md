title: Uva 12985  Ba Gua Zhen
---


## Input

```text
During the Three-Kingdom period, there was a general named Xun Lu who belonged to Kingdom Wu.
Once his troop were chasing Bei Liu, he was stuck in the Ba Gua Zhen from Liang Zhuge. The puzzle
could be considered as an undirected graph with N vertexes and M edges. Each edge in the puzzle
connected two vertexes which were ui and vi with a length of wi. Liang Zhuge had great interests in
the beauty of his puzzle, so there were no self-loops and between each pair of vertexes, there would
be at most one edge in the puzzle. And it was also guaranteed that there was at least one path to go
between each pair of vertexes.

Fortunately, there was an old man named Chengyan Huang who was willing to help Xun Lu to hack
the puzzle. Chengyan told Xun Lu that he had to choose a vertex as the start point, then walk through
some of the edges and return to the start point at last. During his walk, he could go through some edges
any times. Since Liang Zhuge had some mysterious magic, Xun Lu could hack the puzzle if and only
if he could find such a path with the maximum XOR sum of all the edges length he has passed. If the
he passed some edge multiple times, the length would also be calculated by multiple times. Now, could
you tell Xun Lu which is the maximum XOR circuit path in this puzzle to help him hack the puzzle?

## Output

```text
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T (1  T  30). T test cases follow.

Each test case begins with two integers N (2  N  5  104) and M (1  M  105) in one line.
Then M lines follow. Each line contains three integers ui, vi and wi (1  ui, vi  N , 0  wi  260  1)
to describe all the edges in the puzzle.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting
from 1) and y is the maximum XOR sum of one circuit path in the puzzle.

Note: A XOR takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR operation
on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 or only the
second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1. In this we perform the comparison of two bits,
being 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.
