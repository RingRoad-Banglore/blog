## Input

```text

Xi, a developmental biologist is working on developmental distances of chromosomes. A chromosome,
in the Xis simplistic view, is a permutation from n genes numbered 1 to n. Xi is working on an
evolutionary distance metric between two chromosomes. In Xis theory of evolution any subset of genes
lying together in both chromosomes is a positive witness for chromosomes to be similar.

A positive witness is a pair of sequence of the same length A and A, where A is a consecutive
subsequence of the first chromosome, A is a consecutive subsequence of the second chromosome, and A
is a permutation of A. The goal is to count the number of positive witnesses of two given chromosomes
that have a length greater than one.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test case in the input. Each test case starts with a line containing the number of genes
(2  n  3000). The next two lines contain the two chromosomes, each as a list of positive integers.
The input terminates with a line containing 0 which should not be processed as a test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of positive witness for two chromosomes
to be similar.
