title: Uva 11008  Antimatter Ray Clearcutting
---


## Input

```text
Its year 2465, and you are the Chief Engineer for Glorified Lumberjacks Inc. on planet Trie. There is a
number of trees that you need to cut down, and the only weapon you have is a high-powered antimatter
ray that will cut through trees like butter. Fuel cells for the antimatter ray are very expensive, so your
strategy is: stand somewhere in the forest and shoot the ray in some chosen direction. This will cut
down all the trees that lie on the line in that direction. Given the locations of several trees and the
number of trees that you are required to cut, what is the minimum number of shots that you need to
fire?
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (at most 20). N test cases follow. Each one starts
with 2 lines containing the integers n (the number of trees in the forest, at most 16) and m (the number
of trees you need to cut, at most n). The next n lines will each give the (x,y) coordinates of a tree
(integers in the range [1000, 1000]).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the line Case #x:, where x is the number of the test case. On the next
line, print the number of antimatter ray shots required to cut down at least m trees. Print an empty
line between test cases.

Notes:
In the first test case, you can cut down 4 trees by standing at (0, -1) and firing north (cutting 2

trees) and then standing at (1, -1) and again firing north (cutting 2 more trees).
In the second test case, you should stand at (3,-1) and fire north (cutting 4 trees) and then stand

at (-1, -1) and fire north-east (cutting 3 more trees).
