title: Uva 11272  Summing the Lengths of Longest Increasing Subse-
---


## Input

```text
quences of Permutations

Compute the sum of the lengths of the longest increasing subsequence of each distinct permutation of
(1, 2, 3, . . . , n).

In other words, sum over all permutations, w of (1, 2, 3, . . . , n), LIS(w). Where LIS(w) is the
length of the longest increasing subsequence of w. However, this number increases exponentially. In
the problem we are interested only in the first three digits. Also, note that each subsequence does not
have to be contiguous. For example, the longest increasing subsequence of (3,2,4,1,5) is (3,4,5) with
length 3.

Hint: You may want to compute a few small values and find a beautiful pattern!!!

## Output

```text
The input will consist of at most 100000 lines, each one with just the positive integer n (100 < n <
100000000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input value, output the first three digits of the sum of the lengths of the longest increasing
subsequence of each permuation of (1, 2, 3, . . . , n).

```

## Sample Output

```text
101
1101
2101

```
