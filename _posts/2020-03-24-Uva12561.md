title: Uva 12561  Hadamard Gate

## Input

```text
If you know a little bit of quantum computers, this problem is:

Given n Hadamard Gates in series and an input qubit, predict the measurement of the output.

If you dont know about quantum computers, keep on reading.
In quantum physics, superposition principle states that if a quantum system (e.g. an electron) can

be in one of two states (denoted by |0 and |1), it can also be in any linear superposition of those two
states a|0 + b|1, where a and b are two complex numbers, normalized so that |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. Such a
superposition, a|0+ b|1, is the basic unit of encoded information in quantum computers, called qubit
(pronounced cubit).

An elementary quantum operation is analogous to an elementary gate like the AND or NOT gate
in classical circuit. One of the most important examples is the Hadamard gate, denoted by H, which
operates on a single qubit. On input |1 or |0, it outputs:

H(|1) =
1

2
|0 

1

2
|1

H(|0) =
1

2
|0+

1

2
|1

Due to linearity of quantum physics, the output for an arbitrary superposition a|0+b|1 is aH(|0)+
bH(|1).

However, the linear superposition is the private world of the quantum system. For us to get a glimpse
of its state, we must make a measurement, and when we do so, we get a single bit of information  0
or 1. If the state is a|0 + b|1, then the outcome of the measurement is 0 with probability |a|2 and 1
with probability |b|2 (luckily we normalized so |a|2 + |b|2 = 1).

## Output

```text
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case contains a single line of
format a0 a1 b0 b1 n, where a0, a1, b0, b1 are real numbers with at most 4 decimal places, denoting a
qubit (a0 + a1i)|0+ (b0 + b1i)|1, and n (1  n  106) is the number of Hadamard Gates.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the probability that the measurement is 0, to 6 decimal places.

```

## Sample Output

```text

1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1
0.017133 0.704420 0.410273 0.578943 1
