## Input

```text
Masud Rana, A Daring Spy Of Bangladesh Counter Intelligence. He is in a new mission. There is a
total n cities in Bangladesh. Each city is connected to all other by bidirectional roads. So there are
total n  (n  1)/2 bidirectional roads. Many of the roads are under control of evil powers. City a is
safely reachable from city b, if there is a path from a to b containing only roads which are not under
control of evil powers. There are m roads which are safe from evil powers. The mission of Masud Rana
is to destroy the evil powers of some roads, and make sure that every city is safely reachable from all
other.

Masud Rana chose a new strategy for this special mission. Every morning he selects a random city
other than the city he stays in at that moment, and visit that city by direct connecting road, in the
time of his visit by the road he destroys all evil power of that road if exists any, and makes that road
safe. After reaching new city, he stays there till next morning. In the next morning he checks whether
all cities are safely reachable from all others. If he is already done his mission ends, otherwise he repeats
same strategy.

Let us number the cities by 1, 2, , n. Masud Rana is in city 1 when he starts his mission.
