title: Uva 11104  Cousins
---


## Input

```text
Two strings a and b are defined to be first
cousins if they can be made equal by remov-
ing no more than half the characters from each.
For example abcdef and axcyd are first
cousins because we can remove 3 of the 6 char-
acters (b,e,f) from the first string and 2 of the
5 characters in the second string (x,y) resulting
in acd. Two strings c and d are said to be
n+1-st cousins if there exists a string e that is
a first cousin of c and is an N -th cousin of d.

Given two strings x and y, determine the
smallest n  1 such that x is an n-th cousin of
y.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines representing x and y. x and y
each consist of at least 1 and at most 100 lower case letters. Two lines containing 0 follow the last
test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing n or not related if x and y are not n-th cousins for any
n.

```

## Sample Output

```text
a
b
abb
baa
abcdef
axcyd
0
0

```
