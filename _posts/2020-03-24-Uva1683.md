title: Uva 01683  In case of failure
---


## Input

```text

To help their clients deal with faulty Cash Machines, the board of The Planar Bank has decided to
stick a label expressing sincere regret and sorrow of the bank about the failure on every ATM. The very
same label would gently ask the customer to calmly head to the nearest Machine (that should hopefully
work fine).

In order to do so, a list of two-dimensional locations of all n ATMs has been prepared, and your
task is to find for each of them the one closest with respect to the Euclidean distance.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. The very first line contains the number of cases t (t  15) that
follow. Each test cases begin with the number of Cash Machines n (2  n  105). Each of the next n
lines contain the coordinates of one Cash Machine x, y (0  x, y  109) separated by a space. No two
points in one test case will coincide.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output n lines. i-th of them should contain the squared distance between the i-th
ATM from the input and its nearest neighbour.
