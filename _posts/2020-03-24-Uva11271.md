title: Uva 11271  Lattice of Resistors
---


```
Given an infinite 2D Lattice of resisters as shown below, where the resistance on each edge between
neighboring junctions is exactly 1. Pick any junction O and assign the coordinate (0,0). What is the
total resistance between O and some other junction J = (i, j)?

Hint: There is a surprising Dynamic Programming solution, but how do you get it to fit under the
memory requirement? :-) .
```

## Input

```
A number of inputs. One testcase on each line. The input of each test case is simply the values i, j on
a single line. All values will fit inside an unsigned 64 bit integer.

```

## Output

```
For each input value, output the total resistance between O and J on a single line. Round to 3 digits
after the decimal.
