title: Uva 12043  Divisors
---


```
Let us define the functions d(n) and (n) as

d(n) = number of divisors of n
(n) = summation of divisors of n

Here divisors of n include both 1 and n. For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. So d(6) = 4
and (n) = 12.

Now let us define two more function g(a, b, k) and h(a, b, k) as

g(a, b, k) =

i

d(i)

h(a, b, k) =

i

(i)

Where a  i  b and i is divisible by k.
For example, g(5, 12, 3) = d(6)+d(9)+d(12) = 4+3+6 = 13 and h(5, 12, 3) = (6)+(9)+(12) =

13 + 13 + 28 = 53. Given a, b, k you have to calculate g(a, b, k) and h(a, b, k).
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer T (T  75) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

Three integers in a line. First integer is contains a, second integer is b and third integer is k. You
may assume 0 < a  b  105, 0 < k < 2000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case print one line containing g(a, b, k) and h(a, b, k) separated by a space as defined
above.

```

## Sample Input

```

5 12 3
1 100 3

```

## Sample Output

```
13 53
217 3323
