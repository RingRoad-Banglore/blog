title: Uva 12954  Spiral
---


## Input

```text
Given a N  N grid, we would like to place beans, one in each
square, following a spiral as shown in the picture. Starting from
the upper-left square, with coordinates (1, 1), and then going to
the right until possible, then down until possible, then left until
possible and then up until possible. We repeat this pattern, right-
downleft-up, until B beans are placed into the grid. The problem
is: given N and B, at which coordinates will the last bean be
placed? In the picture, for N = 8 and B = 53, the last bean is
placed at coordinates (4, 6).
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. A test case consists of a
single line containing two integers, N and B, where 2  N  230
and 1  B  N2.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input your program must output one line containing two integers, R and C,
where (R,C) are the coordinates of the last bean.

```

## Sample Output

```text
8 53
