title: Uva 13041  Fraction and Sequence
---


## Input

```
An infinite integer sequence (S) can be generated from the following quadratic equation

S(x) = ax2 + bx+ c [a, b, c are non-negative integers] and x = 0   (x is integer)

S(x) is the x-th element of sequence S.
For example, if a = 0, b = 1 and c = 0, then S(x) = x

So the sequence will be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, . . .
A fraction p/q (p and q are relatively prime) is associated with the sequence S in such way that

(explained in right)
In summary, for a given triplet a, b, c there will be a sequence S and for

a sequence S there will be a fraction p/q
But for this problem fraction p/q will be given. You have to find out how

many integer triples (a, b, c) exist for some given limit L where 0  a, b, c  L.
```

## Output

```
Given T ( 104) denoting number of test cases. Each case consists of 3
positive integers p, q and L.

p and q are relatively prime to each other.
L is the maximum value for a, b, c. Denominator q > 1 and p, q  107 and L  105

```

## Sample Input

```
You have to report the number of integer triples (a, b, c) that can be formed where 0  a, b, c  L.

See sample Input output for format.
