---


```

Given an integer N ( 1016) find its prime factoring.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains T ( 800), the number of test cases. Then the next T lines contains
an integer N (1 < N  1016).

```

## Output

```
For every test case output its prime factoring representation. See the sample output for the output
format.

```

## Sample Input

```
3

60

36

10007

```

## Sample Output

```

60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5

36 = 2^2 * 3^2

10007 = 10007
```
