title: Uva 11330  Andys Shoes
---


```
Andy has n pairs of shoes in n different
colors. At the end of the day he likes to
put them back on his shoe rack. He has
learned to always put a left shoe together
with a right shoe. However, he has not
learned about putting pairs of shoes with
the same color together. Papas job is to
pair up the shoes. Since Papa is tired
from work at the algorithm factory, he
wants to do this in the minimal number
of steps. One step means to swap two
shoes.

Your job is to help Papa.

## Input

```
As usual, the first line contains the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line starting
with total number of pairs of shoes n. The following 2n numbers describe the initial arrangement of
shoes on the rack. Each shoe is labeled by a positive integer at most 10,000 where two shoes share the
same label if and only if they are part of the same pair. Both the left and right shoes of a given pair
will be present (remember that left and right shoes alternate).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one line containing a single number  the minimum number of swaps needed
to pair up all shoes.
