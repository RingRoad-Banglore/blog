## Input

```text
Bangladesh became independent in 16-th December 1971 after more than two decades of struggle and
with a nine month long war. This war is often referred to as the Liberation War. During the liberation
war Bangladesh was divided into 11 sectors. Every sector was under the control of a sector commander
who directed the freedom fighter. Most of the sector also had some opponent soldiers. In that time, the
sector commander faced a serious problem. They were not being able to count accurately how many
freedom fighters and opponent groups were there in each sector and also how many groups are still in
fighting. According to this information all sector commander will make a decision about their future
planning. They took the help of a programmer during that time. The programmer solved the problem
and played a vital role in proper planning of the war. 32 years have passed since the glorious Liberation
War of Bangladesh. As a programmer, you are committed to find again a way of solving the problem.

In the figure the area bordered by a rectangle indicates a sector. In the input to your program
a sector may contain any of the three characters *, B, P. Here B indicates the locations where
there are some freedom fighters, P indicates the places occupied by enemy forces and the locations
occupied by none of them are identified by some *. In a sector all the B, P or * are connected either
horizontally or vertically. Within a sector there may be one or more freedom fighter group or enemy
group. Each of the freedom fighter groups will be identified by some B connected to another vertically
or horizontally. Similarly enemy groups will be identified by the character P. No two sectors will have
a connection either horizontally or vertically. There may be some . (dots) to separate two sectors. In
the above picture we can see that there are two (2) groups in a sector. If a group is horizontally or
vertically connected to an opponent group then this two groups are said to be in fighting position. It
is granted that a freedom fighter group can fight only one opponent group at a time.
