title: Uva 11676  Deadly Atack
---


## Input

```text
Since the King of Nlogonia built, decades earlier, an enormous protecting wall around the whole king-
dom, its inhabitants have lived safely. The wall is massive, extremely reinforced, and has the format
of a circle, enclosing all the Kings domains.

However, in recent weeks inhabitants of Nlogonia are upset. There are rumors that scientists from
Quadradonia, a barbaric nation in Nlogonias neighborhood, have developed a lethal weapon, capable
of blowing away anything on its reach.

The new weapon is a cannon that emits a beam of protons that spread with an angle from the
cannons mouth. The beams direction is determined by an angle , measured counterclockwise from the
x axis. The figure below illustrates (a) an example of an atack, (b) what would remain from Nlogonia
and (c) the area that would be destroyed.

Given the cannons coordinates, the beams direction and spread angle, as well as the coordinate of
the walls center and radius, you must write a program to calculate the area of Nlogonia that will be
destroyed.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by two lines. The first line contains
three integers X, Y , R, with (X,Y ) representing the coordinates of the protection walls center (0 
X  1000 and 0  Y  1000), and radius (1  R  100). The second line contains four integers P ,
Q, A and T , with (P,Q) representing the cannons coordinates (0  P  1000 and 0  Q  1000), A
representing the beams direction, in degrees (0  A  359), and T representing the spread angle, also
in degrees (1  T  179). The angle A is measured counter-clockwise from the x axis, and the cannon
is always outside the protecting wall.

The end of input is indicated by a line which contains three zeros, separated by single spaces.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input your program should print a single line, containing a real number, written
with a precision of one decimal place, indicating the area of Nlogonia that would be destroyed by the
atack.
