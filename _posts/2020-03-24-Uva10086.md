title: Uva 10086  Test the Rods
---


```
National Construction and Project Centre (NCPC) and the Bureau of Civil Engineering Works (BCEW)
have been given the authority of testing and certifying the quality of rods used in construction works
in the country. The Get and Do construction company has recently got a contract of construction at
different sites of the country. Before the construction can start they want to get the rods from their
n sites tested either at NCPC or at BCEW. Get and Do has got the permission of testing T1 rods at
NCPC and T2 at BCEW. There are mi samples at site i (1  i  n). Sum total of these samples over
all the n sites is just equal to (T1 + T2). The cost of testing j items from site i at NCPC is Ci,j,1 and
that of testing at BCEW is Ci,j,2. Write a program to find a minimum cost testing schedule for the Get
and Do company.
```

## Input

```
The input may contain multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains the two nonnegative
integers T1 and T2 (1  T1 + T2  300). The next line contains n (1  n  30). Then follow 3n lines.
For 1  i  n, line (3i2) contains the value of mi (1  mi  20), line (3i1) contains mi nonnegative
integers Ci,j,1 (1  j  mi) and line 3i contains mi nonnegative integers Ci,j,2 (1  j  mi). You may
assume that 0  Ci,j,1, Ci,j,2  1000.

A test case containing two zeros for T1 and T2 terminates the input, and this case must not be
processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case in the input print two lines. The first line contains an integer giving the minimum cost
for testing all the samples at NCPC and BCEW. The next line contains n integers with two consecutive
integers separated by a single space. The i-th integer gives the numbers of samples from site i that are
tested at NCPC (it is implicit that the rest are tested at BCEW). Note that the second output line is
not unique, and hence any optimal testing schedule is acceptable.

Print a blank line after the outputs of each test case.
