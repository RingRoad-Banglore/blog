## Input

```
In these days you can more and more often happen to see programs which perform some useful calcu-
lations being executed rather then trivial screen savers. Some of them check the system message queue
and in case of finding it empty (for examples somebody is editing a file and stays idle for some time)
execute its own algorithm.

As an examples we can give programs which calculate primary numbers.

One can also imagine a program which calculates a factorial of given numbers. In this case it is not
the time complexity of order O(n) which makes troubles, but the memory requirements. Considering
the fact that 500! gives 1135-digit number. No standard, neither integer nor floating, data type is
applicable here.

Your task is to write a programs which calculates a factorial of a given number.
```

## Output

```
Any number of lines, each containing value n for which you should provide value of n!

```

## Sample Input

```
2 lines for each input case. First should contain value n followed by character !. The second should
contain calculated value n!.

Assumptions:

 Value of a number n which factorial should be calculated of does not exceed 1000 (although 500!
is the name of the problem, 500 is a small limit).

 Mind that visually big number of case 4 is broken after 80 characters, but this is not the case in
the real output file.

```

## Sample Output

```
10
30
50
100

```
