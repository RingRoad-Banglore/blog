title: Uva 12480  Just Some Permutations
---


## Input

```text
Dexter considers a permutation of first N positive numbers (1, 2, , N) beautiful if all the absolute
differences between adjacent numbers in the permutation are distinct.

So for N = 4: {3, 2, 4, 1} is a beautiful permutation because the absolute differences are {1, 2,
3}. But {3, 1, 4, 2} is not beautiful since the absolute differences {2, 3, 2} are not distinct.

Given N and K find the lexicographically K-th smallest beautiful permutation of the first N pos-
itive numbers. A permutation of N numbers A1, A2, , An is lexicographically smaller than another
permutation B1, B2, , Bn if Ai < Bi for some i and Aj = Bj for all j < i.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains an integer T ( 1000) which is the number of test cases. Each of the
next T lines contain two space separated integers N (1 < N < 20) and K (1  K  109).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output the case number and then N space separated integers which is the lexico-
graphically K-th smallest beautiful permutation of first N positive numbers. If there are less than K
beautiful permutations then output -1. See sample output for exact formatting.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4
5 1
5 2
5 4
5 10
