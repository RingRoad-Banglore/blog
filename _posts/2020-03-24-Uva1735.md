title: Uva 01735  The Hypnotic Spirals
---


```
Professor Parinita Pratim Das, a brilliant
Mathematician of this era, dreams of winning
the Fields Medal someday for her patented Spi-
rals that are custom made to hypnotize Engi-
neers. To show that her ideas actually work
she wants to paint her office room walls with
various shapes of spirals.

Her method of drawing spirals goes some-
thing like this:

 She picks a spiral (in polar coordinates)
of the form, r = a

 Then she adds n rays shooting out from
the origin  the i-th ray being of the form
 = bi (positive or counter clockwise angle
with the x axis)

 Finally she marks out m points (rj , j) 
if a point is in a bounded region then that
entire region will be painted black.

The spiral on the right is one such example. The following figure illustrates the construction steps
of this spiral.

Professor Das computes r in meters and knows that she needs 1 liter of black paint for per 10 meter2
area on the wall. She needs your help to calculate how much paint she needs to buy.

## Input

```
The input for this problem starts with S (S  100), the number of spirals Professor Das wants to paint.

Each of the hypnotic spirals is described in three lines. The first line of a spirals description gives
a floating point number giving the value of a (0 < a < 10).

The next line starts with the value of integer n (0  n  10). Then follows n floating-point number
i, 0  i < 2, each giving the  values for the n rays. You can assume that all the i values are
unique (Differs by at least 0.01).

The last line of spirals description start with the value of m (0  m  1000). The next m pairs
of floating-point numbers, (rj, j), 0 < rj < 100, 0  j < 2, in the line gives the coordinates of the
points which Professor Das mark out for painting. You can assume that none of the points will be on
the spirals curve or on any of the rays. Note that all the  values in the input will be given in radians.

## Output

```
For each test case print the spirals number (in the format shown in the sample output). Then print the
amount of black paint (in liters, rounded to 4 digits after the decimal point) needed to paint that spiral
on Professor Das wall. If the region to be painted is unbounded, print a -1 instead. The amount of
black paint will be such that an error of 5 108 will not change the printed output.
