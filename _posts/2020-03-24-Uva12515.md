## Input

```text
Movie Police (MP) is an international top secret law enforcement agency, controlling illegal movie
downloads on internet. With their elite team of programmers, MP has developed a very smart algorithm
to produce movie signatures. A movie signature is a binary string, one bit for every frame in the movie,
so that the i-th bit in the signature corresponds to the i-th frame in the movie. The algorithm is so
amazing that it outputs consistently the same signature for versions of the same film with different
quality resolutions. One application of this revolutionary technology uses it to detect if a small clip is
part of a movie, looking for a high similarity between the clip signature and the movie signature.

Now MP has started to apply this technology and, as a first step, a massive online database of
movie signatures was already built. As a new member of the MP crew, you must write a program that,
given the signature of a clip, finds the index in the MP database of a movie whose signature matches
the clip signature at most. That is, a movie whose signature has a substring, of the same length of the
clip signature, that is most similar to the clip signature.

Similarity between strings of the same length is defined by means of their Hamming distance (number
of bits that do not match), so that more similar means less Hamming distance.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains two positive integer numbers M and Q, separated by a blank,
where M indicates the number of movie signatures in the database and Q indicates the number of clip
signatures to process (1  M  1000, 1  Q  500). Each one of the following M lines contains a
binary string si describing the i-th movie signature in the database. You may suppose that si has length
li, where 1  li  100. Finally, there are Q lines, each one with a binary string that corresponds to a
clip signature to search for maximal similarity in the database. You may assume that, for every clip
signature to be searched, there is at least one movie signature in the database whose length is greater
or equal than the clips length.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each clip signature given in the input, output a single line with the lowest index i of a movie si
(1  i  M) that matches the clip at most, as above explained. If there are two movie signatures that
match the clip signature maximally, answer the one with lower index in the database.
