title: Uva 01727  Counting Weekend Days
---


```
The contestants probably dont know how eagerly problem-setters
(The people who prepare problems for a programming contest)
wait for the weekend to make problems that would terrorize con-
testants :-). So before a month begins, some problem-setters try
to calculate the number of weekend days in that month and plans
accordingly. Can you help them to calculate this?

There are seven days in a week namely Sunday (SUN), Mon-
day (MON), Tuesday (TUE), Wednesday (WED), Thursday
(THU), Friday (FRI) and Saturday (SAT). There are twelve months in a year, January (JAN),
February (FEB), March (MAR), April (APR), May (MAY), June (JUN), July (JUL), August
(AUG), September (SEP), October (OCT), November (NOV) and December (DEC). These months
have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30 and 31 days respectively. In leap years, the month of
February has 29 days. In the bracket the three letter code for each month and each day are shown.
Unlike many countries of the world Friday (FRI) and Saturday (SAT) are considered weekend days in
Bangladesh. Given a month and the name of the first day of that month, you will have to find out the
total no of weekend days in that month.
```

## Input

```
First line contains an integer T (T  100) which denotes the number of test cases. The input for each
set is given in a single line. This line contains two strings MTH and DAY , here MTH is the three
digit code of the month and DAY is the three digit code for the name of the first day of that Month.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. It contains a single integer which denotes the number
of weekend days (Fridays and Saturdays) in that month. You must do your calculation assuming that
the year is not a leapleap year.

Illustration of third sample input:
In the third sample input we are asked to count the number

of weekend days of a month October whose first day (October 1)
is Thursday. The calendar on the left depicts this and it can be
seen that there are 10 weekend days (colored red) in this month.
