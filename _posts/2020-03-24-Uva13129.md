title: Uva 13129  Subsets
---


```
Ailin just learned to generate all subsets of a set. This procedure is very easy when the number of
elements in the set is small, but what if you have very large sets? Thats because she wants to practice
what she learned, so the next problem arises: She have an array of N numbers and Q queries, each of
them with two values A and B. She selects the values from positions A, A + 1, A + 2, . . . , B  1, B
and generates all possible subsets with those values. then she rises by the exponent P to the sum of
each subset. Finally she adds the partial results of that operation and write down the answer.

Consider an example: the array is [3, 5, 2, 7] and A = 1, B = 3, P = 2, she selects values 3, 5, 2
and generates all subsets follows: {3}, {5}, {2}, {3, 5}, {3, 2}, {5, 2}, {3, 5, 2}. Now she raises P = 2
to the sum of each subset: 23, 25, 22, 23+5 = 28, 23+2 = 25, 25+2 = 27, 23+5+2 = 210. Finally, she adds
partial results: 23 + 25 + 22 + 28 + 25 + 27 + 210 = 8 + 32 + 4 + 256 + 32 + 128 + 1024 = 1484.

She soon realizes that this task is very complicated so she asks you for help in order to calculate
the answers. Will you be able to do this?

## Input

```
There are several cases. The first line of each case contains two numbers N and P (1  N  5105,
2  P  105). The next line contains N positive integers ai (1  ai  109, 1  i  N) the array
elements. Then follows another line with the integer Q, the number of queries (1  Q  5105). The
following Q lines each contain two integers A and B (1  A  B  N). Assume that all the elements
ai will be different.

```

## Output

```
Print a line for each query. Since the sum may be too high, print the result modulo 109 + 7.

```

## Sample Input

```
4 2
3 5 2 7

1 3

```

## Sample Output
