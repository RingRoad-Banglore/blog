title: Uva 01095  Contour Mapping
---


## Input

```text
A contour map represents the topography of a given region. Lines on a contour map represent constant
elevations. For example, a contour map might contain a line that represents points with an elevation
of 100 meters above mean sea level, another line representing 200 meters elevation, and so on.

The Association for Contour Mapping (ACM) needs a program to produce contour maps from data
files containing elevation measurements collected by a satellite. They are especially interested in the
total length of all contour lines on each map. The elevation data is in the form of sequences of integers
that represent elevations measured at regular intervals along scan lines that run from west to east. The
spacing of the scan lines is such that each elevation measurement in the interior of the data set has six
nearest neighbors and is equidistant from them (when elevation is ignored), as shown in Figure 5 and
Figure 6.

The policy of the ACM is to approximate the actual terrain by a set of triangles constructed by
connecting each elevation measurement to its nearest neighbors by straight line segments. Each of these
triangles is then treated as a planar surface, where the plane is determined by the coordinates, including
elevation, of the vertices. If the triangles are projected onto the zero-elevation plane, they form a set
of equilateral triangles.

In the figures above, the black numbers represent elevation data and the red dashed lines and
numbers represent contour lines. Figure 5 contains a single contour line at elevation 5. Figure 6
contains multiple contour lines at elevations 6 and 9. A contour line may pass through the interior of
a triangle or run along an edge of a triangle.

Because of the way the data points are interlaced, even-numbered scan lines contain one more data
point than odd-numbered scan lines. In each figure, the first scan line is shown at the top.

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases, each containing a set of elevation data. Each test case begins
with a line containing four integers as follows:

 s (2  s  100) is the number of scan lines of data in the test case.

 p (1  p  100) is the number of elevation measurements on the odd numbered scan lines. The
evennumbered scan lines contain p+ 1 elevation measurements.

 d (1  d  10) is the distance between each elevation measurement and its nearest neighbors
when elevation is ignored (equals the side-length of the equilateral triangles in the figures.)

 h (1  h  1000) is the elevation increment between contour lines in the desired map. The final
contour map contains a contour line wherever the elevation is an exact multiple of h. Note that
a map may contain multiple contour lines for a given elevation. Where a region is level, contour
lines are shown only for the boundaries. (See for example the contour line of elevation 9 in Figure
6.)

The first line of each test case is followed by additional lines containing elevation data as a sequence
of nonnegative integers no larger than 106. The first p integers represent the elevation measurements
on the first scan line, from left to right. The next p+ 1 integers represent the elevation measurements
on the second scan line, reading from left to right. The data continues in order, providing p integers for
each odd-numbered scan line and p+1 integers for each even-numbered scan line, until all the elevation
data has been provided. Each test case ends with an empty line.

The input is terminated with a line containing a single zero.
