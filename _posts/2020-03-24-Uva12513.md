title: Uva 12513  Safe Places
---


```
There are n kinds (i.e. type-1, type-2, , type-n) of m satellites in the space. For each 1  i  n, all
the type-i satellites are working together to protect their minimal enclosing convex polyhedron (though
its volume might be zero). If a point is protected by at least k kinds of satellites, we say this point is
safe.

Find the volume of all safe places (it might be zero).
```

## Input

```
The first line contains T (T  25), the number of test cases. Each test case begins with three integers
n, k and m (1  k  n  5, 4  m  50). Each of the following m lines contains an integer t and three
real numbers x, y, z, representing a type-t satellite at (x, y, z) (1  t  n, 0  x, y, z  10). Each test
case is terminated by a blank line

Note: The coordinates of satellites in the judge input (not sample input) are randomly generated.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the volume rounded to 5 decimal places after the decimal point.
