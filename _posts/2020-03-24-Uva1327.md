## Input

```text

Once upon a time there lived a king and he had N sons. And there were N beautiful girls in the
kingdom and the king knew about each of his sons which of those girls he did like. The sons of the king
were young and light-headed, so it was possible for one son to like several girls.

So the king asked his wizard to find for each of his sons the girl he liked, so that he could marry
her. And the kings wizard did it  for each son the girl that he could marry was chosen, so that he
liked this girl and, of course, each beautiful girl had to marry only one of the kings sons.

However, the king looked at the list and said: I like the list you have made, but I am not completely
satisfied. For each son I would like to know all the girls that he can marry. Of course, after he marries
any of those girls, for each other son you must still be able to choose the girl he likes to marry.

The problem the king wanted the wizard to solve had become too hard for him. You must save
wizards head by solving this problem.
