title: Uva 11990  Dynamic Inversion
---


## Input

```text
You are given a permutation {1,2,3,,n}. Remove m of them one by one, and output the number of
inversion pairs before each removal. The number of inversion pairs of an array A is the number of
ordered pairs (i, j) such that i < j and A[i] > A[j].
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. The first line of each case contains two integers n and m (1  n 
200, 000, 1  m  100, 000). After that, n lines follow, representing the initial permutation. Then m
lines follow, representing the removed integers, in the order of the removals. No integer will be removed
twice. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each removal, output the number of inversion pairs before it.

Explanation: (1,5,3,4,2)->(1,3,4,2)->(3,4,2)->(3,2)->(3)

```

## Sample Output

```text
5 4
1
5
3
4
