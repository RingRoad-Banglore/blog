title: Uva 12897  Decoding Baby Boos
---


## Input

```text
Osantu has been tagged as the best Bangladeshi contestant of present time by many and now he is
mostly busy with the sweetest problem of his life  a baby boy. But Osantu often struggles to decode
the sound that the baby makes throughout the year and so he asks for your help. He has converted the
sound that the baby makes into a huge string. He thinks that sound made by the baby is often hard to
understand because he replaces one character with another character. So in his diary he has prepared
a list of replacement rules. Your job is to reverse these replacements and find the actual text that the
baby wanted to say although in many cases the rules are not reversible.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input file contains a positive integer T (T  6) which denotes how many test cases are
there in the input file. The description of each test case is given below:

First line of each test case contains a non-empty string S (containing only uppercase characters and
underscore). The length of this string can be up to 1000000. Next line contains a positive integer R
(R  10000), which denotes how many character replacement sequences follow. Each of the next R
lines contains two characters ai and bi (both ai and bi are uppercase letters and separated by a single
space) which denotes that while pronouncing the baby replaces character ai with character bi. As this
replacement list is prepared by Osantu (who has short term memory) so the list can contain the same
replacement rules twice, there can be cyclic rules like A is replaced with B, B is replaced with C
and C is replaced with A and also there can be contradicting rules like A is replaced with B and A
is replaced with C etc. So what you simply need to do is apply the reverse of those rules in the order
they appear in the input although it may not seem logical.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the string that is found by applying
all the R replacement rules.

Illustration of the 2nd sample input:
First replacement rule says the baby replaces A with B. So to reverse that rule all B s are replaced

with A. So the string becomes AAAACCY. The 2nd rule says B is replaced with C and so to reverse
this rule we replace all Cs with B and so the string becomes AAAABBY. The 3rd rule says that C is
replace with A and so to reverse that we now replace all As with C and so the string finally becomes
CCCCBBY.
