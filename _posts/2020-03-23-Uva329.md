329 PostScript Emulation
PostScript® is widely used as a page description language for laser printers. The basic unit of measure-
ment in PostScript is the point, and there are assumed to be exactly 72 points per inch. The default
coordinate system used at the beginning of a PostScript program is the familiar Cartesian system, with
the origin (the point with x and y coordinates both equal to zero) at the lower left comer of the page.

In this problem you are required to recognize a small part of the PostScript language. Specifically,
the commands listed below must be recognized. All commands will be given in lower-case letters. When
the word number appears in the command description, a floating point value, with an optional sign
and decimal point will be present in the input data. When two numbers appear in a command, the
first refers to the x coordinate, and the second to the y coordinate. For simplicity, each command will
appear on a line by itself, and a single blank will separate each component of the command. The end
of line character will immediately follow each command, and a line with a single asterisk in column one
will terminate the input.

You should preserve the order of operations.

number rotate
number represents the measure of an angle. This command rotates the coordinate system that
many degrees counterclockwise about the current origin. This does not affect any lines that have
already been drawn on the page.
Example: ‘90 rotate’ will rotate the axes 90 degrees counterclockwise, so the positive y axis now
points to the left, and the positive x axis points up.

number number translate
Moves the origin of the coordinate system to the position specified. The values are interpreted
relative to the current origin.
Example: ‘612 792 translate’ would move the origin of the coordinate system to the upper
right comer of the page. Now only points with negative x and y components will correspond to
points on the physical page (assuming an 8.5” by 11” page in the “portrait” orientation).

number number scale
This command applies the scaling factors given to the x and y coordinates. In effect, the actual
x and y sizes of objects are multiplied by the respective scale factors. Scaling will affect
everything on that directions no matter you rotate later.
Example: ‘3 2 scale’ would cause a line drawn from (0,0) to (72,72) to appear as if it was drawn
from the lower left corner of the page to a point three inches to the right of the left edge of the
paper and two inches up from the bottom edge of the paper, assuming the original coordinate
system was in effect just before the command.

number number moveto
The current point is moved to the coordinates specified.
Example: ‘72 144 moveto’ would move the current point to one inch from the left edge of the
paper, and two inches up from the bottom edge, assuming the original coordinate system was in
effect.

number number rmoveto
This command is like moveto, except the numbers specified give the coordinates of the new current
point relafive to the current position.
Example: ‘144 -36 rmoveto’ would move the current point set by the previous example two
inches further to the right and one-half inch lower on the page. Thus the coordinates of the
current point become (216,108). Notice that numbers can be negative!

number number lineto
Draws a line from the current position to the position specified by the numbers. The current
position becomes the position specified in the command.
Example: ‘216 144 lineto’ would draw a line from the current position to the point (216,144),
and leave the current point there. If we assume the current position from the previous example,
this would be a line from (216,108) to (216,144), or a half-inch vertical line.

number number rlineto
This is similar to ‘lineto’, but the coordinates given in the command are relative to the current
position. Again, the end of the line that is drawn becomes the new current position.
Example: ‘0 144 rlineto’ will draw a two inch horizontal line from the current position two
inches to the right. Using the current position left in the previous example, this draws a line from
(216,144) to (216,288), and leaves the current point at (216,288).

Input and Output
Your task is to read one of these small PostScript programs and to display a program that will produce
the same effect without using the ‘rotate’, ‘translate’ or ‘scale’ commands. That is, each ‘moveto’,
‘rmoveto’, ‘lineto’, and ‘rlineto’ command in the original (input) program should appear in your
output (most likely with modified numbers), but the ‘rotate’, ‘translate’ and ‘scale’ commands in
the input must not appear in the output. Assume the original coordinate system is in effect at the
beginning of execution. The numbers used with the commands in the program you produce must be
accurate to at least two fractional digits.

Note: The figure drawn by sample commands below is
illustrated on the right. Each of the lines is exactly one
inch long.
