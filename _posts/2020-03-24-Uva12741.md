title: Uva 12741  Weights of Toys
---


## Input

```

Bingbing has 3 toys: pikachu, wukong and barbie. She didnt know their exact weight, but she knows
the interval (in a mysterious weight unit), shown below.

Pikachu Wukong Barbie

Minimum possible weight 1 2 3

Maximum possible weight 3 4 5

Jiajia has an e-mobile, which can tell you the difference between the weights of both sides. The
emobile is huge, so you can put as many toys as possible on both sides.

Bingbing asks Jiajia for the mobile, but Jiajia wants to give Bingbing a challenge: she can use each
toy at most once on each side (so each toy can be used at most twice in total). Bingbing agreed. She
used the mobile twice, as shown below (number D means the left part is D unit heavier than the right
part):

Then, Bingbing knows the exact weights of each toy, as shown below:

Pikachu Wukong Barbie

Minimum possible weight 3 4 3

Maximum possible weight 3 4 3

One month later, Bingbing got n new toys and used the mobile m times (obeying the rules above).
Could you tell me the tightest bounds of each toys weight?
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers n and m
(3  n  200, 1  m  100). The second line contains 2n integers, the (2i 1)-th and the 2i-th integer
are the initial lower bound and upper bound of the i-th toy(1  b  c  20000). There are m lines
followed, each for a use of mobile. Each of these lines begins with 3 integers L, R, D (L,R  0), that
means there are L toys on the left, and R toys on the right. The total weight of the left side is D unit
larger than the right side (D < 0 means the weight of the left side is D unit smaller than the right

side). The next L integers are the toys on the left side, and the next R integers are the toys on the
right side. It is guaranteed that each toy can appear on each side at most once. The input terminates
with n = m = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print 2n integers, in the same format as the input. If there is no solution, print a
single -1.
