title: Uva 01649  Binomial coefficients
---


## Input

```text

Gunnar is quite an old and forgetful researcher. Right now he is writing a paper on security in social
networks and it actually involves some combinatorics. He wrote a program for calculating binomial
coefficients to help him check some of his calculations.

A binomial coefficient is a number (
n

k

)
=

n!

k!(n k)!
,

where n and k are non-negative integers.
Gunnar used his program to calculate

(
n
k

)
and got a number m as a result. Unfortunately, since he

is forgetful, he forgot the numbers n and k he used as input. These two numbers were a result of a long
calculation and they are written on one of many papers lying on his desk. Instead of trying to search
for the papers, he tried to reconstruct the numbers n, k from the output he got. Can you help him and
find all possible candidates?
```

## Output

```text
On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:

 one line with an integer m (2  m  1015): the output of Gunnars program.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Per test case:

 one line with an integer: the number of ways of expressing m as a binomial coefficient.

 one line with all pairs (n, k) that satisfy
(
n
k

)
= m. Order them in increasing order of n and, in

case of a tie, order them in increasing order of k. Format them as in the sample output.

```

## Sample Output
