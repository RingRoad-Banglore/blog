title: Uva 01042  Lots of Sunlight
---


```
The Apartment Construction Management (ACM) has several new high-rise apartment buildings in
suburban Shanghai. With the booming economy, ACM expects a considerable profit on apartment
leases. Because their apartments receive more direct sunlight, the company claims that these are nicer
than others in the area. No other buildings obstruct the sunlight path to apartments in ACMs tall
buildings.

ACM wants to verify this claim by telling potential residents exactly how much sunlight a given
apartment receives. To offer customers a representative sample of sunlight hours, the company wants
to advertise the sunlight hours for April 6, 2005. On that day in Shanghai, the sun rises at 5:37 am,
and sets at 6:17 pm.

As shown above, apartments are in a series of buildings aligned east to west. The last two digits
of the apartment number identify the building, starting with 01 for the east-most building. The other
digits encode the apartment floor, with 1 as the ground floor.

The sun rises in the east and travels at a constant radial speed across the sky, until setting in the
west. The only shadows are created by buildings (i.e. each building can cast a shadow on one or more
other buildings). An apartment is considered to receive sunlight when either its eastern or western
exterior wall is fully covered in sunlight or when the sun is directly overhead.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains a series of descriptions of apartment complexes. Each description starts with
a line containing a single integer n (1  n < 100) that is the number of apartment buildings in the
complex. The next line has two integers w, the width (in east-west direction), and h, each apartments
height in meters. Next is a list of integers m(1), d(1), m(2), d(2), . . ., d(n  1), m(n), where m(i) is
the number of apartments in apartment building i, and d(i) is the distance, in meters, between the
apartment building i and apartment building i+ 1.

The apartment complex description is followed by an integer list of apartments to query for sunlight
hours and is terminated by a zero. The input file is terminated by a line consisting of the integer zero.

```

## Output

```
For each apartment complex description, output its number in the sequence of descriptions. Then for
each query, output the corresponding sunlight hours, using the 24-hour time format. Truncate all times
down to the nearest second. If the query refers to an apartment that does not exist, indicate that the
apartment does not exist. Follow the format shown in the sample output.
