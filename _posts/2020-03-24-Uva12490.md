```
Given a positive integer n, denote by [n] the interval {x : 0  x  n} of real numbers. Consider a
function f : [n]  R. Values of f are provided on a subset S of [n], thereby partially specifying f .

The set S satisfies the following properties:

1. The points in S are all integers.

2. The extremes 0 and n of [n] are both in S.

The function f satisfies the following properties:

 The values of f in the integral points of [n] are integers.

 Between two consecutive points of S, the function is monotonic.

 For each non-integral point x in [n], the value of f(x) is given by the linear interpolation of f(x)
and f(x), ie, f(x) = (x x)f(x) + (x  x)f(x).

We still have the freedom of specifying the values of f in the integral points of [n]\S (note however
that S can contain all the integral points of [n]). We would like to use this flexibility to make

 n
0
f(x)dx =

y, i.e., the area under f(x) between the extremes 0 and n equal to y, a given value.
Your problem then is to decide whether this is possible or not.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains three integers, N , M and
Y , respectively the amplitude of the interval, the size of S and the value of y. Each of the following M
lines describes function f at a point of S, containing two integers X and F , representing f(X) = F .
The values of X are not necessarily in ascending order.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, determine whether there is a value assignment to f(x) for each integral point
x  [n]\S such that

 n
0
f(x)dx = y, i.e. the area under f(x) between the ends 0 and n is equal to

y. If not, your program should print a line containing only the character N. If the assignments are
possible, your program should print a line containing the character S, followed by values of f(x) for
the integral points x  [n]\S, in increasing order of the values of x. The initial character and following
values, if any, should be separated by a blank space. If more than one solution is possible, then print
the lexicographically smallest solution.
