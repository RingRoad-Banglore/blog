title: Uva 11787  Numeral Hieroglyphs
---


## Input

```text
Egyptians had a writing system based on hieroglyphs from around 3000 BC. Hieroglyphs are small
drawings representing words. Besides, Egyptians had a base 10 system of hieroglyphs for numerals.
That is, they had separate symbols for one unit (a bar), ten units (an inverted U), one hundred (a
spiral), one thousand (a paper plant), ten thousand (a finger), one hundred thousand (a tadpole) and
one million (a man kneeling).

These are the numeral hieroglyphs:

To make up number 276, for example, fifteen symbols were required: two hundred symbols, seven
ten symbols, and six unit symbols. Number 276 would appear as:

Number 4622 would be represented as:

As you can see, Egyptians wrote ordered symbols, according to its value, from left to right as well
as from right to left.

You have to convert numeral hieroglyphs into numbers. For that, we will use the following code:

So, we could represent 276 as SSUUUUUUUBBBBBB or BBBBBBUUUUUUUSS.
You cannot write more than nine times each character.
