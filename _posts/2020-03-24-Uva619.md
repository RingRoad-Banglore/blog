## Input

```text
A developer of crossword puzzles (and other similar word games) has decided to develop a mapping
between every possible word with from one to twenty characters and unique integers. The mapping is
very simple, with the ordering being done first by the length of the word, and then alphabetically. Part
of the list is shown below.

a 1
b 2
...
z 26
aa 27
ab 28
...
snowfall 157,118,051,752
...

Your job in this problem is to develop a program which can translate, bidirectionally, between the
unique word numbers and the corresponding words.
```

## Output

```text
Input to the program is a list of words and numbers, one per line starting in column one, followed by a
line containing a single asterisk in column one. A number will consist only of decimal digits (0 through
9) followed immediately by the end of line (that is, there will be no commas in input numbers). A word
will consist of between one and twenty lowercase alphabetic characters (a through z).

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output is to contain a single line for each word or number in the input data. This line is to contain
the word starting in column one, followed by an appropriate number of blanks, and the corresponding
word number starting in column 23. Word numbers that have more than three digits must be separated
by commas at thousands, millions, and so forth.
