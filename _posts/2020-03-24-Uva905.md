## Input

```

Figura 1: Panchitas signs

Panchita is established with a Tacos Shop in the desert of North
Mexico. To attract clients, she installed lots of signs like the one
represented in Figure 1 all over the desert. The signs are intended
to point in the direction of the shop; however, Panchitas magnetic
needle has a problem and only gives four directions: North, South,
East and West. Thus, the signs only point to the shop with a
certain approximation. In the desert, besides Panchitas shop
and the signs, there is nothing more.

Panchita is happy with her signs: people transversing the
desert usually make a deviation from their original route to follow
the signs up to the shop, and she makes money. Her life would be
perfect if there were no windstorms in the desert. The problem
is that the wind makes the signs rotate, as if they were weather-
cocks. After each storm, Panchita has to visit all the signs to fix
their direction.

Simulating Panchitas Set-Up
We may simulate a simplification of Panchitas environment using a grid-based representation as

the one in Figure 2. In this simulation, Panchitas shop is represented by a single dark position and
signs by two neighbour dark positions.

Figura 2: Panchitas grid world

Directions are defined as angles, taking the East direction as the 0o reference (e.g., North is 90o,
North-West is 135o).

A sign rotates around one of its dark positions: we call it the signs pivot position. This one
corresponds to the side of the sign with an arrow shape (in Figure 1, the left side). Thats why pivot
positions are represented in Figure 2 with triangles.

Thus, a pivot position remains fixed in the map when a sign changes direction. The position that
moves is called movable (see Figure 3).

Figura 3: Signs rotate around pivot positions

This representation obviously lacks lot of detail. Sign direction, for instance, can only be represented
in multiples of 45o. Therefore, we will assume that wind may only leave signs pointing in directions
which are multiples of 45o.

Given a partial map of the desert after a windstorm, simulate the result of changing the signs
directions to North, South, East or West, so that all them point approximately to Tacos Panchita.
Figure 4 illustrates a hypothetical scenario.

Figura 4: Signs after a windstorm

The intended result is represented in Figure 2: a new map with the signs directions changed by
moving movable positions.

To determine a corrected sign direction, you must first compute the direction  from Tacos Panchita
to the signs pivot position. , the new direction from the pivot to the respective movable position, will
be the closest multiple of 90o, i.e.,  will be the multiple of 90o such that   [  45o,  + 45o[ (note
the closed left interval).

Figure 5 illustrates this calculation: signs with pivots in area A must point to West, those with
pivots in area B must point to South, and so on.

Figura 5: New direction depends on the pivot position

The following assumptions will be taken:

 when correcting a signs direction, only the movable position may be changed

 after a windstorm, there are no two objects touching each other

 in the given partial map, every sign occupies exactly two positions; after correcting the signs
directions, this may not be true, as the movable part of the sign may be out of the map and will
not be represented

## Output

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive
test cases are separated by a single blank line.

The input file consists of a variable number of lines as follows: First line: x y w h

Next h lines: n p1 p2 . . . pn
where each pi is the x coordinate of a pivot position in the current line. Lines are presented in descending
order of their y coordinates. In each line, pivot coordinates are presented in ascending order.

Movable positions are not included in the input as they are not needed to solve the problem.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

Output should represent the map with the signs in the correct directions, and consist of a variable
number of lines as follows:

First line: x y w h

where x and y are the (always positive) coordinates of Tacos Panchitas position, and w and h are the
width and the height of the given map

Next h lines: m x1 x2 . . . xm

where each xj is the x coordinate of a movable position in the current line. Lines are presented in
descending order of their y coordinates. In each line, movable coordinates are presented in ascending
order.

Pivot positions are not included in the output as they are kept unchanged.
