```

In the world of telecommunications phone calls to different phone numbers have to be charged using
different rate or different billing plan. International Carrier of Phone Communications (ICPC) has an
antique billing table that determines which phone call has to be charged using which billing plan.

Each international phone number has 11 digits. The billing table has n lines. Each line specifies a
range of prefixes of phone numbers like 7919 - 921. This specification means that all phone numbers
starting from 7919, 7920, and 7921 match this line. A billing plan name is specified for each prefix.
To determine a billing plan for a call, the table is scanned from top to bottom and the first matching
line determines the billing plan. If no match is found, the phone number is invalid and no billing plan
is needed. A special billing plan named invalid (without quotes) is used as an alternative way to
define invalid phone numbers. Some billing plans are used for quite differently looking phone numbers
and their names may be specified on difffferent lines in different places of the table.

ICPCs billing table is old and contains many entries. Some of those entries may not be even used
anymore. It is very hard to figure out which phone numbers each billing plan is actually used for. The
ICPCs management has reached a decision to transform this billing table into a more legible format.
In this new format table consists of the lexicographically ordered list of simple prefixes (without the -
range feature of the old format) with a billing plan name for each prefix. No prefix of this new billing
table should be a prefix of any other prefix from the table. Thus, a simple dictionary lookup (binary
search, for example) will be sufficient to figure out a billing plan for a given phone number. Finding
all phone numbers for a given billing plan will also become quite a simple task. The number of lines in
the new billing table should be minimized. Billing plan named invalid should not be present in the
new billing table at all, since invalid phone numbers will be denoted by absence of the corresponding
prefix in the new billing table.

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive test cases are
separated by a single blank line.

The first line of the input contains a single integer number n (1  n  100)  the number of lines
in the old billing table. The following n lines describe the old billing table with one rule on a line. Each
rule contains four tokens separated by spaces  prefix A, minus sign (-), prefix B, and billing plan
name. Prefixes contain from 1 to 11 digits each, and the billing plan name contains from 1 to 20 lower
case letters.

Further, let us denote with |A| the number of digits in the prefix A. It is true that 1  |B|  |A|  11.
Moreover, last |B| digits of prefix A form a string that is lexicographically equal or precedes B.

Such pair of prefixes A and B matches all phone numbers with the first |A|  |B| digits matching
the first digits of A and with the following |B| digits being lexicographically between the last |B| digits
of A and B (inclusive).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

Write to the output file a single integer number k  the minimal number of lines that the new table
should contain to describe the given old billing table. Then write k lines with the lexicographically
ordered new billing table. Write two tokens separated by a space on each line  the prefix and the
billing plan name. Note, that the prefix in the new billing table shall contain at least one digit.

If all phone numbers are invalid (every phone number has no matching line or matches line with
billing plan invalid) then the output file should contain just number zero.
