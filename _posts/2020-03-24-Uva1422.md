An early adopter Mr. Kim bought one of the latest notebooks which has a speed-controlled processor.
The processor is able to operate at variable speed. But the higher the speed, the higher the power
consumption is. So, to execute a set of programs, adjusting the speed of the processor dynamically
results in energy-efficient schedules. We are concerned in a schedule to minimize the maximum speed
of the processor.

The processor shall execute a set of programs and each program Pi is given having a starting time
ri, a deadline di, and work wi. When the processor executes the programs, for each program Pi, the
work wi should be done on the processor within the interval [ri, di] to complete Pi. Also, the processor
does not have to execute a program in a contiguous interval, that is, it can interrupt the currently
running program and later resume it at the interrupted point. It is assumed that ri, di , and wi are
given positive integers. Recall that the processor can execute the programs at variable speed. If the
processor runs the program Pi with work wi at a constant speed s,then it takes

wi
s

time to complete
Pi. We also assume that the available speeds are positive integers, that is, the processor operates only
at integer points of speed. The speed is unbounded and the processor may operate at sufficiently large
speeds to complete all the programs. The processor should complete all the given programs and the
goal is to find a schedule minimizing the maximum of the speeds at which the processor operates.

For example, there are five programs Pi with the interval [ri, di] and work wi, i = 1, . . . , 5 , where
[r1, d1] = [1, 4], [r2, d2] = [3, 6], [r3, d3] = [4, 5], [r4, d4] = [4, 7], [r5, d5] = [5, 8] and w1 = 2, w2 = 3,
w3 = 2, w4 = 2, w5 = 1. Then the Figure 1 represents a schedule which minimizes the maximum speed
at which the processor operates. The maximum speed is 2 in this example.

## Input

```
The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases T (1  T  20) is given on the first line of
the input. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1  n  10, 000), the number of given
programs which the processor shall execute. In the next n lines of each test case, the i-th line contain
three integer numbers ri, di, and wi, representing the starting time, the deadline, and the work of the
program Pi, respectively, where 1  ri < di  20, 000, 1  wi  1, 000.

## Output

```
Print exactly one line for each test case. The line contains the maximum speed of a schedule minimizing
the maximum speed at which the processor operates to complete all the given programs.
