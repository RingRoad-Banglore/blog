A polyomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge
to edge.

 Wikipedia

Given a large polyomino and a small polyomino, your task is to determine whether you can compose
the large one with two copies of the small one. The polyominoes can be translated, but not flipped or
rotated. The two pieces should not overlap. The leftmost picture below is a correct way of composing
the large polyomino, but the right two pictures are not. In the middle picture, one of the pieces was
rotated. In the rightmost picture, both pieces are exactly identical, but theyre both rotated from the
original piece (shown in the lower-right part of the picture).
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n and m (1  m  n  10)
in a single line. The next n lines describe the large polyomino. Each of these lines contains exactly n
characters in *,.. A * indicates an existing square, and a . indicates an empty square. The next
m lines describe the small polyomino, in the same format. These characters are guaranteed to form
valid polyominoes (note that a polyomino contains at least one existing square). The input terminates
with n = m = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print 1 if the corresponding composing is possible, print 0 otherwise.
