title: Uva 13150  National Bomb Defusing Squad
---


## Input

```text
You are an IT and Statistics specialist in the National Bomb Defusing Squad. You have to use your
programming and statistical skills to find out locations of probable suicide bomb attacks. Sometimes
you also have to find the blast radius of bombs from the death toll. In this specific problem, you will
have to find the expected number of deaths due to a suicide bomb attack in a crowded place. For
simplicity, in this problem you can assume:

(1) Each person can be considered as a point in a 2-D Cartesian plane. So an (x, y) coordinate can
be used to denote the location of a person. Here x and y are always non-negative integers.

(2) All the persons in a scenario are equally likely to carry a bomb. But exactly one person will carry
the bomb.

(3) More than one person can be at the same coordinate.

(4) A suicide bomb has a blasting radius R. Everyone within the blasting radius dies. For example
a person at location (p, q) is carrying a bomb and there is another person at (m,n). When the
bomb explodes at (p, q) the person at (m,n) will die if his distance from (p, q) is not more than
R. The problem for you to solve is  for a given scenario you will have to calculate the death
toll for up to thousand values of R.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains maximum 7 test cases.

First line of each test case contains two integers N (0 < N  3000) and Q (0 < Q  1000). Here
N denotes the number of people in the scenario and Q denotes the number of queries to follow. Each
of the next N lines contains two integers (xi, yi) that denotes the Cartesian coordinate of one person
in the scenario. These integers are non negative and do not exceed 25000. Each of the next Q lines
contains a single integer Rj (0 < Rj < 40001). Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce Q lines of outputs. Each of this Q lines contains output for one query 
the expected number of deaths if the blast radius of the bomb is Rj . This value should be rounded to
two digits after the decimal point. Print a blank line after the output for each test case.
