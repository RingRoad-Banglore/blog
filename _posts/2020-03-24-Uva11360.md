title: Uva 11360  Having Fun with Matrices
---


```
We have a matrix of size N  N . Each value of the matrix occupies an integer from [0, 9]. A few
operations are going to be performed on this matrix. We would like to know how the matrix looks like
after these operations are performed sequentially.

There could be five different types of operations.

row a b

In this operation, row a is interchanged with row b.

col a b

In this operation, column a is interchanged with column b.

inc

In this operation, every cell value is increased by 1 (modulo 10). That is, if after adding 1, a cell
value becomes 10 we change it to 0.

dec

In this operation, every cell value is decreased by 1 (modulo 10). That is, if after subtracting 1, a
cell value becomes -1 we change it to 9.

transpose

In this operation, we simply transpose the matrix. Transposing a matrix, denoted by AT , means
turning all the rows of the given matrix into columns and vice-versa.

Example:

1 2 3 1 4 7

4 5 6 after transposing 2 5 8

7 8 9 3 6 9
```

## Input

```
The input file starts with an integer T (T < 50) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
starts with a positive integer N (N < 10) that represents the size of the matrix. The next N lines
contain N integers each. The value of each integer is in the range [0, 9]. Next there is a line with an
integer M (M < 50). Each of the next M lines contain an operation each. If the command is row a b
or col a b, then you can assume 1  a, b  N and a = b.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the case number on the first line. Then on the next N lines output the content
of the final matrix. Print a blank line after each case (even after the very last one).
