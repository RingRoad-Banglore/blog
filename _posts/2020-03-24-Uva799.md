title: Uva 00799  Safari Holiday
---


```

A safari holiday is organized for n people according to the following rules:

 During the safari, the participants are going out every day, in groups of exactly k persons, to
enjoy wildlife watching in deep savanna.

 The number of persons in a group is the same every day and cannot exceed a maximum value
kmax agreed by the safari organizers.

 For any given day, during the safari, each participant is member of a group in that day.

 Each day every person is in a totally new company, i.e. the remaining n  1 persons of his/her
group are different from those in the previous days.

 At the end of the safari everybody must have been in the company of everybody, i.e. for any two
participants A and B there is a day, during the safari, such that A and B are in the same group
that day.

For example, for 4 safari participants and for kmax = 3 there are 2 groups of 2 persons each every
day and the safari schedule can be as follows:

group 1 group 2

day 1: 1,2 3,4

day 2: 1,3 2,4

day 3: 1,4 2,3

Write a program that, for a given pair n, kmax (the number of safari participants and the maximum
size of the groups), computes the largest possible size of the safari groups (the largest possible value of
k such that k  kmax) and the corresponding number of days of the safari holiday.
```

## Input

```
The program reads sets of data from a text file. Each data set is on a separate line and has the format:
n kmax, where n and kmax are strictly positive integers, that can have large values.

```

## Output

```
For each data set the program prints to the standard output the corresponding size of the safari groups
and the number of days of the safari holiday, as illustrated in the sample below. If the problem has no
solution the program prints the message No solution. Each result is on a separate line.

```

## Sample Input
