title: Uva 10246  Asterix and Obelix
---


## Input

```text
After winning a gruesome battle against the Romans in a far-
away land, Asterix and his dearest friend Obelix are now return-
ing home. However Obelix is not with Asterix now. He has left
Asterix in order to deliver menhir to one of his international buy-
ers (as you probably know, recently he has extended his trade to
international markets). But he has promised to join Asterix on
his way home and Asterix has promised to host a feast for Obelix
(you know how fat he is!) in the city they meet. Obelix may meet
Asterix in any city on his way home including the starting and
the destination city.

Now Asterix is sitting with a map and trying to figure out
the cheapest route home. The map shows the cities and the cost
(in sestertii) of going from one city to another if there is a road
connecting them directly. For each city in the map Asterix has
also calculated the cost (in sestertii) of hosting a feast for Obelix
in that city. There will be only one feast and for safety Asterix has decided to set aside enough sestertii
to host a feast in the costliest city on the route.

Since Asterix does not have a computer, he seeks your help to find out the cheapest route home.
```

## Output

```text
The input may contain multiple test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers C( 80), R ( 1000) and Q ( 6320) where
C indicates the number of cities (cities are numbered using distinct integers ranging from 1 to C), R
represents the number of roads and Q is the number of queries.

The next line contains C integers where the i-th integer fi is the cost (in sestertii) of hosting a feast
in city i.

Each of the next R lines contains three integers: c1, c2 (= c1) and d indicating that the cost of going
from city c1 to c2 (or from c2 to c1) is d sestertii.

Each of the next Q lines contains two integers c1 and c2 (c1 = c2) asking for the cost (in sestertii)
of the cheapest route from city c1 to city c2.

The input will terminate with three zeros form C, S and Q.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input first output the test case number (starting from 1) as shown in the
sample output. Then for each query in the input print a line giving the minimum cost (in sestertii) of
going from the first to the second city in the query. If there exists no path between them just print -1.

Print a blank line between two consecutive test cases.

```
