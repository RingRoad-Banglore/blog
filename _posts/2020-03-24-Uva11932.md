title: Uva 11932  Net Profit
---


```
Thomas has just designed a new game called
Net Profit. The game is played by two players
on a net of business ventures, each of which
offers a certain amount of profit (or loss) in dol-
lars. The term net refers to the fact that ven-
tures are connected to each other by randomly
generated links (chosen in such a way that all
the ventures are connected).

The first player may pick any venture to
start, and he scores the associated profit or loss.
This venture is now referred to as exhausted.
Afterward, the players take turns exhausting
ventures and collecting profits, following two
simple rules:

1. An exhausted venture may not be selected again (by either player)

2. Only ventures connected to an already exhausted venture are eligible for exhaustion

The game ends once all the ventures are exhausted, and the winner is the player with the greatest
profit (or smallest loss). With a given net of ventures and associated profits, Thomas would like to
know the final outcome of the game assuming optimal play from both players.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with an integer N (1  N  16), representing
the number of ventures in the net. This is followed by a line containing N integers p1, p2, . . . , pN ; where
pk is the profit associated with venture k (|pk|  1000).

Next is a line containing a non-negative integer M , followed by M lines, each describing a link in
the net. Each link description consists of two integers a and b (1  a, b  N , a = b), which means
that ventures a and b are linked.

You may assume that the described net connects all the ventures in one component, and that a
given link is described at most once (so if link a b is given, link b a will not be).

The input is terminated by a line containing 0 which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line with the final result and score of the game assuming optimal play by
both players (see the sample output for details).
