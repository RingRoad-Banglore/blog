title: Uva 11040  Add bricks in the wall
---


## Input

```text
This in not another brick in the wall, its just a matter of adding numbers. Suppose you have a wall
with the shape of a triangle, like the one shown below. The wall has 9 rows and row i has exactly i
bricks, considering that top row is the first one and bottom row is the ninth. Some bricks are labeled
with a number and other ones are blank. Notice that labeled bricks appear only on odd rows and they
occupy odd positions within the row. The problem you must solve is finding a suitable number for
each blank brick taking into account one simple rule: the number of a brick is obtained by adding the
numbers of the two bricks below it. Obviously, this rule does not apply to the ninth row. Numbers are
supposed to be integers.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer N , indicating the number of test cases. This line is
followed by the lines corresponding to the test cases. Each test case is described in five lines. These
five lines correspond to odd rows of the wall, from top to bottom, as described above. Line i contains
the numbers corresponding to odd bricks on row i of the wall (that is, non blank bricks), enumerated
from left to right and separated with a single space. It is supposed that each test case is correct, that
is, there exists a solution to the problem that the case describes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output should consist of nine lines describing the numbers of all bricks of the wall.
So, line i should contain the numbers corresponding to the i bricks on row i of the wall, enumerated
from left to right and separated by a single space.

Note: Here we have an example with two test cases. The first one corresponds to the wall depicted
above.
