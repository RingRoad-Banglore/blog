11686 Pick up sticks
Pick up sticks is a fascinating game. A
collection of coloured sticks are dumped
in a tangled heap on the table. Players
take turns trying to pick up a single stick
at a time without moving any of the other
sticks. It is very difficult to pick up a stick
if there is another stick lying on top of it.
The players therefore try to pick up the
sticks in an order such that they never
have to pick up a stick from underneath
another stick.

## Input
The input consists of several test cases.
The first line of each test case contains
two integers n and m each at least one
and no greater than one million. The in-
teger n is the number of sticks, and m is the number of lines that follow. The sticks are numbered
from 1 to n. Each of the following lines contains a pair of integers a, b, indicating that there is a point
where stick a lies on top of stick b. The last line of input is ‘0 0’. These zeros are not values of n and
m, and should not be processed as such.

## Output
For each test case, output n lines of integers, listing the sticks in the order in which they could be
picked up without ever picking up a stick with another stick on top of it. If there are multiple such
correct orders, any one will do. If there is no such correct order, output a single line containing the
word ‘IMPOSSIBLE’.

## Sample Input
<p>3 2</p><p>1 2</p><p>2 3</p><p>0 0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p>
