title: Uva 11361  Investigating DivSum Property
---


```
An integer is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. For example, 3702 is divisible
by 3 and 12(3+7+0+2) is also divisible by 3. This property also holds for the integer 9.

In this problem, we will investigate this property for other integers.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 100) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case is a
line containing 3 positive integers A, B and K. 1  A  B < 231 and 0 < K < 10000.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the number of integers in the range [A,B] which is divisible by K and the sum
of its digits is also divisible by K.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
1 20 1
1 20 2
1 1000 4

```

## Sample Output

```
20
5
64
```
