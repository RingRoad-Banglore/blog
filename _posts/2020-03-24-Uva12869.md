title: Uva 12869  Zeroes
---


## Input

```
Factorial n is written as n! and n! = 123 . . .(n1)n. For example 2! = 12 = 2, 3! = 123 = 6,
5! = 120, 10! = 3, 628, 800, etc. The function fzero(n) denotes the number of trailing zeroes in n! in
decimal number system. For example fzero(2) = 0, fzero(5) = 1, fzero(10) = 2. Given the domain
of the input parameter v of fzero(v) function, you will have to find out how many different values of
fzero() are there within this range.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 50001 lines of inputs. Each line contains two positive integers low and
high (0 < low  high  9  1018). Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer D, which denotes how
many different values the function fzero(v) can have if (low  v  high).

Note:
Illustration for Sample input 1: as 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5,040,

8! = 40,320, 9! = 362,880, 10! = 3,628,800, so fzero(1) = 0, fzero(2) = 0, fzero(3) = 0, fzero(4) = 0,
fzero(5) = 1, fzero(6) = 1, fzero(7) = 1, fzero(8) = 1, fzero(9) = 1 and fzero(10) = 2. So in this
range (1 to 10) there are three different values of fzero(v): 0, 1 and 2.

```

## Sample Output

```
1 10
1 3
0 0

```
