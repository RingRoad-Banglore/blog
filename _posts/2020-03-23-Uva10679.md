10679 I Love Strings!!!
Hmmmmmm.......... strings again :) Then it must be an easy task for you. Well …you are given with
a string S of length not more than 100,000 (only ‘a’-‘z’ and ‘A’-‘Z’). Then follows q (q < 1000) queries
where each query contains a string T of maximum length 1,000 (also contains only ‘a’-‘z’ and ‘A’-‘Z’).
You have to determine whether or not T is a sub-string of S.

## Input
First line contains an integer k (k < 10) telling the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins
with S. It is followed by q. After this line there are q lines each of which has a string T as defined
before.

## Output
For each query print ‘y’ if it is a sub-string of S or ‘n’ otherwise followed by a new line. See the sample
output below.

## Sample Input
<p>2</p><p>abcdefghABCDEFGH</p><p>2</p><p>abc</p><p>abAB</p><p>xyz</p><p>1</p><p>xyz</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>y</p><p>n</p><p>y</p>
