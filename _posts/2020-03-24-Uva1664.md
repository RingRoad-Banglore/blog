title: Uva 01664  Conquer a New Region
---


## Input

```text

The wheel of the history rolling forward, our king conquered a new region in a distant continent.
There are N towns (numbered from 1 to N) in this region connected by several roads. Its confirmed

that there is exact one route between any two towns. Traffic is important while controlled colonies are
far away from the local country. We define the capacity C(i, j) of a road indicating it is allowed to
transport at most C(i, j) goods between town i and town j if there is a road between them. And for a
route between i and j, we define a value S(i, j) indicating the maximum traffic capacity between i and
j which is equal to the minimum capacity of the roads on the route.

Our king wants to select a center town to restore his war-resources in which the total traffic capacities
from the center to the other N1 towns is maximized. Now, you, the best programmer in the kingdom,
should help our king to select this center.
```

## Output

```text
There are multiple test cases.
The first line of each case contains an integer N . (1  N  200, 000)
The next N  1 lines each contains three integers a, b, c indicating there is a road between town a

and town b whose capacity is c. (1  a, b  N , 1  c  100, 000)

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output an integer indicating the total traffic capacity of the chosen center town.
