## Input

```
At the largest conference on coding and cryptography the following theorem needed a proof or a
counterexample: Suppose you are given a set of words of equal length; each word consisting of 0s, 1s
and/or *s. Furthermore suppose the pattern of *s is different for all words in the set. By this we
mean: if you replace all 0s and 1s by say $ you obtain different words.

The claim is: if you replace the *s by 0s and 1s in all possible ways, then you obtain a set that
is at least as big as the set you started with.

Example:
{ 10*, *0*, *00 } produces { 100, 101, 000, 001 }
{ 100, 101, 10* } produces { 100, 101 }

Notice that the set in the latter example does not satisfy the condidtion mentioned above, so it does
not provide a counterexample.

You program has to check for a number of cases:

1. Whether the pattern of *s is different for all words in the set and:

2. Compute the number of words obtained by replacing the *s by 0s and 1s.

The words will not be longer than 15 symbols.
```

## Output

```
The input is a text-file that presents a sequence of sets. Each set is described as follows. The first line
gives two integers: the length of the words and the number of the words. Then follow the words, each
on a separate line. The end of the sequence of sets is indicated by a set with wordlength 0 and number
of words equal to 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output is a textfile that contains one line for each set. if the pattern of *s is different for all the
words in this set this line should contain YES (in uppercase), followed by a space and the number of
obtained words, otherwise it should contain NO (uppercase) only.

```

## Sample Output

```
3 3
10*
*0*
*00
4 3
1100
1101
110*
0 0
