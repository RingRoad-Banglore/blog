## Input

```text

A motorway is passing through a tunnel, d meters long, as illustrated in figure 1. The rate of the traffic
directed eastwards is of one vehicle every t1 seconds, and the rate of the traffic directed westwards is of
one vehicle every t2 seconds. The vehicles going east have a constant speed of v1 m/s, while the vehicles
going west have a constant speed of v2 m/s.

Figure 1: The motorway

Write a program that computes the number of vehicle rendezvous that occur inside the tunnel
during the closed time interval [ti, tf ] that is measured in seconds. It is known that:

 A rendezvous point is considered inside the tunnel if it is in between the entrances of the tunnel.
Rendezvous at the tunnel entrances are outside the tunnel, as shown in figure 1.

 At time 0 there is a vehicle advancing eastwards that is d1 meters away from the entrance of the
tunnel, and there is another vehicle advancing westwards that is d2 meters away from the entrance
of the tunnel. These vehicles are part of the already existing traffic on the motorway.

 Input and output data are integers. The magnitude range of the problem parameters is as follows:
0  d, d1, d2  100000, 0 < t1, t2  10000, 10000  ti, tf  10000.
```

## Output

```text
The program reads sets of data from a text file. Each data set is on a separate line and has the format:
d d1 d2 v1 v2 t1 t2 ti tf . The input data are correct.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each data set the program writes to the standard output the number of rendezvous. Each result is
on a separate line. An example of program input/output for six data sets is shown in the sample below.

```
