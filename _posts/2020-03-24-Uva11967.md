Everybody knows how to play tic-tac-toe. If accidentally you do not know the rules of this game, you
can always consult Wikipedia.

In this problem we will use a slightly different version of tic-tac-toe. First, the game board is not
limited to 3 3 cells, but considered infinite. Also in order to win a player must get not 3 but at least
k noughts or crosses in a line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).

In modified tic-tac-to version it is not so easy to determine a winner. So in this problem you will be
given a list of turns performed by the players during the game and you need to determine the winner.
```

## Input

```
There is a number of tests T (T  100) on the first line. Each test case is described by the two numbers
n k (n  105, k  5), where n stands for number of turns for both players and k for winning line size.
Next line contains n pairs of signed 32-bit integers x y  coordinates of each players turn. All turns
have been performed sequentially by both players and crosses have always started a game.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output a single line Case T: S. Where T is the test case number (starting from
1) and S is equal to crosses or noughts if one of them has a winning line. If nobody yet has won a
game output none and if both players have winning lines output error for S.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
3 2
0 0 1 1 1 0
4 2
0 0 -1 0 1 1 -1 1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: crosses
Case 2: error
```
