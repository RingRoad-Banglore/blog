## Input

```text
Do you know anyone, whose birthday is on 29- th February? I dont. But I was thinking about such a
person and it made me sad. A person like that would be so unlucky, dont you think? Unlike others,
they will have a birthday every four years. And sometimes, not even in four years. Because we know
29- th February only occurs in leap years. And a year will be a leap year if and only if the following
function  returns  true.

1 bool  isLeapYear(int  year)
2 {
3 if (year %  400  ==  0)  return  true;
4 else  if(year  %  100  ==  0)  return  false;
5 else  if(year  %  4  ==  0)  return  true;
6 else  return  false;
7 }

The above function means, a year that is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 are leap years but
with the exception that years that are divisible by 400 are also leap years (although that is also divisible 
 by  100).

But its just so unfair. Take for instance a person who is born on 29- th February, 1888. He will
have another birthday on 29- th February, 1892. Then in 1896. And then in 1900 he wont have one.
Because its a year which is not divisible by 400 but is divisible by 100. What a pity! He will have to
wait 8 years for  his  next  birthday  in  1904.

So if you are given the birthday of a person and a query year  QY  , you cant easily say how many
birthdays he had till 31-st December of the year  QY  . There are complex mathematics involved. And it
can make you very sad. So these are very dangerous problems for a human to solve. Honestly speaking,
I myself got a bit sad and depressed while writing this problem thinking about those very unfortunate
persons. I dont want to think of them anymore, so please solve the problem for me. Given a year  QY  ,
I was wondering how many birthdays a person has celebrated by the end of the year  QY  .  You  will  also 
 be  given  the  persons  birthday.

For example, given a person whose birthday is on 29- th February, 1888, how many birthdays does
he celebrate if  QY = 1910 ? The answer is  4 (1892, 1896, 1904 and 1908). Similarly a person having
birthday on 31-st December, 1987 celebrated  3 birthdays if QY = 1990 . Note, a person just being born,
cant  celebrate  his  birthday.  Thats  why  we  didnt  count  the  birth  year  as  a  birthday.

## Output

```text
First line will contain an integer,  T (T  100) , the number of test cases. Each case will contain four
integers per line:  D ,  M (1  M  12) ,  Y  (1850  Y  2016) and  QY (Y  QY  3000) . Together,
 D ,  M and  Y will form a persons birthday where  D denotes day ( D will always be a valid day based
on  M and  Y  ),  M denotes month and  Y  denotes year. You can assume, that it will always be a valid
date. QY (as  described  above),   means  the  year  upto  which  you  need  to  calculate  (inclusive).

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output one line per case: Case C: X, where  C is the case number and  X is the answer.

See the sample  for  clarification.
