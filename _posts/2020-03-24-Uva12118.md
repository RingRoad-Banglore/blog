title: Uva 12118  Inspectors Dilemma
---


## Input

```text
In a country, there are a number of cities. Each pair of city is connected by a highway, bi-directional of
course. A road-inspectors task is to travel through the highways (in either direction) and to check if
everything is in order. Now, a road-inspector has a list of highways he must inspect. However, it might
not be possible for him to travel through all the highways on his list without using other highways. He
needs a constant amount of time to traverse any single highway. As you can understand, the inspector
is a busy fellow does not want to waste his precious time. He needs to know the minimum possible time
to complete his task. He has the liberty to start from and end with any city he likes. Please help him
out.
```

## Output

```text
The input file has several test cases. First line of each case has three integers: V (1  V  1000), the
number of cities, E (0  E  V  (V  1)/2), the number of highways the inspector needs to check and
T (1  T  10), time needed to pass a single highway. Each of the next E lines contains two integers
a and b (1  a, b  V , a = b) meaning the inspector has to check the highway between cities a and b.
The input is terminated by a case with V = E = T = 0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the serial of output followed by the minimum possible time the inspector needs
to inspect all the highways on his list. Look at the output for sample input for details.
