be positioned to do a killer shot.

```
The input consists of several tests cases. A test case is presented on three lines, each one with a pair
of integers Xi, Yi (3000  Xi, Yi  3000), indicating the points in the plane where the enemies are
placed. It is granted that all given points are different.

```

## Sample Input
