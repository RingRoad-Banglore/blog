title: Uva 13226  Just Pentagon Perimeter
---


```
Given a set of points in the plane, find the convex pentagon with largest perimeter such that each vertex
of the pentagon is a unique point in the point set! Note that convex means no line segment between
two points on the boundary of the pentagon ever goes outside the pentagon.
```

## Input

```
A number of test cases ( 100), one per line, each with N (1  N  8500), followed by N points with
(x, y) integer.

Each integer fit in 32 bits signed. Note there are no duplicate points.

```

## Output

```
Output the perimeter rounded to 2 decimal places on one line for each test case. If no such pentagon
exists, print -1.

```

## Sample Input

```
1
0 0
6
0 0
0 2
1 2
1 3
2 0
2 2
