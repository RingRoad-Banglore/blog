12930 Bigger or Smaller
Given two floating-point numbers, determine whether the first one is bigger, smaller or the same as the
second one. Each floating point number is formatted as

[integer part].[fraction part]

For simplicity, both of the integer part and fraction part of the given floating point numbers will be
non-empty, and the integer part will not have leading zeros. However, fraction part can have trailing
zeros, so 0.0 is the same as 0.000.

## Input
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each test case contains a single line with two floating-point numbers
formatted as above. Each number is a string with no more than 100 characters.

## Output
For each test case, print the case number, and one of ‘Bigger’, ‘Smaller’ and ‘Same’.

## Sample Input
<p>1.0 2.0</p><p>0.00001 0.00000</p><p>0.0 0.000</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>Case 1: Smaller</p><p>Case 2: Bigger</p><p>Case 3: Same</p>
