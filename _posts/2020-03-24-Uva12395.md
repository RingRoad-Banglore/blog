title: Uva 12395  Regular Convex Polygon
---


```
A regular convex polygon is a polygon where each side has the same length, and all interior angles are
equal and less than 180 degrees. A square, for example, is a regular convex polygon. You are given
three points which are vertices of a regular convex polygon R; can you determine the minimum number
of vertices that R must have?
```

## Input

```
Each test case consists of three lines. Line i consists of two floating point values xi and yi (104 
x1, y1  104) where (xi, yi) are the coordinates of a vertex of R. The coordinates are given with a
precision of 106, i.e., they differ from the exact coordinates by at most 106. You may assume that
for each test case the Euclidean distance between any two given points is at least 1, and R has at most
1000 vertices. The input will finish with a line containing the word END.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print one line with the minimum number of vertices that R must have.
