title: Uva 12813  Mocking the Precision

```

During recent RPC training competitions, the chief judge was very concerned about the rounding
problems in some of the test cases. Since they are a common source of mistakes among the contestants,
he decided that from this moment on, his problems must have their answers written in the form of
equivalent proper fractions. As he has written more than 2000 exercises this year, it would be quite
tasking for him to change every single test case by hand, so he needs a very smart team to be able to
take all the answers and convert them into their equivalent mixed number.

Note: We encourage you to learn more about the subject, which will serve you well
in future programming contests and software development in general. See, for example,

```

## Input

```
There can be many test cases, each one described in a single line with a number D, which needs to be
converted. If D is a periodic number, its period is written in parentheses.

The number of digits after the decimal point and before the parentheses, and the number of digits
inside the parentheses will be at most 8.

106  D  106

```

## Output

```
For each input case, you are to write the corresponding mixed number in a single line, such that the
integer part is separated from the fraction by a space. The fraction must be properit should be in
the form p/q, where p and q are coprimes and p < q.
