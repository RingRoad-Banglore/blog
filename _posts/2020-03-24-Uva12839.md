title: Uva 12839  Judge in Queue
---


## Input

```

The great judge Upo again lost his passport. So he went to the passport office to get a new one. As
a lot of people come in passport office, there are always several long queues. People wait in the queue
until they get the job done. While waiting in the queue for some time, Upo came up with the following
problem! How about writing a program to determine the best way to arrange N peoples into M queues,
so that the waiting time of a person who waits longest is minimized?

You are given an array W with N elements, denoting the time N people already waited standing
in the queue. An array T with M integers, where T [i] is the time needed to serve a single person in
i-th queue. As Upo is standing in the queue right now. He wants you to right the program for him, to
calculate the minimum waiting time for a person who waits the longest.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with T , the number of test cases to follow. First line of each test case is two integers N
and M . In the next line will contain N space separated integer representing the time N people already
waited. Next line contains M space separated integer where i-th integer is the serving time of a single
person in i-th queue.

1  T  10, 1  N  105, 1  M  104, 1  W [i]  109, 1  T [i]  109

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output the test case number starts from 1 and a number denoting the minimum
waiting time for a person who waits the longest.
