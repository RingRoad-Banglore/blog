title: Uva 12309  A Strange Opera House II
---


```
Yesterday evening, I have dreamed of a strange opera house which is in the form of a simple polygon.
I was standing on the stage at (x, y) singing Thats All I Ask of You with my girlfriend  thats our
favorite song.

The walls can reflect our voice at most k times. The following 4 figures show how our voice is
reflected.

I wonder how much area in opera house could hear our song, either directly or indirectly. Can you
tell me?
```

## Input

```
The input consists of at most 10 test cases. Each case contains four integers n, k, x and y (3  n  50,
0  k  5), the number of vertices of the opera house, the maximal number of reflections of our voice,
and the location of the stage. The stage will never be on a wall. The following n lines each contain
two integers xi and yi, the coordinates of the vertices. The vertices are arranged either clockwise or
counterclockwise. The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed. All the
coordinates are integers with absolute values not greater than 1000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the total area of the places that could hear our song, to two decimal places.
