title: Uva 12324  Philip J Fry Problem
---


```
Its been a few months since Bender solved his famous bending problem. A special request has arrived
to Planet Express Inc., the interplanetary courier company where Bender works. Professor Farnsworth
(founder, CEO, and chairman of the board) immediately prepared the mission and summoned his crew:
Philip J. Fry, Turanga Leela, and Bender. To succeed in the mission, the crew has to make n trips 1,
2, . . ., n, in the exact order established by Professor Farnsworth. He has also provided the crew with
a notebook that specifies how many minutes each trip in the spaceship will take.

Nibbler, from Futurama.
The Curiosity Company and

20thCentury Fox.

Nibbler, Leelas stupid pet, is also a member of the crew and a
critical element to succeed in the mission. Nibblers feces, which
it expels every now and then, consist of spheres of dark matter
that can be used to increase the speed of the spaceship. In fact,
a sphere used during a trip halves its duration. Benders role
in the mission is to pick up the heavy spheres and put them in
the reactor of the spaceship. However, he will never put two
spheres during the same trip: the accumulation of dark matter is
extremely dangerous and may destroy the spaceship.

In each trip of the mission, Nibbler expels a certain number
of dark matter spheres that can be used to decrease the duration
of any of the upcoming trips. In other words, a sphere of dark
matter produced during the trip i can be used to duplicate the
speed of the spaceship in one of the trips j , with i < j  n.

Fry is responsible for planning how to use the spheres to re-
duce the total travel time. Your task is to help Fry in determining
what is the minimum duration of the mission if he uses Nibblers
spheres cleverly.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains an integer n indicating the
number of trips (1  n  100). Then, n lines follow describing each of the trips 1, 2, , n: each line
contains two integers ti and bi separated by blanks, where ti (2  ti  1000) indicates the duration
in minutes specified by Professor Farnsworth for the trip i (ti is always even) and bi (0  bi  n)
indicates the number of dark matter spheres that Nibbler will expel during the trip i. The last test
case is followed by a line containing a single 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line with an integer number indicating the minimum time required to complete
the mission.
