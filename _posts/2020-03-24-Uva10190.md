title: Uva 10190  Divide, But Not Quite Conquer!
---


## Input

```text
Your goal in this problem is to divide a certain integer n by another integer m until n = 1, obtaining
a sequence of numbers. Lets call a[i] each number of this sequence, and lets say it has k numbers (i.e.
you must do k 1 succesive divisions to reach n = 1). You can only have this sequence if the following
restrictions are met:

 a[1] = n, a[i] = a[i 1]m, for all 1 < i  k

 a[i] is divisible by m (that is, a[i] mod m = 0) for all 1  i < k

 a[1] > a[2] > a[3] > . . . > a[k]

For instance, if n = 125 and m = 5, you have 125, 25, 5 and 1 (you did 3 divisions: 125/5, 25/5 and
5/5). So, k = 4, a[1] = 125, a[2] = 25, a[3] = 5 and a[4] = 1.

If n = 30 and m = 3, you have 30, 10, 3 and 1. But a[2] = 10, and 10 mod 3 = 1, so there is no
sequence because it violates restriction 2. When the sequence doesnt exist we think its not fun and,
thus, very boring!
```

## Output

```text
The input will consist on an arbitrary number of lines. Each line will consist of two non-negative
integers n, m which are both less than 2000000000. You must read until you reach the end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each pair n, m you must print the correspondent sequence a (as defined above) in a single line, with
each adjacent numbers of the sequence separated by a single space. In the case the sequence doesnt
exist because it violates some restriction, just print the phrase Boring! in a single line (without the
quotes).

```

## Sample Output

```text
125 5
30 3
80 2
81 3

```
