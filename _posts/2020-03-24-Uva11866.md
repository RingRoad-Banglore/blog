title: Uva 11866  Triangle
---


## Input

```text
How many triangles are there when they have integer length sides and all the sides are between X and
Y inclusive. Two triangles differs if their side length set s are different. For example {2,3,3}, {2,3,4}
and {2,2,3} are all different triangles. But {5,6,7} and {6,5,7} are not different. In a triangle the sum
of smaller two sides are strictly greater than the largest side.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T (1  T  20000), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of
two integer X and Y (1  X  Y  1000000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the number of possible triangles whose side lengths are between X and Y
inclusive.

```

## Sample Output

```text
5
1 10
5 10
5 15
10 20
100 400

```
