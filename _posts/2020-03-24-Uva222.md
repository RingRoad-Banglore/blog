## Input

```

An American travel agency is sometimes asked to estimate the minimum cost of traveling from one
city to another by automobile. The travel agency maintains lists of many of the gasoline stations along
the popular routes. The list contains the location and the current price per gallon of gasoline for each
station on the list.

In order to simplify the process of estimating this cost, the agency uses the following rules of thumb
about the behavior of automobile drivers.

 A driver never stops at a gasoline station when the gasoline tank contains more than half of its
capacity unless the car cannot get to the following station (if there is one) or the destination with
the amount of gasoline in the tank.

 A driver always fills the gasoline tank completely at every gasoline station stop.

 When stopped at a gasoline station, a driver will spend $2.00 on snacks and goodies for the trip.

 A driver needs no more gasoline than necessary to reach a gasoline station or the city limits of
the destination. There is no need for a safety margin.

 A driver always begins with a full tank of gasoline.

 The amount paid at each stop is rounded to the nearest cent (where 100 cents make a dollar).

You must write a program that estimates the minimum amount of money that a driver will pay for
gasoline and snacks to make the trip.

## Output

```
Program input will consist of several data sets corresponding to different trips. Each data set consists
of several lines of information. The first 2 lines give information about the origin and destination. The
remaining lines of the data set represent the gasoline stations along the route, with one line per gasoline
station. The following shows the exact format and meaning of the input data for a single data set.

Line 1: One real number  the distance from the origin to the destination

Line 2: Three real numbers followed by an integer

 The first real number is the gallon capacity of the automobiles fuel tank.

 The second is the miles per gallon that the automobile can travel.

 The third is the cost in dollars of filling the automobiles tank in the origination city.

 The integer (less than 51) is the number of gasoline stations along the route.

Each remaining line: Two real numbers

 The first is the distance in miles from the origination city to the gasoline station.

 The second is the price (in cents) per gallon of gasoline sold at that station.

All data for a single data set are positive. Gasoline stations along a route are arranged in nonde-
scending order of distance from the origin. No gasoline station along the route is further from the origin
than the distance from the origin to the destination. There are always enough stations appropriately
placed along the each route for any car to be able to get from the origin to the destination.

The end of data is indicated by a line containing a single negative number.

## Sample Input

```
For each input data set, your program must print the data set number and a message indicating the
minimum total cost of the gasoline and snacks rounded to the nearest cent. That total cost must include
the initial cost of filling the tank at the origin. Sample input data for 2 separate data sets and the
corresponding correct output follows.
