title: Uva 10502  Counting rectangles
---


```
In some tests there appears the problem of finding the number of rectangles (or circles, or triangles, ...)
of different sizes in a figure. We consider the problem of counting rectangles (including squares) in a
rectangular board.

Given a rectangular board with n rows and m columns, with valid possitions marked with 1 and
non valid possitions marked with 0, we want to count the number of rectangles (including squares) in
the board formed by squares marked with 1.
```

## Input

```
The input will consist of a series of problems, with each problem in a serie of lines. In the first and
second lines the rows (n) and columns (m) of the board are indicated, in the next n lines the board in
represented, with a row of the board in each line, and m 0 or 1 (without spaces) in each line. When
the input of a problem finishes the next problem begins in the next line. The input finishes when 0
appears as the dimension of the board. Both dimensions of the board are less than or equal to 100.

```

## Output

```
The solution of each problem appears in a line, without separation between lines. For example, in the
board

11
01

the rectangles are:

1- -1 -- 11 -1
-- -- -1 -- -1

```

## Sample Input
