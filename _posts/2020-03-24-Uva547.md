## Input

```text
An integer a is a positive factor of an integer b if a is greater than zero and there exist some integer n
such that a n = b.

Consider a sequence of integer x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn. This sequence is a Decimal-Digit Factor Sequence
(DDF) if each number in the sequence is a positive integer where x1 > 1 and for all positive integers
i > 1, xi+1 is the sum of the digits of all positive factors of xi.

The following is a DDF:

17, 9, 13, 5, 6, ...
positive factor of 17 = 1, 17
1 + (1 + 7) = 9
positive factor of 9 = 1, 3, 9
1 + 3 + 9 = 13
positive factor of 13 = 1, 13
1 + (1 + 3) = 5
positive factor of 5 = 1, 5
1 + 5 = 6

It is known that any DDF beginning whit a number greater than or equal to 1000 repeats no number
greater than or equal to 1000 and contains a number less than 1000. In addition, every DDF beginning
whit a number less than 1000 contains no number greater than 999. Thus, every DDF must eventually
repeat number less than 1000. It has also been show that every DDF eventually repeats a single number.
That is, for each DDF, there exists a number xn, called the last term, such that for all j > n, xj = xn.

Write a program that will find the longest DDF.
```

## Output

```text
You have to read the input file. Each line will have two numbers m, n which define the range were you
have to find the longest DDF. In non case m and n will be greater than 3000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Many DDFs will have the same last term, so you program should report only the first one. If there are
many DDFs with maximum lenght, you should report the one starting with the smallest number.

You can take the exact format from the example below.

```

## Sample Output

```text
200 500
100 150

```
