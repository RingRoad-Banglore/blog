title: Uva 12294  RPG battles

## Input

```
In many typical RPG games, you battle with bad guys, creatures, monsters or ghosts etc. all the time.
After each battle, you may get magic potions that power you up, so youll get stronger and stronger,
and finally defeat the big boss. In this problem, we only consider two kinds of potion: stronger and
double power. If you drink a bottle of stronger potion, your power increases by 1; if you drink a bottle
of double power potion, your power doubles.

How long each battle lasts depends on how powerful you are. Each battle is described by six
parameters: p1, p2, t1, t2, w1, w2. That means, if your power is less than p1, you will be defeated; if
your power is greater than p2, youll need t2 seconds to defeat all the enemies. If your power is between
p1 and p2 (inclusive), the time needed for the battle decreases linearly from t1 to t2. For example, if
p1 = 50, p2 = 75, t1 = 40, t2 = 15, and your power is 55, then the battle lasts for 35 seconds. Note that
the time needed for battles may be non-integers. The last two parameters, w1 and w2, represent the
number of bottles of stronger potion and double power potion you got after winning the battle. Note
that you dont have to drink these potions immediately. You can drink them later if thatll decrease
the total time. You cannot drink potions during a battle, so the time needed for battles is not affected
by the potions.

Given the list of battles, your task is to find a strategy to win all the battles as quickly as possible.
Note that you must enter the battles in order. You cannot redo or skip any battle.
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 25 test cases. Each test begins with two integers n and p (1  n  1000,
1  p  100), the number of battles and your initial power. Each of the next n lines contains 6 integers
p1, p2, t1, t2, w1, w2 (1  p1 < p2  100, 1  t2 < t1  100, 0  w1, w2  10). The input is terminated
by a test case with n = p = 0, you should not process it.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the shortest time (in seconds) to win all the battles, to two digits after the
decimal point. If you cannot win all the battles, print Impossible (without quotes).
