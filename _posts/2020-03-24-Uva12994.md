title: Uva 12994  Palindromic Bases
---


## Input

```text
A palindrome is a number which looks the same when reversed. 1, 11, 343 etc. are examples of
palindromes, while 12, 1122 etc. are not. Interesting thing is, some number may not be palindrome
in decimal but in other bases. For example, if we convert 12 in base 5, (12)10 = (22)5. So we can see
that 12 is a palindrome in base 5. Length of a palindrome is the number of digits in that number. No
leading zeroes are allowed in palindromes.

Given a number N , how many bases B are there, where N will be an even length palindrome if
represented as a B base number.
```

## Output

```text
First line will contain an integer number T (0 < T  100), number of test cases. Each case contains
one line with an integer N (0  N  1014).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case print the case number then the answer. If there are infinite bases possible for a particular
N , you should output Infinity. See sample I/O for more clarification.

Note: Explanation for sample inputs:
Case 1: the base is 2.
Case 2: the base is 3.
Case 3: the bases are 5 and 11.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
3
4
12

```
