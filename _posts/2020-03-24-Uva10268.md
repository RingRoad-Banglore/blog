Looking throw the Online Judges Problem Set Archive I found a very interesting problem number
498, titled Polly the Polynomial. Frankly speaking, I did not solve it, but I derived from it this
problem.

Everything in this problem is a derivative of something from 498. In particular, 498 was ... designed
to help you remember ... basic algebra skills, make the world a better place, etc., etc.. This problem
is designed to help you remember basic derivation algebra skills, increase the speed in which world
becomes a better place, etc., etc.

In 498 you had to evaluate the values of polynomial

a0x
n + a1x

n1 + . . .+ an1x+ an.

In this problem you should evaluate its derivative. Remember that derivative is defined as

a0nx
n1 + a1(n 1)xn2 + . . .+ an1.

All the input and output data will fit into integer, i.e. its absolute value will be less than 231.
```

## Input

```
Your program should accept an even number of lines of text. Each pair of lines will represent one
problem. The first line will contain one integer - a value for x. The second line will contain a list of
integers a0, a1, ..., an1, an, which represent a set of polynomial coefficients.

Input is terminated by <EOF>.

```

## Output

```
For each pair of lines, your program should evaluate the derivative of polynomial for the given value x
and output it in a single line.

```

## Sample Input

```
7
1 -1
2
1 1 1

```

## Sample Output

```
1
5
