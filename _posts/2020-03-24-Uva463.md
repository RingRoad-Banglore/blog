title: Uva 00463  Polynomial Factorization
---


```
A polynomial is of degree k if the largest power of the variable in any term is no greter than k. For
example,

x2 + 4x+ 2

is of degree 2. It is also of degree 3, 4, 5, ...
A polynomial with integer coefficients is prime if it cannot be expressed as the product of two

lower-degree polynomials with integer coefficients.

Write a program to express a 4th degree polynomial with integer coefficients as the product of one
or more prime polynomials.

The first sample below tell us that the polynomial 2x4 + 7x3  x2  6x 2 has prime factors x 1,
2x+ 1 and x2 + 4x+ 2.
```

## Input

```
The input consists on several test cases, one on each line. Each test case consists on 5 integers,
representing the coefficients of a degree 4 polynomial in decreasing order of the variable power from 4
to 0. The first number will never be negative or 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the integer coefficients of each prime factor on a single line, in decreasing order
of variable power. The first coefficient of prime polynomials should be positive, except maybe in the
last polynomial on the list. The polynomials must be printed in increasing order of degree, and when
two or more degrees match they must be sorted by increasing value of coefficients from the greatest to
the lowest degree. Extra factors should be added to the last polynomial on the list.

Print a blank line after each test case.
