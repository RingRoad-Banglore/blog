title: Uva 10693  Traffic Volume
---


```
In the picture below (or above depending on HTML response :)) you can see a street. It has infinite
number of cars on it. The distance between any two consecutive cars is d, length of each car is L and
the velocity of each car is v. The volume of cars through a road means the number of cars passing
through a road in a specific amount of time. When the velocity is constant, d must be minimum for
the volume of cars passing through the road to be maximal. In our model when the velocity of all the
cars is v then the minimum possible value of d is v2/(2f) (The more the car velocity the more distance
you need to bring down your velocity to zero). Here f is the deceleration due to break.

Keeping this model in mind and given the value of L and f your job is to find the value of v for
which the volume of traffic through the road is maximal.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line of input contains two integers L (0 < L  100)
and f (0 < f  10000). The unit of L is meter and the unit of f is meter/second2. The input is
terminated by a single line whose value of L and f is zero.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. Each line contains two floating-
point number v and volume separated by a single space. Here v is the velocity for which traffic flow
is maximal and volume is the maximum number of vehicles (of course it is a fraction) passing through
the road in an hour. These two floating points should have eight digits after the decimal. Errors less
than 1e 5 will be ignored.
