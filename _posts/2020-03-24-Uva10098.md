title: Uva 10098  Generating Fast, Sorted Permutation
---


## Input

```text
Generating permutation has always been an important problem in computer science. In this problem
you will have to generate the permutation of a given string in ascending order. Remember that your
algorithm must be efficient.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer n, which indicates how many strings to follow. The next
n lines contain n strings. Strings will only contain alpha numerals and never contain any space. The
maximum length of the string is 10.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input string print all the permutations possible in ascending order. Not that the strings should
be treated, as case sensitive strings and no permutation should be repeated. A blank line should follow
each output set.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
ab
abc
bca

```
