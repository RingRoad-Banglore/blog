title: Uva 10122  Mysterious Mountain
---


## Input

```text
A group of M people is chasing a very strange ani-
mal. They believe that it will stay on a mysterious
mountain T , so they decided to climb on it and have
a loot. The mountain looks ordinary, shown below:

That is, the outline of the moutain consists of
N+1 segments. The endpoints of them are numbered
0..N+1 from left to right. That is to say, x[i] < x[i+1]
for all 0  i  n. And also, y[0] = y[n + 1] = 0,
1  y[i]  1000 for all 1  y  n.

According to their experience, the animal is most
likely to stay at one of the N endpoits numbered 1..N .
And... funny enough, they soon discover that M =
N , so each of them can choose a different endpoint to seek for the animal.

Initially, they are all at the foot of the mountain. (i.e at (si, 0)) For every person i, he is planing to
go left/right to some place (x, 0) (where x is an integer - they do not want to take time to work out an
accurate place) at the speed of wi, then climb directly to the destination along a straight line(obviously,
no part of the path that he follows can be OVER the mountain - they cant fly) at the speed of ci. They
dont want to miss it this time, so the teamleader wants the latest person to be as early as possible.
How fast can this be done?
```

## Output

```text
The input will contain no more than 10 test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a
single integer N(1leN  100). In the following N + 2 lines, each line contains two integers xi and
yi(0  xi, yi  1000) indicating the coordinate of the i-th endpoints. In the following N lines, each
line contains three intergers ci, wi and si describing a person (1  ci < wi  100, 0  si  1000) - the
climbing speed, walking speed and initial position. The test case containing N = 0 will terminate the
input and should not be regarded as a test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a single line containing the least time that these people must take to complete
the mission, print the answer with two decimal places.

Note:
In this example, Person 1 goes to (5,0) and climbs

to endpoint 2, Person 2 climbs directly to endpoint
3. person 3 goes to (4,0) and climbs to endpoint 1.
