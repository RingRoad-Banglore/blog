title: Uva 00204  Robot Crash
---


## Input

```
The DoD company has contracted to determine under what conditions a pair of scanner robots can
collide. The robots are fired simultaneously from guns that are mounted near opposite ends of a
horizontal strip. They travel in straight lines until they hit a wall of the strip or until they are in the
same spot at the approximately the same time.

Whenever a robot hits a wall, it bounces off without loss of speed and in a straight line so that the
angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

If the robots are in the same spot at approximately the same time, then they collide.
Write a program to determine whether robots collide and if so where. To simplify the computer

model of the physical problem, assume the following.

1) The horizontal strip is 2-dimensional, and it runs left-to-right. Its walls are straight lines.

2) Each robot is a point mass. That is, the circumference of each robot is 0.

3) A robot maintains the speed with which it was originally fired until it collides with the other
robot or until it passes the gun from which the other robot was fired.

4) There are 2 guns, one mounted to the left of the other on a horizontal strip. The initial angle of
the left gun is between -85o and 85o. The initial angle of the right gun is between 95o and 180o
or -95o and -180o. (All angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.)

5) Robots collide when they pass through the same place within 0.5 second of each other.

6) The horizontal strip is 10 units high. For any point (x, y) in the strip, 0  y  10.

7) Robots speeds will be positive.
```

## Output

```
Input for your program is a text file which contains data for several different pairs of robots. The lines
of the text file come in pairs. The first line of a pair gives initial firing information about the robot
fired from the leftmost gun. The second line of the pair gives initial firing information about the robot
fired from the rightmost gun. Each line contains 4 data items as follows:
x-coordinate y-coordinate angle_in_degrees speed (reals)

The end of input is indicated by end-of-file. Assume that the input is error-free.

## Sample Input

```
For each robot problem, output from your program should consist of the number of the problem (ex:
Robot Problem #1, Robot Problem #2), and a statement indicating whether or not the robots do
collide. If they do collide, your program should also print the coordinates of the point of collision.

If there are multiple collisions, only print the first one. If there are multiple collisions at the same
time, only print the one with smallest x-coordinate.

All real output should be printed with 2 digits to the right of the decimal. Print a blank line after
each robot problem.

Notes:
Assume that a = b only if |a b| <  = 107
To help maintain floating point accuracy when converting degrees to radians, use the predeclared

constant pi.
