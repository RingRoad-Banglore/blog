title: Uva 10957  So Doku Checker
---


```
The best logical puzzles often are puzzles that
are based on a simple idea. So Doku is one such
type of puzzle. Although So Dokus have been
around for some twenty years, in the last few
years they conquered the world exponentially.
Hundreds of newspapers and websites are now
publishing them on a daily basis. For those of
you unfamiliar with these puzzles, let me give
a brief introduction.

The picture above contains an example of
a Su Doku puzzle. As you can see, we have a
9  9 grid filled with single digits from 1 to 9
and empty places. The grid is further divided
into nine 33 sub-grids, indicated by the thick
lines. To solve the puzzle you have to fill the
empty places with digits according to the fol-
lowing rules:

 Every row should contain the digits 1 to
9 exactly once;

 Every column should contain the digits 1 to 9 exactly once;

 Every 3 3 sub-grid should contain the digits 1 to 9 exactly once.

A well formed Su Doku can be solved with paper and pencil using logical deduction only. To be
well formed it should be legal (no row, column or sub-grid contains a digit more than once), solvable
(the empty places can all be filled while respecting the rules) and unique (there is only one solution).
This is what your program is going to check.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several (partially) filled grids, each representing a Su Doku puzzle. For every puzzle
there are 9 lines with 9 digits giving the puzzle in row major order. Empty places in the puzzle are
represented by the digit 0 (zero). Digits on a line are separated by one space. The grids are separated
by one empty line.

The first grid in the sample input represents the puzzle given in the picture.

```

## Output

```
For every grid in the input, determine one of the following four verdicts:

 Illegal if the puzzle violates one of the three rules;

 Unique if only one solution exists;

 Ambiguous if more than one solution exists;

 Impossible if no solution exists;

Print one line per grid, in the format: Case < N >: < V ERDICT >., where N is the case
number, starting from 1, and V ERDICT is one of the four words in the list. See the sample output
for the exact format.

Note: an Illegal puzzle is also Impossible, of course, but your program should print Illegal
in that case. Only print Impossible if the input doesnt violate one of the three rules, but the puzzle
still cant be solved.

EPILOGUE (not required to solve the problem)
The (unique) solution to the given puzzle is:

1 5 3 9 8 4 7 6 2
8 4 2 7 3 6 1 5 9
6 9 7 5 1 2 8 3 4
2 3 8 6 7 1 4 9 5
9 7 4 3 2 5 6 1 8
5 1 6 8 4 9 3 2 7
7 6 5 4 9 3 2 8 1
3 8 1 2 5 7 9 4 6
4 2 9 1 6 8 5 7 3

If you are interested in the fascinating world of Su Dokus and solving them by hand, Google is a
good starting point. Also Wikipedia has a nice entry on Su Dokus describing their history and giving
some mathematical background.
