## Input

```text
Have you ever hoped to change history, like me? I guess so.

Many people think its logically impossible to change history, because the new history would evolve
into a new present (here present means now, not gift), leading to some contradicting facts.

While I havent find a way to do time-travel and change history (if you know the way,
please tell me!!!), at least I dont think its logically impossible, because we can never
sense the whole world (or worlds, if you believe in parallel universe/multiverse theory. See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse). If were clever enough, we can make a very small
change to the history, which would evolve into a different, but consistent present (that means we cant
sense the difference), which would in turn evolve into a better future!

Lets make a thought experiment (See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment):

 There are x possible events in the past, labeled a1  ax.

 There are y possible events now (but some of them may be unable to sense), labeled b1  by.

 There are z possible events that may happen in near future, labeled c1  cz.

 Present events only depend on past events, with known deterministic rules.

 Future events only depend on present events, with known deterministic rules.

 Make some changes to the past events (happened->not happened, and vice versa) so that the
sensed present events remain the same, then some of the future events will change.

All these future events are good, so I want to maximize the number of these future events that will
actually happen, by changing some of the past events. If there are more than one way to change history,
make the smallest change (i.e. change the minimal number of past events).

To simplify the problem, each of the rules mentioned above is described by event = formula,
where formula is a string representation of a boolean formula which satisfies:

 Only three operators: AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!) are supported.

 NOT has the highest priority and will not be repeated. i.e. !!x is invalid (but !(!x) is valid).

 AND and OR has the medium and lowest priority. The associativity of both AND and OR is
leftto-right. i.e. x&&y&&z is actually (x&&y)&&z.

 Parentheses have usual meanings.

 There will be no whitespace characters within the formula.

## Output

```text
The first line contains a single integer T (T  1000), the number of test cases. Each test case begins
with three positive integers x, y, z (1  x, y, z  15). The second line contains x 0-1 integers, describing
the past (before we change it). The i-th integer is 1 if and only if event ai happened in the past. Each
of the following y lines contains the formula of b1  by (in this order). If the formula is preceded by
an asterisk (*), that means we can sense whether that event is happening now (i.e. that boolean
variable should not be changed). Otherwise that event cant be sensed. The following z lines contain
the formulae of c1  cz (in this order), in the same format, except that there will be no asterisks. The
lines containing rules will not have any whitespace characters inside.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print Increased from a to b.. If were unable to get more good future events,
print Unable to improve future.. If there is any solution, print the list of changed past event in
the second line. If there is more than one solution, print the lexicographically smallest (when doing
comparison, regard the solution as a list of integers).

Print a blank line after each test case.

```
