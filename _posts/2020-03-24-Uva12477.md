title: Uva 12477  Good Measures of Dispersion
---


## Input

```
A deadly war is going on between two neighboring states, A and B. The army of B established N
bunkers in the frontline numbered by 1, 2, ..., N . The chief of the army of A knows very well about the
new intake of soldiers of B in the bunkers. He wants to attack and destroy each bunker of B. He needs
to know about the strength of the bunkers very frequently. He is more concerned about some very good
measures of dispersion of a segment of bunkers because he needs to know how much the strength varies
among them.

Here, he mainly wants to know the Range and Variance of strengths of a segment. Range is the
absolute difference between the minimum and maximum values of a segment. Variance of a set of
numbers x1, x2, , xm is defined as follows

V (x) =

m
i=1(xi  x)

2

m
, where x =

m
i=1 xi
m
```

## Output

```
There will be T (T  12) test cases in the input file. First line of the input contains two positive
integers, N (N  100, 000) and Q (Q  100, 000). The next line contains N integers which indicate the
initial strengths of the N bunkers. The absolute value of the initial strength of any bunker can be at
most 1,000.

Each of the next Q lines starts with a number (0, 1, or 2), which indicates the type of operation.
2 is followed by 2 integers, st and nd, which indicate that the chief wants to know the Variance and
Range of current strengths between st and nd, inclusive. 0 and 1 are followed by 3 integers, st, nd
and x (1  st  nd  N and 1, 000  x  1, 000). Each line starting with 0 means x is the new
strength of each bunker between st and nd, inclusive. Each line starting with 1 means x is added to
the strength of each bunker between st and nd, inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output the Case < x >: in the first line (where x = case number) and from the
second line output the Variance and Range for each type 2 operations in a separate line as shown in
the sample output. The Variance should be printed as a fraction, reduced to the lowest terms. The
absolute value of numerator or denominator will never be greater than 2631, even before the reduction
of the fraction to the lowest terms.

Intermediate overflow will not occur with proper use of 64-bit signed integer.
