title: Uva 13096  Standard Deviation
---


## Input

```text
In mathematics, the standard deviation of a set of n integer numbers is defined as:

S =


ni=1(xi  x)2

n 1

where x is the average of the set of n integer numbers for which the standard deviation is being
calculated. That average is calculated as:

x =
1

n


n
i=1

xi

The task is to calculate, in an efficient way, the standard deviation of the first n odd positive
integer numbers.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases in the input. Each test case consists of a single line containing a positive
integer number n (2  n  106) which indicates the amount of consecutive odd numbers (starting from
one) that should be considered when calculating the standard deviation. The last test case has a value
of 0, for which you shouldnt generate any response.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, you should print a single line containing a floating point number: the standard
deviation of the first n odd positive numbers. The absolute error of your answer should not be greater
than 106.

```

## Sample Output
