title: Uva 01382  Distant Galaxy
---


## Input

```

You are observing a distant galaxy using a telescope above the Astronomy Tower, and you think that a
rectangle drawn in that galaxy whose edges are parallel to coordinate axes and contain maximum star
systems on its edges has a great deal to do with the mysteries of universe. However you do not have
the laptop with you, thus you have written the coordinates of all star systems down on a piece of paper
and decide to work out the result later. Can you finish this task?
```

## Output

```
There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each test case starts with one integer N , (1  N  100),
the number of star systems on the telescope. N lines follow, each line consists of two integers: the X
and Y coordinates of the K-th planet system. The absolute value of any coordinate is no more than
109, and you can assume that the planets are arbitrarily distributed in the universe.

N = 0 indicates the end of input file and should not be processed by your program.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the maximum value you have found on a single line in the format as indicated
in the sample output.
