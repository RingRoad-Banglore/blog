title: Uva 00837  Light and Transparencies
---


## Input

```text
When light traverses a transparent film, some energy is absorbed and the rest is transmitted to other
side of the film. The percentage of light that is transmitted may be defined as Transparency Coefficient.

When several films are in the same direction of light, the correspondent transparency coefficients
are multiplied. The goal of this problem is to determine the percentage of light that is projected on the
ground, after traversing a given set of films.

Figure 1 Three films and correspondent Transparent Coeficients.

Consider the set of lines segments in fig. 1. They represent transparent films in the above conditions
(transparency coefficients are written in brackets). Also consider that light is propagating in the vertical
direction, from top to bottom.

Accordingly to the figure, the end points of the lines define a set of projected segments onto the
ground (ground is represented by the X axe). For each projected segment, it is possible to evaluate the
percentage of light that reaches the ground and, for the entire set of segments, a list can be obtained:

-inf, 2.0 -> 1.000
2.0, 4.0 -> 0.900
4.0, 7.0 -> 0.630
7.0, 9.0 -> 0.504
9.0, 13.5 -> 0.560
13.0, 17.0 -> 0.800
17.0, +inf -> 1.000

To simplify the problem, it is assumed that neither vertical lines nor crossing lines are given. Also
no coincidences exist in the vertical projection of all given points (in other words, the X coordinates
of the end points are all different from each other). On the other hand, a coordinate may be any real
value from  to +.

## Output

```text
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 837  Light and Transparencies 2/2

The input is a text file containing several lines, as follows.
The first line of the input contains the number NL (integer format) of line segments. It is followed

by NL lines of text defining, each one, a line segment.
Accordingly to the above explanations, a line segment is defined by the coordinates of its two end

points P1 and P2 and the transparency coefficient r, in the sequence x1 y1 x2 y2 r, separated by single
spaces (all the five values are in the real format). No order is considered for the two points P1 and P2.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The first line of the output contains the number NP (integer format) of projected segments. It is
followed by NP lines of text, defining, each one, a projected segment. These lines must be sorted in
ascending order of X values.

A projected segment must be defined by its coordinates X1 and X2, followed by the evaluated
percentage of light. All the tree values must be in real format, rounded to 3 decimal digits and
separated by single spaces. Infinite values must be represented by -inf or +inf.
