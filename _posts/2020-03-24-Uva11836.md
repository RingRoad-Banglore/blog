## Input

```
Long ago in a galaxy far, far away, there was an empire that dominated all others. A rebel alliance,
unhappy with this situation, decided to fight these forces, with the objective of restoring democracy
and peace for all nations.

Captain Cael, one of the rebel commanders, is sailing through space with his space cruiser, when
he suddenly detects the presence of a ship of the Empire (according to the aesthetic standards of the
time, all ships are tetrahedra). After a moment of surprise, Cael realizes he is in firing range and may
place a cannon at any point of his ship.

As the power of his gun is fixed, Cael wants to position the cannon so that the distance traveled
by the energy beam to the Empires ship is minimal, to maximize the damage. Therefore, he asked
that you, sub-master Cin Talig, compute the shortest distance between the rebel spacecraft and the
spacecraft of the Empire.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer T , indicating the
number of test cases. Each of the T test cases consists of eight lines, each line describing the coordinate
of a vertex of a ship. The first four lines describe the vertices of the rebel spacecraft, the following four
lines describe the vertices of the spacecraft of the Empire.

Each coordinate description is a line containing three integers X, Y , Z indicating the coordinate of
the vertex in space (103  X  103, 103  Y  103 , 103  Z  103). The four corners of each
ship always define a tetrahedron of nonzero volume, and the two ships are always disjoint.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input your program must print a line containing a single number, printed with
precision of two decimal digits, indicating the minimum distance between the two spacecrafts. The
distance between the two ships is always greater than zero.
