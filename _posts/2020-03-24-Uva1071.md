title: Uva 01071  The Hare and the Hounds
---


```
A hare and hounds road rally requires contestants (the hounds) to identify a route of one or more roads
selected by the organizer (the hare). Both parties move over roads that meet at various intersections.
Upon entering any intersection (except special ones to be described shortly), both the hound and the
hare select routes using the main road rule. The main road rule is always straight as possible, meaning
make the smallest turn (perhaps none) necessary to continue. If there are two such choices possible
(such as at some Y intersections), the main road rule dictates the rightmost (from the point of view
of the hound) of the two acceptable alternatives should be selected.

At certain intersections, the hare may violate the main road rule by taking a random road away from
the intersection (though never the original road used to reach the intersection). These intersections are
marked by the hare as choice points (usually by a colored mark on the pavement in the intersection).
When reaching a choice point, the hound must try each road leaving the intersection and travel that
road (potentially traveling through other intersections) until reaching a confirmation marker (usually
some flour dumped by the hare on the road) confirming the correct route selection. An incorrect route
selection is indicated by one of the following:

 The hound travels a specified maximum distance from the choice point before reaching a confir-
mation marker.

 The hound reaches a dead end (an intersection with only one road to it) before reaching the
confirmation marker.

 The hound reaches a choice point before reaching the confirmation marker. (The hare always
places a confirmation marker on the route following a choice point. Also, the hare never returns
to a previous choice point.)

After detecting an incorrect route, the hound must trace back along the route taken to the choice
point and select a different route alternative. If the hound encounters the endpoint while looking for a
confirmation marker, he ignores it.

When selecting routes from a choice point, the hound uses the main road rule in a slightly different
way. The first road selected is the same as if the intersection were not a choice point. But if the hound
must return to the choice point (i.e., the first road taken from the choice point was not part of the hares
route), then the hound chooses the second road using the main road rule from the direction with which
he returns to the choice point (ignoring any direction that he has already tried as well as the direction
that he originally arrived from). This process repeats each time the hound returns to the choice point
until he finds the proper route. This multiple use of the main road rule occurs only at choice points.
For the purposes of this problem, the hound will not remember the result of traveling down any road,
even if he returns to it multiple times while exploring one choice point.

For this problem you will be given a road map (a configuration of roads and intersections), the list
of choice point intersections, the placement of confirmation markers, the maximum distance from a
choice point to a confirmation marker, the starting and ending intersections (neither of which will be
choice points), and the direction to be used in leaving the starting intersection. Using this information,
you will simulate the hounds search for the hares route. You may assume that the hound, using the
strategy described, will always discover and trace the hares route.

## Input

```
There may be multiple input test cases. The data for each case begins with a line containing 7 integers:
ncp (number of choice point intersections), nroad (number of roads, never larger than 150), ncm
(number of confirmation markers, never more than 100), confdist (maximum distance from a choice
point intersection to the confirmation marker, at most 2000), startisect (starting intersection number),
endisect (ending intersection number), and startdir (the direction of the starting road). Intersections
are identified using integers between 1 and 100.

The starting line for each case is immediately followed by a line containing ncp integers giving the
identifying numbers of the choice point intersections.

Next there are nroad lines. Roads are identified using sequential integers starting with 1, matching
the order in which their specification lines appear in the input. Each such line contains 5 integers: the
identifying numbers of the two intersections connected by the road, the compass directions (from 0 to
359 degrees, 0 is north, 90 is east) with which the road leaves the intersections, and the length of the
road. Each road can be traveled in both directions and no two roads will enter an intersection at the
same angle.

Finally there are ncm lines that identify the placement of the confirmation markers. Each of these
lines contains three integers giving the identifying number of an intersection, the identifying number
of a road leaving that intersection, and the distance from the intersection to the confirmation marker.
Confirmation markers will not be placed at intersections. Confirmation markers also will not be dropped
along roads that start/end in the same intersection.

Input for the last case is followed by a line containing 7 zeroes.

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number (starting with 1), the length of the hares route, the length of
the hounds search (including all incorrect paths taken at choice points), and the road numbers in the
hares route in the order the hare traveled them, using the format shown in the sample data. Print a
blank line after the output for each case.
