title: Uva 12558  Egyptian Fractions HARD version
---


```
Given a fraction a/b, write it as a sum of different Egyptian fraction. For example, 2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6.
There is one restriction though: there are k restricted integers that should not be used as a denominator.

For example, if we cant use 2..6, the best solution is:

2/3 = 1/7 + 1/9 + 1/10 + 1/12 + 1/14 + 1/15 + 1/18 + 1/28

The number of terms should be minimized, and then the large denominator should be minimized.
If there are several solutions, the second largest denominator should be minimized etc.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case begins with three integers
a, b, k (2  a < b  876, 0  k  5, gcd(a, b) = 1). The next line contains k different positive integers
not greater than 1000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the optimal solution, formatted as below.
Extremely Important Notes

Its not difficult to see some inputs are harder than others. For example, these inputs are very hard
input for every program I have:

596/829=1/2+1/5+1/54+1/4145+1/7461+1/22383
265/743=1/3+1/44+1/2972+1/4458+1/24519
181/797=1/7+1/12+1/2391+1/3188+1/5579
616/863=1/2+1/5+1/80+1/863+1/13808+1/17260
22/811=1/60+1/100+1/2433+1/20275
732/733=1/2+1/3+1/7+1/45+1/7330+1/20524+1/26388

However, I dont want to give up this problem due to those hard inputs, so Id like to restrict the
input to easier inputs only. I know that its not a perfect problem, but its true that you can still
have fun and learn something, isnt it?

Some tips:

1. Watch out for floating-point errors if you use double to store intermediate result. We didnt use
double.

2. Watch out for arithmetic overflows if you use integers to store intermediate result. We carefully
checked our programs for that.
