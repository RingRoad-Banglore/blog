title: Uva 10463  Aztec Knights
---


## Input

```text
Aztecs warriors are great fighters. It is obvious that aztecs have their own version of knight. Its their
own version because their knights moves in a different way than the usual knights. You know that usual
knights always move horizontally or vertically but aztec knights always move diagonally. Yes, thats
the difference. Look at the following two pictures to see the difference. Dont get confused with the
path shown in the picture. We count one knight move when the knight moves from the blue square to
any one of the red squares.

Fig 1: Usual knights moves Fig 2: Aztec knights moves

An Aztec knight does a weird thing when it moves from one place to another. It doesnt stop at a
place if it doesnt reach that place in prime number of moves. Given the initial and final position of
the knight, is it possible to determine whether the knight can reach the destination and stop there or
not? The knight doesnt come back to a place which it already visited.
```

## Output

```text
There can be several set of inputs. A set starts with a pair of integers m and n (4  m,n  15). m
and n are the number of rows and columns of the terrain respectively. Next, there will be srow and
scol indicating the current position of the knight. Finally, two more integers drow and dcol indicating
the destination of the knight. The upper left most corner of the terrain is denoted as (0,0). The Input
ends at EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Print CASE# X:  before every set of output where X is the case number. Print a line of the format
The knight takes l prime moves. where l is the minimum prime number of moves required to reach
the destination starting from the initial position. Print The knight takes l composite move(s).
if it is not possible to reach in prime number of moves but possible in composite number of moves and
l is the minimum number of composite move required. Print Destination is not reachable. if
destination is unreachable.
