title: Uva 11693  Speedy Escape
---


## Input

```
The Newton brothers are planning to rob a bank in the city of Alviso
and want to figure out a way to escape the citys only police car. They
know that their car is faster than the police car so if they could just
reach one of the highways exiting the city they will be able to speed
away from the police.

The police car has a maximum speed of 160 km/h. Luckily, the
brothers know where the police car will start (its parked at the police
station). To be on the safe side they assume that the police car will
start moving as soon as they leave the bank and start their car (this is
when the alarm goes off).

The brothers want to find a fixed route that ensures that they are able to leave the city no matter
what route the police car take and at what speed it drives. However, since the brothers are not very
confident drivers they dont want to drive faster than necessary. Luckily they have recently invested in
a new hi-tech in-car police escape system that you have constructed. This system will tell them what
the minimal top speed needed to escape is (and probably other useful things like what route to take).

Lets turn the clock back a bit to the time when you were constructing the escape system and
focused on finding the minimal required speed. Can you get it right?

You may treat all roads as infinitesimally narrow and both cars as point objects. If the brothers ever
end up at the same point (on any road or intersection) at the same time as the police car they will be
caught and by Murphys law if there is any possibility of this happening it will happen. The two cars
start simultaneously and can accelerate/decelerate instantaneously at any time to any speed below or
equal to its maximum speed. They can also change roads at intersections or direction anywhere on a
road instantaneously no matter what speed they are traveling at.

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N < 32) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

The first line consists of three integers n, m and e, where 2  n  100 describe the number of
intersections, 1  m  5000 describes the number of roads in the city and 1  e  n describes the
number of highway exits. Then follow m lines, each consisting of three integers a, b, l such that 1  a <
b  n and 1  l  100 describing a road of length l hundred meters from intersection a to intersection
b. Then follows a line of e integers, each one a number in 1, , n describing which intersections are
connected to highway exits. Finally there is a line with two integers b and p (1  b, p  n and b = p)
describing the intersections where the brothers and the police cars start, respectively.

It will always be possible to travel from any intersection to any other intersection. Roads are only
connected at intersection points (although they may cross using bridges or tunnels at others points).
Roads can be used in both directions but there cannot be more than one road between two intersections.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print the minimal speed in km/h required to escape or the word IMPOSSIBLE if it
is impossible. If the output is not IMPOSSIBLE, any answer with either absolute or relative error
smaller than 106 is acceptable.
