## Input

```text
Allied Chute Manufacturers is a company that
builds trash chutes. A trash chute is a hol-
low tube installed in buildings so that trash
dropped in at the top will fall down and be col-
lected in the basement. Designing trash chutes
is actually highly nontrivial. Depending on
what kind of trash people are expected to drop
into them, the trash chute needs to have an
appropriate size. And since the cost of man-
ufacturing a trash chute is proportional to its
size, the company always would like to build a
chute that is as small as possible. Choosing the
right size can be tough though.

We will consider a 2-dimensional simplifi-
cation of the chute design problem. A trash
chute points straight down and has a constant
width. Objects that will be dropped into the
trash chute are modeled as polygons. Before an object is dropped into the chute it can be rotated so
as to provide an optimal fit. Once dropped, it will travel on a straight path downwards and will not
rotate in flight. The following figure shows how an object is first rotated so it fits into the trash chute.

Your task is to compute the smallest chute width that will allow a given polygon to pass through.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer n (3 
n  100), the number of points in the polygon that models the trash item.

The next n lines then contain pairs of integers xi and yi (0  xi, yi  104), giving the coordinates
of the polygon vertices in order. All points in one test case are guaranteed to be mutually distinct and
the polygon sides will never intersect. (Technically, there is one inevitable exception of two neighboring
sides sharing their common vertex. Of course, this is not considered an intersection.)

The last test case is followed by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, display its case number followed by the width of the smallest trash chute through
which it can be dropped. Display the minimum width with exactly two digits to the right of the
decimal point, rounding up to the nearest multiple of 1/100. Answers within 1/100 of the correct
rounded answer will be accepted.

Follow the format of the sample output.
