title: Uva 12816  Isosceles Triangles
---


## Input

```text

An isosceles triangle is the one in which exactly two of its sides have the same length. A point in the
plane is given by two coordinates, (x, y).

The following graph shows the idea.

Figure 1: Six points, enough to form a few triangles

Your task is to create an algorithm that answers, given N points, how many isosceles triangles do
they form?
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. For each test case, the first line has an integer N , the number
of points. The next N lines contain two integers, Xi and Yi, indicating the points in the plane.

1  N  100; 100  Xi, Yi  100

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a single line with an integer, representing the total number of isosceles triangles
formed by the N points.

To avoid rounding errors, make sure that in your program two lengths La, Lb are considered equal
if |La  Lb| < 106.
