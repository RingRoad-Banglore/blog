title: Uva 12976  Greedy Artisan
---


## Input

```
On their way to the next World Finals, Mr. Ed and his pals are visiting the beautiful city of Moscow.
One of their favorite tourism activities is buying souvenirs to bring back home, so they are looking for
matryoshkas in a big artisan market close to the Red Square.

In the market, there is a very greedy and clever artisan that sells custom sets of matryoshkas. This
artisan has n different matryoshkas in stock, each one having a unique identifier i (1  i  n), a size si
and a base price pi. As the artisan is really clever, he offers a special deal to his clients:

Assume someone wants to buy the custom set T = {i1, i2, . . . , in} of m matryoshkas.
Let us call imax to the identifier of the matryoshka with the

maximum size and, in case there are multiple matryoshkas with
maximum size, the maximum price in T , then the price one has
to pay to buy T is

price(T ) =

m
j=1

sij
simax

 pimax

Mr. Ed wants to exploit the artisans deal buying exactly k
matryoshkas, regardless which are the sizes of each matryoshka.
Please determine the minimum number of money he needs to
expend.
```

## Output

```
The input will contain several test cases. The first line of each test case contains 2 space-separated
integers n and k, representing the number of matryoshkas the artisan has in stock and the number of
matryoshkas Mr. Ed wants to buy (1  n  100, 000 and 1  k  n).

There will follow n lines. The i-th line contains 2 integers si and pi, representing the size and the
base price of the i-th matryoshka (1  si, pi  106). There may be matryoshkas with the same si and
pi.

The last test case is followed by a single line containing 2 zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print a single line with a real number with 6 digits after the decimal point representing
the minimum price Mr. Ed has to pay to buy k matryoshkas (see format below).
