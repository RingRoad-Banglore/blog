title: Uva 01099  Sharing Chocolate

## Input

```
Chocolate in its many forms is enjoyed by millions of people around the world every day. It is a truly
universal candy available in virtually every country around the world.

You find that the only thing better than eating chocolate is to share it with friends. Unfortunately
your friends are very picky and have different appetites: some would like more and others less of the
chocolate that you offer them. You have found it increasingly difficult to determine whether their
demands can be met. It is time to writte a program that solves the problem once and for all!

Your chocolate comes as a rectangular bar. The bar consists of same-sized rectangular pieces. To
share the chocolate you may break one bar into two pieces along a division between rows or columns of
the bar. You or the may then repeatedly break the resulting pieces in the same manner. Each of your
friends insists on a getting a single rectangular portion of the chocolate that has a specified number of
pieces. You are a little bit insistent as well: you will break up your bar only if all of it can be distributed
to your friends, with none left over.

For exampla, Figure 9 shows one way that a chocolate bar consisting of 3  4 pieces can be split
into 4 parts that contain 6, 3, 2, and 1 pieces respectively, by breanking it 3 times (This corresponds
to the first sample input.)
```

## Output

```
The input consists of multiple test cases each describing a chocolate bar to share. Each description
starts with a line containing a single integer n (1  n  15), the number of parts in which the bar is
supposed to be split. This is followed by a line containing two integers x and y (1  x, y  100), the
dimensions of the chocolate bar. The next line contains n positive integers, giving the number of pieces
that are supposed to be in each of the n parts.

The input is terminated by a line containing the integer zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, first display its case number. Then display whether it is possible to break the
chocolate in the desired way: display Yes if it is possible, and No otherwise. Follow the format of the
sample output.
