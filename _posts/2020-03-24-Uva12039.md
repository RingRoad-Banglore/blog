title: Uva 12039  Goldbachs Cardinality
---


## Input

```text
Goldbachs cardinality (GC) of an even number means the number of ways the even number can be
expressed as summation of 2 different primes. For example 30 = 7 + 23 = 11 + 19 = 13 + 17. So
Goldbachs cardinality of 30 is 3. In other words we can write that GC(30) = 3. In this problem you
will have to find the summation of Goldbachs Cardinality of all even numbers within a certain range.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains around 2000 line of input.

Each line contains two integers low and high (0 < low  high  107). Input is terminated by a line
containing two zeroes. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input you have to produce one line of output. This line contains the summation of
Goldbachs cardinality of all the even numbers within low and high (inclusive). In other words you will
have to print the value of

high/2
m=(low+1)/2

GC(2m)

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 20
30 40
0 0

```
