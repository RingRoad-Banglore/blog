title: Uva 01692  Labyrinth of the Minotaur
---


```

The Minotaur is a half-bull half-man creature living in the Cretan Labyrinth. He terrorizes the whole
Crete, especially the city of Minos. Every year seven young boys and girls are sent to the Labyrinth to
please the Minotaur. After each sacrifice the Minotaur sleeps for a while.

Theseus, brave Greek hero half-god half-man, just came to Minos. The people of Minos ask him to
kill the Minotaur. Unfortunately, the Minotaur is not an easy target to kill. Theseus doubts his ability
to kill even sleeping Minotaur. So he decided to block the Minotaur inside his own Labyrinth.

The Labyrinth has a rectangular shape divided into square cells of equal size. Each cell is either
empty of blocked. Blocked cells are impassable even for the Minotaur. The entrance to the Labyrinth
is located in one corner of the Labyrinth, while the Minotaurs lair is located in the opposite corner.

Theseus has only one chance to block the Minotaur  while he is asleep after sacrifice quickly build
a square obstacle that blocks some of the Labyrinths cells. The cells that the obstacle is built on must
be empty. The Minotaur is blocked if there is no way from his lair to the entrance of the Labyrinth.

Certainly, the obstacle cannot block the Minotaurs lair cell (you cannot build something a top
of the Minotaur, even on a sleeping one), as well as the entrance cell (Theseus must not block the
Labyrinth completely).

You have to calculate the minimum possible size of the square obstacle that is able to block the
Minotaur.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of the input contains a pair of positive integer numbers w and h  the width and the
height of the Labyrinth (2  w, h  1500).

The following h lines contain map of the Labyrinth. Each of them has length of w characters.
Empty cells are denoted by dots (.) and blocked cells  by number signs (#).

The entrance is located in the upper-left corner (cell (1, 1)) and the Minotaurs lair is located in
the bottom-right corner (cell (w, h)). Both of these cells are empty and there is at least one way from
the entrance to the Minotaurs lair.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write to the output on a line by itself.

Output three integer numbers l, x and y  the length of side of the minimum possible square
obstacle that is able to block the Minotaur inside the Labyrinth, and the coordinates of its upper left
cell. If there are multiple pairs of possible coordinates, output any of them. The obstacle must not
contain any blocked cells, as well as the Labyrinth entrance or the Minotaurs lair. If it is not possible
to build a square obstacle that blocks the Minotaur, output a single word Impossible.
