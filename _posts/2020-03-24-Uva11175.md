title: Uva 11175  From D to E and back
---


```
Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined.

Samuel Goldwyn

Take any directed graph D with n vertices and m edges. You can make the Lying graph E of B in
the following way. E will have m vertices, one for each edge of D. For example, if D has an edge uv,
then E will have a vertex called uv. Now, whenever D has edges uv and vw, E will have an edge from
vertex uv to vertex vw. There are no other edges in E.

You will be given a graph E and will have to determine whether it is possible for E to be the Lying
graph of some directed graph D.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (N < 220). N test cases follow. Each one starts
with two lines containing m (0  m  300) and k. The next k lines will each contain a pair of vertices,
x and y, meaning that there is an edge from x to y in E. The vertices are numbered from 0 to m 1

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by either Yes or No, depending on
whether E is a valid Lying graph or not. Note that D is allowed to have duplicate edges and self-edges.
