Dealing with chemicals is a risky job, particularly if it is reactive. Reactive chemicals can be dangerous
if not stored in an appropriate environment. As a result, sophisticated instruments that can support
real-time processing, is required while transferring a reactive chemical from one part of a chemical plant
to another one. However, instruments that can ensure strictly real-time service, is too much costly &
hence chemical plants use networks that provide real-time transfer with some tolerance.

Let us be a bit more elaborate. In our concerned chem-
ical plant, there are V pits. Pits are places where chemicals
can be stored. In order to reduce cost, they are not facili-
tated with reactive chemical handling environment. So, for
every second the reactive chemical stays in some of these
pits, they are decayed by 1 milligram. The pits are num-
bered from 1 to V . There is a safe storage attached to pit
S. No time is required to move to the storage from pit S.
There is some reactive chemical weighing W milligram in
pit 1 at time 0. This chemical is to be transported to the
safe storage. Note that, the safe storage door is opened
exactly at time T . So, if the chemical reaches the storage
before time T , you will have to accept decaying of the chem-
ical whereas if it reaches after time T , it can not enter the
safe storage. There are E transfer tubes in the network.
The transfer tubes have suitable environment for storing
reactive chemicals inside them. So, the chemicals are not
decayed inside the tubes. Each transfer tube connects two
pits with an entry point in pit s and an exit point in pit d.
For each tube t, the entry point door is opened for any 1
second between time sst&sct (sst  sct) but we dont ex-
actly know in which second it is opened. Similarly, the exit
point door is opened for any single second between time
dst&dct (dst  dct). As you dont know the exact timing of the doors opening, if we want to move the
chemical from pit s to pit d using tube t, it must be available at pit s no later than time sst. If the
chemical reaches a particular pit x using tube y with exit point range dsy&dcy (dsy  dcy) & leaves
this pit using tube z with entry point range ssz&scz (ssz  scz), the maximum possible decay in that
pit is sczdsy. Please note that, while choosing the tube to get out from a pit, you must always select
a tube with its opening interval beginning no sooner than the latest possible time for the chemical to
enter that pit. For instance, in the 3rd sample test case, the chemical will always leave pit 2 using the
3rd edge even if it reaches pit 2 at time 15.

Write a program to find a way to transfer the chemical from pit 1 to the safe storage with maximum
guaranteed weight left (in milligram) in the storage i.e. with minimum guaranteed decay. Please note
that, the chemical can not have negative weight at any point.

## Input

```
The input file contains multiple test cases. First line of each test case contains three integers, V
(1  V  50, 000), E (1  E  100, 000) & W (1  W  2, 000, 000, 000). The next line has two
integers, S (1  S  V ) & T (0  T  2, 000, 000, 000)

Each of the following E lines describes a tube. A Tube t is described with 6 integers, s (1  s  V ),
d (1  d  V ), sst, sct, dst, dct (0  sst  sct < dst  dct  2, 000, 000, 000) where s, d, sst, sct, dst
& dct holds the meaning as in problem statement.

The end of input is denoted with a case where V = E = W =0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a single line of the form, Plant C: L where C is the test case number and
L is the weight of the chemical available in the safe storage at time T .

First Sample Illustration:
The diagram on the right depicts the

first case in sample. The chemical starts
at time 0 in pit 1. Then goes to 2 by
the ([5,6] [9,11]) edge. Minimum guaran-
teed decay at 1 is 6. Then 2 to 3 via the
([13,15] [25 ,28]) edge. Minimum guar-
anteed decay is 6. Then 3 to 1 through
tube ([ 30,31] [39,40]). Again with 6 min-
imum guaranteed decay. Finally 1 to 2
by the ([41,42] [48,49]) edge. The mini-
mum guaranteed decay is 3 at node 1 &
2 at the destination.
