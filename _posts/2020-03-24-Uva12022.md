title: Uva 12022  Ordering T-shirts
---


## Input

```text
Working in a boutique folding and putting in order T-shirts according to their sizes seems very easy.
But is it really so simple?

Given n objects of different sizes, how many different arrangements can be done using relationships
< and =?

For instance, with 2 objects, A and B, we have 3 possible arrangements:

A=B A<B B<A

With 3 objects, A, B and C, you must conclude that 13 different arrangements exist:

A=B=C A=B<C A<B=C A<B<C A<C<B A=C<B B<A=C B<A<C B<C<A B=C<A
C<A=B C<A<B C<B<A
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer, t, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case,
one line appears, that contains a number n, 1  n  11, representing the number of objects.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output should contain a single line with the number representing the different
arrangements you can do with n objects.

```

## Sample Output

```text
