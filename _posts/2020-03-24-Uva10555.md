title: Uva 10555  Dead Fraction
---


## Input

```text
Mike is frantically scrambling to finish his thesis at the last
minute. He needs to assemble all his research notes into vaguely
coherent form in the next 3 days. Unfortunately, he notices that
he had been extremely sloppy in his calculations. Whenever he
needed to perform arithmetic, he just plugged it into a calculator
and scribbled down as much of the answer as he felt was rele-
vant. Whenever a repeating fraction was displayed, Mike simply
recorded the first few digits followed by . For instance, instead
of 1/3 he might have written down 0.3333. Unfortunately,
his results require exact fractions! He doesnt have time to redo
every calculation, so he needs you to write a program (and FAST!)
to automatically deduce the original fractions.

To make this tenable, he assumes that the original fraction is always the simplest one that produces
the given sequence of digits; by simplest, he means the the one with smallest denominator. Also, he
assumes that he did not neglect to write down important digits; no digit from the repeating portion of
the decimal expansion was left unrecorded (even if this repeating portion was all zeroes).
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases. For each test case there is one line of input of the form 0.dddd . . . where
dddd is a string of 1 to 9 digits, not all zero. A line containing 0 follows the last case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output the original fraction.

Note that an exact decimal fraction has two repeating expansions (e.g. 1/5 = 0.2000 . . . = 0.19999 . . .).

```

## Sample Output

```text
0.2...
0.20...
0.474612399...
0

```
