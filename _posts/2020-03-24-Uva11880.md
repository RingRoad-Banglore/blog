title: Uva 11880  Ball in a Rectangle
---


## Input

```text
There is a rectangle on the cartesian plane, with bottom-left corner at (0,0) and top-right corner at
(L,W ). There is a ball centered at (x, y), with radius=R, shown below

At time 0, the ball starts to move along a ray with polar angle a (the angle from positive x-axis
to the ray, rotating counter-clockwise). When hitting the rectangle boundary, the reflex angle always
equals to the incidence angle. The balls velocity is always v (i.e. it never changes when hitting the
rectangle). Where is the center of the ball at time s?
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 25 test cases, each contains a line with 8 integers L,W ,x,y,R,a,v,s (100  L,W 
109, 1  R  5, R  x  L R, R  y  W  R, 0  a < 360, 1  v, s  109), as stated above. The
input terminates with L = W = x = y = R = a = v = s = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing two floating-point numbers x, y, rounded to two decimal
points, indicating that the center of ball will be at (x, y) at time s.

```

110 100 70 10 5 180 1 9999
