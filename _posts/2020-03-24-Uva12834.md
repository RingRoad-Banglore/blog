## Input

```

Kana Shamsu is a frightening local terror. There areN business places in his area. He (Kana Shamsu)
claims extortion to the business owners to continue their business, otherwise they will suffer. Shamsu is
a dangerous man. There is a rumor that Shamsu can kill people for money. The total business society
is feeling unsafe. It comes as an unexpected disaster.

But Shamsu has his own boss too. He works under a very
powerful godfather named Vuri Kamal. Kamal is a very busy
person, as he needs to manage lots of local terror like Shamsu.
So he (Kamal) doesnt want to know how much money Shamsu
can receive from the business owner. He claims Shamsu to give
him some specific amount of money Xi for those business places
(where i = 0 to N 1). On the other hand, business owners want
to make an agreement with Shamsu for the donation amount Yi
for each business (where i = 0 to N  1).

So it comes to a situation that, for each business place i (0 
i < N) Shamsu gets Yi from the business owner and needs to
give the Kamal Xi. Meanwhile Shamsu realizes that, for some
business places, his godfather Mr. Vuri Kamal claims more than
he can manage from that place. To some extent, Vuri Kamal
gives Shamsu a chance to deny collecting money from at most K

places. So now Shamsu needs to find a process to maximize his profit he can gain from these N business
places.
