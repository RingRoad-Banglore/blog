## Input

```

Cube Factory Ltd is an enterprise that sells hcubes (short of harmonic cubes), a very fashionable
item nowadays providing great profits for his owner, Mr. Tesseract (his friends call him Mr.T).

Mr. T just bought a very large space to fit his increasing stock of hcubes. Hcubes have a plain cube
format and are not hard to stock. However, Mr. T has a (rather harmless?) mania: he only admits
two valid ways to pile them: (a) in cube format or (b) in squared pyramids (i.e., where each new step
holds an increasing square number of elements).

One example of each type (holding, respectively, 43 = 64 hcubes and 12+22+32+42 = 30 hcubes):

Given N hcubes, find the minimal number of valid piles to stock them according to Mr. T rules.
Example: to stock 38 hcubes we only need two piles: e.g., one cube of height 2 (holding 8 hcubes)

and a pyramid of height 4 (holding 30 hcubes).
