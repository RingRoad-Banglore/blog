## Input

```
SOHA and TARA are playing Game of Blocks. Game of Blocks is a
two player game played on a 4 4 board. At the start of the game, each
cell contains a piece colored red or blue. The two players make moves
alternately - SOHA, being player 1, makes the first move. In each move,
a player chooses a colored cell (that is a cell with a blue or a red piece in
it). After making a move, all the reachable cells from that selected cell
vanishes. Two cells are reachable if you can start from one and end on the
other by making moves in the direction up, down, left or right and all the
pieces in the path has the same color. After each move, all the pieces will
come down to fill the empty spaces.

Consider an initial grid shown above. The blue pieces have white cen-
ters to differentiate them from the red pieces in order to facilitate the colored blind people.

Say, SOHA makes a move by selecting the cell at row 2 and column 3 or in other words cell (2, 3).
The diagrams below shows what happens to the pieces after the move is made.

The player to remove the last piece wins the game. If both of the players play perfectly, can you
determine whether SOHA will be able to win the game? If a player can win, (s)he will try to finish the
game in minimum number of moves possible. However, if a player finds (s)he has no way to win, (s)he
will make moves in order to delay the game as long as possible.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T  1000) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
consists of 4 lines with 4 characters in each. The characters are B or R to indicate blue and red pieces
respectively. There is a blank line after each case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the case number first. If SOHA can win the game, print win X, otherwise print
loss X where X indicates the total number of moves before all the pieces vanishes.
