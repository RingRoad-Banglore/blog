## Input

```

You are taking care of Emily this afternoon. To keep her entertained, youve designed a game for her
involving some math. The rule for the game is such  Emily is initially given a big number N . In each
step she is supposed to:

1. If N is 0, stop and call it a day

2. If N is divisible by 2, divide N by 2.

3. Otherwise, subtract 1 from N .

For example, starting with 14, she gets 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 0

Now, you see, Emily is just a kid and hasnt grown strong notions of rules yet. So, as you have
given the rules to her, Emily tries, but misunderstands. In her mind, she rewrites the rules :

1. If N is 0, stop and call it a day

2. If N is divisible by 2, divide N by 2.

3. Randomly and unbiasedly choose to do any of these two :

 subtract 1 from N

 add 1 with N

For each division Emily takes d seconds, For each subtraction she takes s seconds, for each addition
she takes a seconds. Now that you know how she is bending the rules, you start to wonder how many
seconds you have to see Emily play.

## Output

```
First line of input will contain the number of test cases, T  100000. Then T test cases follow. For
each case there will be a single line containing four integers separated by space:

N d s a

where ,

 1  N  1000000

 1  d, s, a  10

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case output a single line containing one real number, the expected number of seconds: T .
Show exactly 3 digits after decimal point, properly rounded.
