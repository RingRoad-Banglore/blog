title: Uva 12720  Algorithm of Phil
---


```

Phil is learning a new algorithm which wasnt taught in his algorithms classes. However, he is not sure
whether he implemented it the right way, so he would really appreciate if you could implement it so
that he can compare the outputs.

The algorithm starts with a binary string A and an empty string S. The algorithm consists of
multiple steps. In each step, A and S are modified as follows:

 If the number of bits in A is odd, then the middle bit of A is added to the end of S and removed
from A.

 If the number of bits in A is even, then both middle bits of A are compared. The bigger one
(anyone in case of a tie) is added to the end of S and removed from A.

 If after some step the string A gets empty, the algorithm terminates. The algorithms return is
the decimal representation of the number represented by S.

A bit a is bigger than a bit b if a is 1 and b is 0.

## Input

```
The first line contains T (T  500)  the number of test cases, after this line T test cases follows. Each
test case consists of one line containing a binary string A (1  |A|  105), representing the algorithms
input.

```

## Output

```
For each case print a line containing Case #X: Y , where X is the case number, starting at 1, and
Y is the algorithms return for the given input, modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
