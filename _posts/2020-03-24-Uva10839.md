title: Uva 10839  The Curse of Barbosa
---


## Input

```text
Fate it seems is never without a twist for our beloved pirate
Captain Jack Sparrow. He had just beaten the infamous
Captain Barbosa and got his ship the Black Pearl back.
But now that he is about to set sails to conquer all that
once belonged to him, he noticed that he is yet to remove
one last curse, the curse of Barbosa.

Barbosas curse said that Jack would remain stuck
within three islands (we must not utter the names, or we
will be cursed, too). We call the islands island 1, 2 and 3.
Jack would have to start from a particular island, island
1, and get back to it after visiting all these three islands
a given number of times. For example if Barbosas curse
said that Jack has to visit every island 2 times, one way to do that would be: 1-2-3-1-2-3-1. As you
would notice, the island 1 comes three times because you would have to start from there. What makes
Barbosas curse even more interesting is that Jack is not allowed to visit the islands in a reverse route
if he had already visited them in one route. For example if Jack took the 1-3-2-1-3-2-1 route, Jack is
not allowed to take the 1-2-3-1-2-3-1 route. Barbosa has also made sure that Jack cannot stay in the
same island and call it a visit, so trips like 1-2-2-3-1-3-1 are not allowed.

But we all know that for every curse there has to be a way to undone it. And fortunately for Jack
this curse can be removed without making a single trip through the islands. All Jack has to do is: given
the number of total visits, he has to count the number of different ways one can make the trips through
these three islands.

Jack is a pirate you know. He is smart in his pirate way, but he is certainly not a Computer geek.
He is hoping that there are some who would read his story and write a program to remove the curse of
Barbosa.

## Output

```text
The first line starts with the number of test cases, T (T  40). Each of the next T lines contains a
single integer N (N  100). Here N is the total number of island visits that Jack has to make. You
can assume that N will always be of form 3 M + 1, where M is the number of times Jack has to visit
island 1, 2 and 3. All trips start from island 1, hence we have the added 1 in the 3M + 1 form.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each of the test case print one line of output. The output for each test case starts with the test
case number, followed by the number of different ways one can visit the three islands. You can assume
that the output for each test case will take at most 40 characters.
