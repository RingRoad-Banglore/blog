## Input

```

Given 2 permutations of integers from 1 to N , you need to find the minimum number of operations
necessary to change both or any one of them in such a way that they become exactly same. Here only
two operations are allowed: either you can delete an integer from any position or you can insert an
integer into any position, but replacing one integer by another one is not allowed.

Say, N = 5 and the permutations are {1, 3, 5, 4, 2} and {1, 5, 4, 3, 2}. Then we need just 2
operations: we need to delete 3 from the 2nd position and insert it in the 4th position of the first
permutation, or we can delete 3 from both the permutations, which also needs two operations.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T  40). Each of the following T cases contains 3
lines for each case: the 1st line contains a single integer N (1  N  200, 000) and the next two lines
contain the two permutations of the integers.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print a line of the form Case < x >: < y >, where x is the case number and y is the
number of operations necessary to covert the 1st permutation to the 2nd permutation.

```

## Sample Output

```
2

5

1 3 5 4 2

1 5 4 3 2

4

1 2 4 3

3 4 2 1

```
