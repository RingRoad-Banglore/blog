title: Uva 12547  RNA Secondary Structure
---


## Input

```

RNA, which stands for Ribonucleic Acid, is one of the major macromolecules that are essential for all
known forms of life. It is made up of a long chain of components called nucleotides. Each component
is made up of one of 4 bases and are represented using A, C, G or U. The primary structure of RNA is
a sequence of these characters. The secondary structure of RNA refers to the base pairing interactions
between different components. More specifically, base A can pair up with base U and base C can pair up
with base G. The stability of the RNA secondary structure depends on the total number of base pairs
that can be formed. The final structure is the one that contains the maximum number of base pairs.

Lets represent the primary structure as a string consisting of characters from the set (ACGU). The
rules of secondary structure formation are as follows:

1. Any base A can form a pair with any base U

2. Any base C can form a pair with any base G

3. Each base can be part of at most one pair.

4. Lets assume w < x, y < z and w < y. If base at index w forms a pair with base at index x and
base at index y forms a pair with base at index z, then one of the following two conditions must
be true:

y > x

z < x

5. There can be at most K pairs between C and G.

You will be given the primary structure of the RNA of a certain species and your job is to figure out
the total number of base pairings in the final secondary structure based on the constraints mentioned
above.

You will be given the primary structure in a compressed format that uses run-length encod-
ing. In this type of data compression, consecutive characters having the same value is replaced
with a single character followed by its frequency. For example, AAAACCGAAUUG will be repre-
sented using A4C2G1A2U2G1. That means the primary structure will be given in the format
< c1f1c2f2c3f3 . . . cnfn >, where ci is from the set (ACGU) and fi is a positive integer.

The species that we are dealing with have the following properties:

1. f1 + f2 + f3 + . . .+ fn  10050

2. f1  5000

3. fn  5000

4. f2 + f3 + f4 + . . .+ fn1  50
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T  200) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
contains two lines. The first line is the primary structure given in run-length encoded format. The
second line gives you the value of K (0  K  20), that gives an upper limit on the number of C G
base pairs that can be in the final secondary structure.
