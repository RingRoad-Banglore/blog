---


## Input

```text

Abir loves to eat. Every time he visits a restaurant he wants to eat a chicken
item. But chicken item may not be always available. In each day he visits
m restaurants consecutively. Each restaurant (i = 1, . . . ,m) can make ni
different items (Number of Chicken item is exactly 1). But in a single day
each restaurant prepares exactly ki items (chosen randomly from ni items).

Find expected number of chicken items Abir can eat in a single day.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 125), denoting the number of test cases.
Each case starts with a line containing an integer m (1  m  10000) which
denotes number of visiting restaurants. Then in the following line there will
be m pair of numbers ni and ki (1  i  m, 1  ni  20, 1  ki  ni).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print expected number of chicken items Abir can eat in a single line in the format P/Q,
where P and Q are relatively prime (i.e. no common factor > 1, between P and Q).

Explanation for Sample Case
In the first case, total no of item is one (one chicken item) and probability of getting 1 chicken item

is one. So expected number of chicken item is 1.
In the second case, probability of getting 1 chicken item is 1/2 and probability of getting 2 chicken

items is 1/4. So expected no of chicken item is 1 1/2 + 2 1/4 = 2/2 = 1/1.
