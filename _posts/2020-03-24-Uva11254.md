title: Uva 11254  Consecutive Integers
---


## Input

```
Any positive integer can be written as the sum of several consecutive integers. For example,

15 = 1 + . . .+ 5 = 4 + . . .+ 6 = 7 + . . .+ 8 = 15 + . . .+ 15

Given a positive integer n, what are the consecutive positive integers with sum being n? If there
are multiple solutions, which one consists of more numbers?
```

## Output

```
Input consists of multiple problem instances. Each instance consists of a single positive integer n, where
n  109. The input data is terminated by a line containing -1. There will be at most 1000 test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input integer n, print out the desired solution with the format:

N = A + ... + B

in a single line. (Read sample output for a clearer representation of the exact formatting.)

```

## Sample Output

```
8
15
35
-1

```
