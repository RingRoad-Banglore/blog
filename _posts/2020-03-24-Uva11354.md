title: Uva 11354  Bond
---


```
Once again, James Bond is on his way to saving the world. Bonds latest mission requires him to travel
between several pairs of cities in a certain country.

The country has N cities (numbered by 1, 2, . . . , N), connected by M bidirectional roads. Bond is
going to steal a vehicle, and drive along the roads from city s to city t. The countrys police will be
patrolling the roads, looking for Bond, however, not all roads get the same degree of attention from the
police.

More formally, for each road MI6 has estimated its dangerousness, the higher it is, the more likely
Bond is going to be caught while driving on this road. Dangerousness of a path from s to t is defined
as the maximum dangerousness of any road on this path.

Now, its your job to help Bond succeed in saving the world by finding the least dangerous paths
for his mission.

## Input

```
There will be at most 5 cases in the input file.

The first line of each case contains two integers N , M (2  N  50000, 1  M  100000)  number
of cities and roads. The next M lines describe the roads. The i-th of these lines contains three integers:
xi, yi, di (1  xi, yi  N, 0  di  109)  the numbers of the cities connected by the i-th road and its
dangerousness.

Description of the roads is followed by a line containing an integer Q (1  Q  50000), followed by
Q lines, the i-th of which contains two integers si and ti (1  si, ti  N, si = ti).

Consecutive input sets are separated by a blank line.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output Q lines, the i-th of which contains the minimum dangerousness of a path between
cities si and ti. Consecutive output blocks are separated by a blank line.

The input file will be such that there will always be at least one valid path.
