title: Uva 10920  Spiral Tap
---


## Input

```
The game of Spiral Tap is played on a square grid. Pieces are
placed on a grid and the moves are realized according to the
position of the pieces on the grid. However, the coordinate system
in the game of Spiral Tap are a bit different that those find in
traditional board games, such as chess.

The cell numbering scheme follow a spiral, starting from the
center of the grid in an anti-clockwise fashion. The figure on the
right illustrates the cell numbering scheme.

The goal is, given the spiral tap coordinates of a cell, find its
cartesian coordinates (line 1 is at the bottom, and column 1 is
the leftmost).
```

## Output

```
The input is a series of lines. Each line is composed of two numbers: SZ and P . SZ is the size of the
border of the grid and is an odd number no larger than 100000. P is the spiral position of a cell in this
grid. The line such that SZ = P = 0 marks the end of the input (and is not part of the data set).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line in the data set of the input, your program must echo a line Line = X, column = Y .,
where X and Y are the cartesian coordinates of the corresponding cell.

## Sample Output

3 1
3 3
3 9
5 9
5 10
0 0
