title: Uva 01219  Team Arrangement

## Input

```text

Barry Bennett, the coach of the Bings football team, wants to arrange his team for an important match
against the Bangs. He decides on the formation he wants to play, for example 4-4-2, meaning that there
will be four defenders, four midfielders, and two strikers (and of course, one goalkeeper). Your task is to
determine the players who will play. For each available player, we know his role (e.g. midfielder). For
each role, the players are selected in ascending order of their numbers. When the players are selected,
you must determine the captain too, who is the player with the longest record in the team play. In
case two players have the same record, the one with bigger number is chosen. Note that the captain is
chosen among the players that are selected in the arrange.

## Output

```text
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first 22 lines of each test case contain the data for the 22
available players in this format:

number name role year1  year1 year2  year

2 . . .

number is the player number (unique positive integer less than 100). name is a string of at most 20
letters. role is a single character among G, D, M, S, for goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and striker
respectively. Each yeari  yeari pair (yeari  year


i) shows the player has been a member of the team

between the specified years (inclusive). The years are in four-digit format. There is at least one and at
most 20 such pairs, and the same year is not repeated more than once in the list. There is a 23-rd line
describing the desired formation, like 4-4-2 in that format. Note that there are only three numbers in
the formation (so, 4-3-2-1 is not valid), none of them is zero, and their sum is always 10. The input is
terminated by a line containing a single 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a list of 11 players chosen in the arrange. Each line must contain the player
number, his name and his role, separated by single blank characters. The players must be sorted
according to their role, in the order of goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and strikers. The players
with the same role are sorted according to ascending order of their numbers. There is an exception
that the captain always comes as the first player in the entire list. If it is not possible to arrange the
team conforming to the desired formation, write a single line containing IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRANGE in
the output. There should be a blank line after the output for each test case.
