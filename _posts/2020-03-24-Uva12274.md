title: Uva 12274  Jumping monkey

## Input

```text
You are a hunter chasing a monkey in the forest, trying to shoot it down with your all-powerful automatic
machine gun. The monkey is hiding somewhere behind the branches of one of the trees, out of your
sight. You can aim at one of the trees and shoot; your bullets are capable of going through the branches
and killing the monkey instantly if it happens to be in that tree. If it isnt, the monkey takes advantage
of the time it takes you to reload and takes a leap into a neighbouring tree without you noticing. It
never stays in the same place after a shot. You would like to find out whether there is an strategy that
allows you to capture the monkey for sure, irrespective of its initial location and subsequent jumps. If
so, you need to determine the shortest sequence of shots guaranteeing this.

Figure 2

As an example, consider the situation in which there are only two neighboring trees in the forest
(left hand side of Figure 2). It is then possible to make sure you capture the monkey by shooting
twice at the same tree. Your first shot succeeds if the monkey happened to be there in the first place.
Otherwise, the monkey was behind the other tree and it will necessarily have moved when you shoot
for the second time.

However, depending on the shape of the forest it may not be possible for you to ensure victory. One
example of this is if there are three trees, all connected to one another (right hand side of Figure 2). No
matter where you aim at, there are always two possible locations for the monkey at any given moment.
(Note that here we are concerned with the worst-case scenario where the monkey may consistently guess
your next target tree).
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases, separated by single blank lines. Each test case begins with a
line containing two integers n and m (1  n  21); n is the number of trees in the forest, and m is
the number of adjacency relations between trees. Each of the following m lines contains two distinct
integers between 0 and n  1 (inclusive), the identifiers of the trees in an adjacent pair. The order of
both trees within a pair carries no meaning, and no pair appears more than once. You may further
assume that no tree is adjacent to itself, and there is always a path between any two trees in the forest.

The test cases will finish with a line containing only two zeros (also preceded with a blank line).

```

## Sample Input

```text
Print a line for each test case. The line should contain the single word Impossible if the task is
impossible. Otherwise, it must contain the shortest sequence of shots with the required property, in
the format L: V1V2 . . . VL, where L is the length of the sequence, and V1, V2, . . . , VL are space-separated

integers containing the identifiers of the trees to shoot at in the right order. If several shortest sequences
exist, print the lexicographically smallest one. (A sequence is smaller than another in lexicographic order
if the first element on which they differ is smaller in the first one).
