## Input

```text

Unfortunately, this is not a Magic Eye

Alien DNA is more complicated than
human DNA. For example, rather
than viewing an alien DNA strand as
a sequence of base pairs, it can be
viewed as a sequence of base sets. A
base set is, simply put, a string of low-
ercase letters where each letter repre-
sents a different base. Note that hu-
man DNA is also a sequence of base
sets, except a base set is simply a pair-
ing of a with t or c with g.

Since alien DNA is more compli-
cated than human DNA, the algo-
rithms used in alien bioinformatics are
also much more complicated. How-
ever, you have only been working at
AlienBioTechNextGenCorp for three
days and are not yet trusted enough
to handle the complicated tasks.

Your first job is simple. You must
develop software to cut a strand of alien DNA into as few segments as possible. The only constraint is
that base sets of a given segment must share at least one common base.

## Output

```text
Input begins with an integer t  100, the number of test cases to be processed. Each test case begins
with a single value n (1  n  10, 000) representing the length of the alien DNA strand. Each of the
n following lines consists of a single string of lowercase letters representing a base set. Each string will
contain at least one character, and no repeated characters. The base sets are given in the input in the
same order they appear on the DNA strand.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the minimum number of cuts required to partition the strand into segments
that share a common base.
