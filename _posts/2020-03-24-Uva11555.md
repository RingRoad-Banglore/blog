## Input

```text
Phew, that was the last one! exclaimed the garden helper Tim as he threw
the last tree plant to the ground. His employer, countess Esmeralda Hunt
who owned the estate, has ordered him to arrange an avenue of aspen trees
along both sides of the front road leading up to the house. The first trees
in the avenue are supposed to be planted at the very beginning of the road,
and the last trees of the avenue at the very end of the road. Tim, who was
constantly being reminded of her sense of accuracy, knew that the countess
would insist on the trees being placed in perfectly aligned tree pairs, one on
each side of the road, and with exactly the same spacing between the pairs
along the road. However, when bringing the tree plants to the estate, Tim
had just dropped them arbitrarily along the left side of the road and was
now facing the task of moving the trees to their correct positions to meet the
countesss requirements. Being stronger in mind than in arms, and since it was time for a coffee break
anyway before he started digging, he sat down to figure out which trees to move to which positions so
as to minimize the total (Euclidean) distance that he had to move the trees.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The input starts with a positive even integer N between 4 and 2000 (inclusive), giving the total
number of trees in the avenue. The next line contains two integers L and W , where 1  L  10000 is
the length of the road, in meters, and 1  W  20 is the width of the road, in meters. The next N
lines each describe where Tim had dropped of the trees. Each such line contains an integer 0  p  L
indicating the position of a tree plant along the left side of the road, measured in meters from the start
of the road.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, write to the output the smallest total number of meters the tree plants need to be
moved, on a line by itself. The answer should be given with an absolute or relative error of at most
106.
