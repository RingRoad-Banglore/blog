title: Uva 12602  Nice Licence Plates
---


```
Alberta licence plates currently have a format of
ABC-0123 (three letters followed by four digits).

We say that the licence plate is nice if the abso-
lute difference between the value of the first part and
the value of the second part is at most 100.

The value of the first part is calculated as the
value of base-26 number (where digits are in [A..Z]).
For instance, if the first part is ABC, its value is 28
(0  262 +1  261 +2  260). So, the plate ABC-0123
is nice, because |28 123|  100.

Given the list of licence plate numbers, your pro-
gram should determine if the plate is nice or not.
