title: Uva 12615  Fantastic Network
---


## Input

```
An undirected weighted graph G = (V,E) is defined as a Fantastic network if it has the following
properties:

1. The graph is connected.

2. The degree of any node is at most 6.

3. It may or may not contain cycles, but the length of any cycle (if exists) in this network will be
3. The nodes which are part of at least one cycle are called fine nodes.

4. The degree of any fine node can be at most 3.

Here, cycle is defined as a path < v0, v1, . . . , vk > in any graph such that the following statements
hold:

1. k  3. (k is the length of the cycle)

2. v0 = vk.

3. For each i (0  i < K) vi and vi+1 are connected by an edge.

4. v1, . . . , vk are distinct.

An edge dominating set for an undirected graph G = (V,E) is a subset F of E such that every
edge not included in F is adjacent to (i.e. shares a vertex with) some edge in F . The weight of an edge
dominating set is the sum of the weights of all edges in that set. Given a Fantastic network with
positive edge weights, you need to determine the weight of the minimum weight edge dominating
set.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T  100). The first line of each of the T cases
contains two integers N (2  N  5000) and M (1  M  2  N), representing the number of nodes
and edges, respectively, in a Fantastic network. Each of the following M lines contains 3 integers ui,
vi, wi, which means there is an edge from ui to vi (1  ui, vi  n) with weight wi (1  wi  10000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print a line of the form Case x: y, where x is the case number and y is the weight of
minimum weight edge dominating set of the given Fantastic network.
