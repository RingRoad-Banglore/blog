title: Uva 11762  Race to 1
---


## Input

```text
Dilu have learned a new thing about integers, which is - any positive integer greater than 1 can be
divided by at least one prime number less than or equal to that number. So, he is now playing with
this property. He selects a number N . And he calls this D.

In each turn he randomly chooses a prime number less than or equal to D. If D is divisible by the
prime number then he divides D by the prime number to obtain new D. Otherwise he keeps the old
D. He repeats this procedure until D becomes 1. What is the expected number of moves required for
N to become 1.

[We say that an integer is said to be prime if its divisible by exactly two different integers. So, 1 is not
a prime, by definition. List of first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...]
```

## Output

```text
Input will start with an integer T (T  1000), which indicates the number of test cases. Each of the
next T lines will contain one integer N (1  N  1000000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a single line giving the case number followed by the expected number of turn
required. Errors up to 1e-6 will be accepted.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
1
3
13

```
