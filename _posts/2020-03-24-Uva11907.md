title: Uva 11907  Collision of Bacteria
---


## Input

```text
An experiment is being conducted to find out how different colonies
of bacteria behave when they collide with each other. The individual
colonies are placed on a large dish and the dish can be modeled in a 2D
plane. Initially, each colony occupies a rectangular area (sides parallel
to axis) and the sizes of these colonies grow with time. The growth of
the colonies occurs in the following manner:

1. The x and y coordinate of the lower-left corner decrease.

2. The x coordinate of lower-right corner increases and the y coor-
dinate decreases.

3. The x and y coordinate of upper-right corner increase.

4. The x coordinate of upper-left corner decreases and the y coordinate increases.

All the increments/decrements mentioned above occur at a constant rate r with respect to time. In
this problem, you have to determine the smallest unit of time that elapses when there are at least two
colonies that are not more than d distance apart. Here the distance refers to the shortest Euclidean
distance between the rectangular areas occupied by the colonies.

## Output

```text
The first line of input will contain T ( 100) denoting the number of cases.
Each case starts with an integer n (2  n  50) denoting the number of colonies. Each of the next

n lines contains 4 integers x1 y1 x2 y2 (0  x1, y1, x2, y2  10000, x1 < x2, y1 < y2) where (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2) denote the lower-left and upper-right corner of the colony respectively. Next line contains two
integers, r and d (1  r, d  50).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number and the desired result rounded to 3 places after the decimal point.
If two colonies overlap or just touch each other, they are considered to be zero distance apart.
