```
In how many ways can you choose k elements out of n elements, not taking order into account?

Write a program to compute this number.
```

## Input

```
The input file will contain one or more test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n (n  1) and k (0  k  n).
Input is terminated by two zeroes for n and k.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print one line containing the required number. This number will always fit into an
integer, i.e. it will be less than 231.

Warning: Dont underestimate the problem. The result will fit into an integer  but if all intermediate
results arising during the computation will also fit into an integer depends on your algorithm. The test
cases will go to the limit.

```

## Sample Input

```
4 2
10 5
49 6
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
6
252
13983816
