## Input

```text
Gan Jiang was one of Yu Zhous friends but worked for Cao Cao. One day Gan Jiang visited Yu Zhous
army and would like to steal something from Yu Zhous army in the midnight. Yu Zhou invited him to
stay for the whole night and set up guards.

Figure: 3rd sample

Gan Jiang saw there are N forts numbered 0, 1, 2,   , n  1 in Yu
Zhous army, the guards are connecting the neighbours forts, including (0, 1),
(1, 2)    (n 2, n 1), (n 1, 0) to form a simple polygon. Gan Jiang was in
the fort 0 only allowed to walk towards the higher numbered forts in straight
line. He was not allowed to go inside of the polygon even pass by other
vertices, but he can go along the edges of the polygon, e.g, go from fort 2 to
fort 3. When Gan Jiang arrived a fort, he could steal letters of value Vi. But
walking makes him unhappy and for each unit length walking, he will get 1
unit of unhappiness, Gan Jiang could end this mission at any time and ride
a horse back to Cao Cao.

Gan Jiang would like to make the total value of letters as big as possible,
but make the unhappiness as low as possible. So his target is to make the
total value of letters minus total unhappiness as big as possible. Help Gan
Jiang to get it.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T (1  10). T test cases follow. Each test
case starts with an integer N (1  N  1000. Each of the next N lines consists of 3 float numbers
with 4 digits after decimal point, xi, yi (105  xi, yi  105), Vi (0  Vi  105), (xi, yi) represents the
coordinate of fort i and Vi represents the value of the letters in for i.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting
from 1) and y is the maximal value of total value of letters minus total unhappiness. y will be considered
correct if it is within an absolute or relative error of 104 of the correct answer.
