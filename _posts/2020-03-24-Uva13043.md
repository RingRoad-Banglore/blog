title: Uva 13043  Marbles
---


```
How many different ways you can distribute  N (distinguishable) marbles into  K boxes where each
box should contain at least  X marbles? Two distributions are considered different if there is at least
one marble which is contained by different boxes in the distributions.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input contains  T (1  T  50) which is the number of test cases. Each of the following
 T lines contains three space separated integers  N , K  and  X (1  X  N  100000  and 1  K  50).

```

## Output

```
Output the case number, followed by the required quantity. Output the result modulo 1000000007 .

Note: For the 1st case the possible distributions are (the i-th element is the box number for the i-th
marble) : {1,1,2,2}, {1,2,1,2}, {1,2,2,1}, {2,2,1,1}, {2,1,2,1}, {2,1,1,2}.

```

## Sample Input

4 2 2
10 5 3
900 5 20

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 6
Case 2: 0
Case 3: 76094425
