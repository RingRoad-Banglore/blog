## Input

```
Building and maintaining roads among communities in the far North is an expensive business. With
this in mind, the roads are built in such a way that there is only one route from a village to a village
that does not pass through some other village twice.

Given is an area in the far North comprising a number of villages and roads among them such that
any village can be reached by road from any other village. Your job is to find the road distance between
the two most remote villages in the area.

The area has up to 10,000 villages connected by road segments. The villages are numbered from 1.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several sets of input. Each set of input is a sequence of lines, each containing three
positive integers: the number of a village, the number of a different village, and the length of the road
segment connecting the villages in kilometers. All road segments are two-way. Two consecutive sets are
separated by a blank line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input, you are to output a single line containing a single integer: the road distance
between the two most remote villages in the area.
