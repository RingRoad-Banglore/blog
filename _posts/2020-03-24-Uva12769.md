The city council of the capitol city is interested in increasing
the size of the buildings along their main street to attract
more businesses, but they are worried that if they build too
fast, they may run out of money, so they want to build their
city in multiple phases.

Assume that the street is n units long and the buildings
are one unit wide. In each phase, the council will choose
two endpoints (1  a  b  100, 000) and increase the
height of every building in between a and b (inclusively) by
y units. For example, here is the sky-line of a city before
and after the change: a = 2, b = 10, y = 1 (The numbers
below the road are for your sanity).

Keeping track of the heights of the buildings can be rather tricky over time, so we need your help.
```

## Input

```
Input file contains at most 8 (eight) test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer T on the
first line, the number of instructions. Each of the following T (T  100, 000) lines will be in one of the
following two formats:

 B a b y : Building instruction  Increase the height of the buildings between a and b by y
units.

 Q a: Query line  Output the height of building a at this point.

Input lines are always valid, i.e., 1  a  b  100, 000. The value of y is a positive integer, at most
1,000. You can assume that the main street is completely flat before the first phase, i.e., height is zero
for every building i in [1, 100000]. Input is terminated by a case where the value of T is zero.

```

## Output

```
For each query line of each test case, output the height of the specified building on a separate line.
