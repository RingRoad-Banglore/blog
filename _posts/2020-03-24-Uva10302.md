## Input

```
The following text was taken from a book of mathematics:

The antidifference of a function f(x) is the function g(x) such that f(x) = g(x+ 1) g(x). So, if we
have a summation of f(x), it can be simplified by the use of its antidifference in the following way:

f(k) + f(k + 1) + f(k + 2) + . . .+ f(k + n) =

= g(k + 1) g(k) + g(k + 2) g(k + 1) + g(k + 3) g(k + 2)+ . . . +g(k + n+ 1) g(k + n) =
= g(k + n+ 1) g(k)

A factorial polynomial is expressed as k{n} meaning the following expression:

k  (k  1)  (k  2)  . . .  (k  (n 1))

The antidifference of a factorial polynomial k{n} is k{n+1}/(n+ 1).

So, if you want to calculate Sn = p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+ . . .+p(n), where p(i) is a polynomial of degree
k, we can express p(i) as a sum of various factorial polynomials and then, find out the antidifference
P (i). So, we have Sn = P (n+ 1) P (1).

Example:

S = 23+35+47+59+611+ . . .+(n+1) (2n+1) = p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+p(4)+p(5)+ ...+p(n),

where p(i) = (i+ 1)(2i+ 1).

Expressing p(i) as a factorial polynomial, we have:

p(i) = 2i{2} + 5i+ 1.

and then
P (i) = (2/3)i{3} + (5/2)i{2} + i.

Calculating P (n+ 1) P (1) we have

S = (n/6)  (4n2 + 15n+ 17)

Given a number 1  x  50, 000, one per line of input, calculate the following summation:

1 + 8 + 27 + ...+ x3
```

## Output

```
Input file contains several lines of input. Each line contain a single number which denotes the value of
x. Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output which is the desired summation value.
