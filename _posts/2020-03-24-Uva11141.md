title: Uva 11141  Sugar Cubes
---


```
Pezz likes to chew sugar cubes so much! Since he is fasting today, he wants to play with his N sugar
cubes instead of eating them! He assigned indices 1, 2, . . . , N to his cubes and also, he has written a
random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) on each side of these N sugar cubes. Now, he wants to
arrange the sugar cubes in a row from left to right according to the following rules: Let the sugar cubes
in a arrangement be s1, s2, . . . , sk, where 1  k  N . By si.left and si.right we mean the number
on the left side and the number of the right side of sugar cube si respectively. The arrangement must
have this property: s1.left  s1.right  s2.left  s2.right  . . .  sk.left  sk.right. In addition, all
the cubes having number x in the arrangement (i.e. x is on the left side or right side of them in the
arrangement) should come in increasing sequence of their indices. For clarification, see figures below.

a valid arrangement

an invalid arrangement

Number of each side in a given
lump.

Now Pezz is curious about knowing how many arrange-
ments with the above rules exist. Note that two arrange-
ments are different if their sequences of indices from left to
right are distinct or the sequences of numbers on the left side
and right side of cubes in the arrangements from left to right,
i.e. s1.left, s1.right, s2.left, s2.right, . . . , sk.left, sk.right, are
distinct.

## Input

```
The input starts with a single integer T showing the number of
test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer
0 < N  200. Next, there will be N lines of exactly 6 integers denoting the written number on each
side of a sugar cube respectively (number i in figure above shows the place of i-th number).

There will one blank line after each test case.

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line containing the number of different ways that Pezz can arrange sugar
cubes modulo 1000000000 in a row, using the above rules.
