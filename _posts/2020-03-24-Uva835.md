## Input

```
Figure 1 shows a square. Each row, each column and the two diagonals can be read as a five digit prime
number. Both diagonals are read from left to right.

1 1 3 5 1
3 3 2 0 3
3 0 3 2 3
1 4 0 3 3
3 3 3 1 1

Figure 1 - Example square of primes.

Using the data in the input file, write a program that constructs such squares.

 The prime numbers must have the same digit sum (11 in the example).

 The digit in the top left-hand corner of the squares is pre-determined (1 in the example).

 A prime number may be used more than once in the same square.

 If there are several solutions, all must be present.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The input file contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer which is the digit sum of
the prime numbers. The second contains the digit in the top left corner of the square.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

In the output, write five lines for each solution found, where each line in turn consists of a five digit
prime number. The solutions must be in ascending order, separated by an empty line. (the above
example has three solutions)
