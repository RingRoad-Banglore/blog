```
Alice and Bob both have lots of candies but want more. They decide to play the following turn-based
game.

They fill an nn grid M with random integers. Alice begins the game by crossing off an uncrossed
row i of the grid. Now its Bob turn and he crosses off an uncrossed column j of the grid. At the
end of Bobs turn, Alice takes the number candies in the i-th row and j-th column of M , call this
value M(i, j), from Bob. (If M(i, j) is negative, then Alice gives |M(i, j)| candies to Bob.) The game
continues alternating turns from Alice to Bob until the entire board is crossed off.

What is the largest amount of candies that Alice can win from Bob (or least amount to lose if she
cannot win) if both Alice and Bob play optimally?

The beginning of a game between Alice (red) and Bob (blue).

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains an integer t (1  t  20), the number of test cases. Each test case
starts with n (1  n  8), the size of the grid. Then follow n lines containing n numbers separated by
spaces describing M . We call the j-th number on i-th line M(i, j) (1000  M(i, j)  1000).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the largest amount of candies that Alice can win from Bob. If she cannot win,
print the negative number indicating the minimum number of candies she loses.
