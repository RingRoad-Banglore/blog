## Input

```text
A travel company is planning to launch their bus service in a new route. So they conducted a survey
and made a list of all possible roads connecting different cities. Each of the roads has a certain amount
of income based on current fare. But at the same time, each road has some expenses too (this includes
fuel and maintenance cost, staff payments, taxes and tribute to labor union which is recently approved
by the Government). The travel company is looking for a cyclic route. That is, the bus will start from
any city, then visit one or more other cities each exactly once and return to the starting city. The
company is also concerned with the profit on the route. In fact the directors of the company have a
strict requirement of a profit ratio strictly greater than P . Otherwise they will not launch the service.
A profit ratio for a route is the ratio between the total income to the total expenses for that route. One
of your friends works in that company and he asks for a little help from you. All you have to do is to
determine if there exists such route, so that the company has a profit ratio of P .

## Output

```text
The first line of input is a positive integer T (T  100), the number of test cases. Then T test cases
will follow. Each of the test cases will start with 3 integers N , R, P (2  N  100, 0  R  9900,
1  P  100). N , R and P represents number of cities, number of road links and the expected profit
ratio. Then R lines will follow. Each line will contain 4 integers Ai, Bi, Ii, Ei (0  Ai, Bi < N ,
0  Ii  5000, 1  Ei  5000). (Ai, Bi) represents directed road link from city Ai to Bi. Ii and Ei are
the income and expenses of the road link respectively. Each test case will be followed by a blank line.
You may assume that (Ai, Bi) = (Aj , Bj), if i = j and Ai = Bi for any i.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line in the format Case k: s. Here k is the case number starting from
1 and s is a string either YES if there is a cyclic route for which the profit ratio is greater than P or
NO, if there is no such route. See the sample input output for details.

Note:
For the first case, consider the cycle 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1. Total income is 25(5 + 11 + 9) and total

expense is 8(3 + 1 + 4). Hence the profit ratio is 25/8 > 3.
