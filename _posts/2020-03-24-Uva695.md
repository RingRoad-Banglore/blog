## Input

```
In an old brainteaser you are given a set of digits and a set of operators and asked to arrange the digits
and the operators to form an expression that has a particular value. This problem is a variant of that
brainteaser.

In this problem you will be presented with a sequence of no more than ten digits (not necessarily
unique) with an imbedded equal sign, and a collection of at least one but no more than five integer
operators (from the set +, -, *, and /).

Your problem is to insert each of the operators between the correct pair of digits so the equation
thus formed is arithmetically correct, assuming all operators have the same precedence, and that each
side of the expression is evaluated strictly left to right. At least one digit will appear on each side of
the equal sign.

For example, you might be given 957 = 52 and the operators + and *. Arranging these in the
form 9  5+7 = 52 makes the equation correct. Or you might be given 123 = 456 and the operations
+, +, -, and *. If you arrange these in the form 1  2 + 3 = 4 5 + 6 youll find each side of the
equation has the value 5. As a final example consider 135 = 642 and the operators +, +, * and *.
The arrangement 1 + 3  5 = 6 + 4  2 makes each side of the equation have the value 20 (note the
strict left-to-right evaluation order on each side of the equation).

The division operator will yield only an integer result, and must obviously never be used with a
denominator of zero. No value in an expression will require more than six decimal digits. Each operator
must be used exactly once. The order in which the digits appear, and the placement of the equal sign
cannot be altered.
```

## Output

```
The input will consist of multiple test cases, each having two separate lines of input. On the first line
for each case there will appear the digits and the imbedded equal sign, starting in the first column. The
end of line will immediately follow the last digit. The second line will contain the operators to be used,
starting in column one with the end of line immediately following the last operator. The operators will
not be given in any particular order. The last test case will be followed by a line containing a dollar
sign ($) in column one.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case your are to display the case number (numbered sequentially starting with 1), a colon,
and the arithmetically correct expression with the operators shown in the proper positions. If there are
multiple correct answers, then any one of them will be acceptable. If there is no solution for a particular
case, display NO SOLUTION instead of the equation.

## Sample Output
