title: Uva 00649  You Who?

## Input

```text
On the first day of first grade at Friendly Elementrary School, it is customary for each student to spend
one minute talking to every classmate that he or she does not already know. When student Bob sees an
unfamilar face, he says You who? A typical response is Me Charlie, you who? Then Bob says, Me
Bob! and they talk for a minute. Its very cute. Then, after a minute, they part and each looks for
another stranger to greet. This takes time. In class of twenty-nine or thirty mutual strangers, it takes
29 minutes; time that, according to teachers, could be better spent learning the alphabet. Of course, it
is rare to have a first grade class where nobody knows anyone else; there are neighbors and playmates
who already know each other, so they dont have to go through the get-to-know-you minutes with each
other.

The two first grade teachers have requested that, to save time, students be allocated to their two
classes so that the difference in the sizes of the classes is at most one, and the time it takes to complete
these introductions is as small as possible. There are no more than 24 students in the incoming first
grade class.

How can the assignment of students to classes be made? Your job is to write the software that
answers the question.

## Output

```text
The input data consists of a number of test cases. Subsequent cases are separated by a single blank
line.

The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of a test case description contains one integer
N (1  N  24), denoting the total number students. Each of the next N lines contains the record
about one students friendships, represented as lists of numbers.

If there are N students, then they are represented by the numbers 1 to N . The record for a single
student includes, first, his/her student identification number (1 to N), then the number of his/her
acquaintances, then a list of them in no particular order. So, for example, this record

17 4 5 2 14 22

indicates that student 17 knows 4 students: 5, 2, 14 and 22.
The following test case

4
1 2 3 4
2 2 3 4
3 2 1 2
4 2 1 2

indicates that 1 doesnt know 2, and 3 doesnt know 4, but all other pairs know each other.
The input data has been checked for consistency, so that if A knows B, then B knows A.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

Your output for each case should contain three lines. In the first line there should be the maximal
number of introductions per person in the best possible legal class assignment. The second and third



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 649  You Who? 2/2

lines describe the two class enrollments that achieves that bound. An enrollment for each class is
represented by the number of students in the class, and then a list of the students in the class, in
increasing order separated by single spaces. If there is more than one such assignment, anyone will do.
