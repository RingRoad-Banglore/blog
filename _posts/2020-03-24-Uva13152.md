title: Uva 13152  Balanced String
---


## Input

```text
A string consisting of parenthesis ( and ) is called balanced string if any of the following is
true.

a. If the string is empty.

b. If A and B are balanced string, AB is also balanced string.

c. If A is a balanced string, (A) is also a balanced string

Now from a balanced string we can generate a sequence of numbers. The sequence is generated as
follows:

 Start scanning the string from left to right and after each scan print number of open paren-
thesis ( scanned so far - number of close parenthesis ) scanned so far (please note
the minus sign in between)

 After the sequence is generated it is rearranged randomly.

For example, suppose you have a balanced string = ( )( )
The sequence generated after the first step: 1 0 1 0
Sequence (one of many) after the rearrangement in the second step: 0 1 0 1

Your task is  given a sequence in random order, output the lexicographically smallest balanced
string if one exists, otherwise output invalid.

Note: ( is lexicographically smaller than ). Also remember the string you generate must produce
any sequence following above mentioned two steps which can be rearranged to match the sequence given
in the input.
```

## Output

```text
There will be T (1  T  11) test cases. For each test, the first line contains an integer N (1  N 
100000) where N denotes the number of integers in the sequence. The second line contains N integers
separated by spaces describing the sequence. You can assume all the inputs in the sequence will fit in
32 bit signed integer data type.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case you have to output the balanced string or invalid along with case number. There
should not be any intermediate spaces between brackets in the output. See the output format below
for more details.

```

## Sample Output

```text

4
0 0 1 1
