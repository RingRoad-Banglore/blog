title: Uva 11668  How Many Teams
---


```
University of Fixed Problems (UFP) was planning to
host a national level computer programming compe-
tition but just before the event they have realized
that they dont have a budget that is big enough for
a national programming contest!

On the eve of the contest, you get a phone call
from them and hear the inevitable  The Contest
is Called Off. However, they said they will be hosting
a General Knowledge competition instead.

The restriction on the number of teams goes like
this:

Your university can send a total of N con-
testants with K members in each team.
That means there are a total of N/K
teams.

A notice was sent to all departments of your university asking them to select their best students for
participating in this competition. Due to the limited number of seats, a department can send at most
3 members.

You managed to gather N students from various departments. Within this limited time, its not
going to be viable to come up with the best balanced teams. So you tell all these students to line up
randomly and assign first K students in one team, the next K students in another team and so on.
But, one rule that you are going to follow is that two person from the same department cannot be in
the same team. This will enable the teams to be more balanced.

Of the entire N ! (N Factorial) permutations of lining up, can you find out how many of those are
valid? A permutation is valid if you can assign the teams according to the rules mentioned above.

Example: Consider a case where N = 4 and K = 2.

PM-MATH, LT-CSE, DK-MATH, MMR-EEE

Suppose you have 4 students (PM, LT, DK and MMR) and their departments are (MATH, CSE,
MATH and EEE) respectively. You have to form 2 teams with 2 members in each team.

Some valid permutations are: (PM LT DK MMR) (LT PM DK MMR) (MMR PM LT DK).
And some invalid permutations are: (PM DK MMR LT) (LT MMR DK PM).
```

## Input

```
The first line is an integer T (T < 500) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case starts with
2 integers N (1  N  100) and K (1  K  10). It is guaranteed that N%K = 0. The next line
will contain N space separated strings of the format S1-D1 S2-D2 S3-D3 ... SN-DN . Si gives
you the names of each student and Di gives you the corresponding department of that student. All
the students names will be distinct. The department and student names will be alphanumeric and the
length of each will be at most 20.

## Output

```
For each case, output the case number followed by the total number of valid permutations. Since the
result could be very big, output the result modulo 1234.
