## Input

```text
Have you heard of Bob Woolmer, the former coach of South African cricket team? Unlike other
conventional coaches, Woolmer relies on his laptop computer for storing and analyzing information on
players, selecting team, planning match strategy etc. Since his laptop is his constant companion, people
call him Bob Laptop Woolmer.

Having seen Woolmer in action during World Cup 99, the BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) officials
sacked Gordon Abacus Greenidge (he was not willing to use computers) and decided to appoint someone
as charismatic as Woolmer for coaching Bangladesh cricket team. So, Eddie Barlow was appointed as
the new coach. They say that he is no less than Bob Woolmer with his computer. Then why dont you
ever see him with his laptop? That is because he doesnt have one! Actually, he has a desktop PC, and
he loves his computer so much that people call him Eddie Desktop Barlow.

Now, to select Bangladesh national team for the next World Cup, Barlow has asked BCB to call a
number of players to BKSP camp, so that he can minutely observe them before selection. Accordingly,
BCB invites around 100 players to join BKSP camp. Barlows strategy for selecting the best team is as
follows. He will observe each players batting, bowling and fielding capabilities individually, and each
player will have three individual scores in these three aspects (batting, bowling and fielding). He will
store each players scores in his hard disk. After he has scored all the players in this way, he will use
his computer to select the best combination. He believes that it is only his computer that can handle
this huge data and select the best combination to have the best capabilities in each department of the
game.

Barlow plans to have four specialist batsmen, three specialist bowlers, three all-rounders and one
wicket-keeper in the team. Since, Khaled Mashud has no competitor for the wicket keeping position,
this position is almost fixed. Barlow is now to decide for the rest 10 positions. For a specialist batsman,
batting capability is the most important, but he should have some fielding capability too; a specialist
bowler, besides bowling, should have some fielding and batting capabilities (since our bowlers need to
score runs in order to avoid making records(!)), and an all-rounder should have all the capabilities. So,
he sets the following rules:

For any player P

 If P is selected as a batsman, his EffectiveScore = 0.8 Battingscore+ 0.2  FieldingScore

 If P is selected as a bowler, his Effectivescore = 0.7 BowlingScore+0.10 BattingScore+0.2 
FieldingScore

 If P is selected as an all-rounder, his Effectivescore = 0.4 BattingScore+ 0.4 BowlingScore+
0.2  FieldingScore

All the effective scores should be rounded to the nearest integer for further calculation.
Barlow believes (and the mathematicians too will believe) that the best team will have the maximum

total effective score.

After the daylong practice session with the players, Barlow is to spend his nights with writing a
program that will select the best team. He wants his program to be a bit flexible. So, it will take the
number of candidate players, number of players to be selected, that is, number of batsmen, bowlers or
all-rounders as parameters. (But the rules are fixed). But, spending the whole night in programming,
he feels tired during the next day practice session, and cannot concentrate in his coaching or observing
the players.

So, BCB wants to relieve Barlow from this strenuous job, and hires you to do the job for Barlow.
Now you are to write the program for selecting the best team, according to the players scores assigned
by Barlow. (You can write this in your CV that you once worked with Eddie Desktop Barlow).

## Output

```text
The input may contain several data sets.

The first line of each data set contains an integer N (10  N  100) indicating the number of
players in the camp. The i-th (1  i  N) of the next N lines contains three integers: bti, bli and
fli (0  bt, bl, f l  100) representing respectively the batting, bowling and fielding scores of the ith
player. After these N lines follows another line containing three integers BT (1  BT  7), BL
(0  BL  5) and AR (0  AR  4), indicating respectively the number of batsmen, bowlers and
all-rounders required for the final team. You may always assume that BT +BL+AR = 10.

The input terminates with a value 0 for N .

## Sample Input

```text
For each data set in the input, first output the team number (starting from 1). In the 2nd line print
the sentence Maximum Effective score = , followed by the effective score of the best team. Print
Batsmen : , followed by the numbers of the players selected as batsmen in the 3rd line. The 4th
line will contain Bowlers : , followed by the numbers of the players selected as bowlers. In the 5th
line print All-rounders : , followed by the numbers of the players selected as all-rounders. If there
are multiple solutions any one of them is acceptable. Print a blank line between the outputs of two
consecutive data sets.
