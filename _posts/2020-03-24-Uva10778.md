Jack has been abducted by a man in black suit to Mathemagicland. Fortunately, he met a friend Donald
Duck. Donald Duck will help him escape only if he first finds all n-tuple solutions:

{x1, x2, . . . , xn}

and extract the rational numbers in order of magnitude from the n-tuple above, given that:

{1, 2, . . . , n}

where

k =


1a1<a2<...<a11<a1n

k
j=1

xaj

are called the elementary symmetric polynomials.
For example: if n = 1, then

1 =


1a1n

k
j=1

xaj =


1a11

1
j=1

xaj = x1

If n = 2, then

1 =


1a1n

k
j=1

xaj =


1a12

1
j=1

xaj =


1a12
xa1 = x1 + x2

2 =


1a1n

k
j=1

xaj =


1a1<a22

2
j=1

xaj =


1a1<a22
xa1xa2 = x1x2

If n = 3, then

1 =


1a13
xa1 = x1 + x2 + x3

2 =


1a1<a23

2
j=1

xaj =


1a1<a23
xa1xa2 = x1x2 + x1x3 + x2x3

3 =


1a1<a2<a33

3
j=1

xaj =


1a1<a2<a33
xa1xa2xa3 = x1x2x3

If n = 4, then

1 = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4

2 = x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 + x2x4 + x3x4

3 = x1x2x3 + x1x2x4 + x1x3x4 + x2x3x4

4 = x1x2x3x4

However, since most irrational numbers are impossible to represent exactly using a computer, you
are only required to output the rational components of in numerical order.

## Input

```
There are less than 1001 test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and k,
n > 0, |k| > 0, n < 101 ,|k| < 1001.

The second line contains n integers separated by a single space,

k1 k2 . . . kn

After the last test case, a single integer of 0 is given.

```

## Output

```
Each n-tuple solution should be outputted in exactly one line and in the form of:

kxa1 kxa2 . . . kxam

Such that

{am}  {1, 2, 3, . . . , n} such that xa1  QQ, kxa1  kxa2  . . .  kxan
Two n-tuple solutions are said to be the same if they have the same output. Two solutions are said

to be distinct if they are not the same. Output all distinct solutions in lexicographical order, one in
each line. If there is no solution, output No solution. without quotes. Print a blank line between
each test case.

Note: All inputs/outputs will fit into a standard 32-bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Input

```

## Sample Output

```
1 1
