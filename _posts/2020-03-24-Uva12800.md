title: Uva 12800  Cut
---


## Input

```

Every convex polygon, with 2N vertices, can be decomposed into N  1 quadrilaterals, by making
N  2 straight line cuts between certain pairs of vertices. The figure below shows three different
decompositions of the same polygon with N = 5. The weight of the decomposition is the sum of the
lengths of its N2 cuts. Your program should compute the weight of a minimum weight decomposition!
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains one integer N (2  N  100).
The following 2N lines contain, each one, two real numbers X and Y (0  X,Y  10000), with precision
of 4 decimal digits: the coordinates of the 2N points, in counterclockwise order, of the convex polygon.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input your program must output one line containing a real number, with 4
decimal digits precision. The number should be the weight of a minimum weight decomposition of the
given polygon.
