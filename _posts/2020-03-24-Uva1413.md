## Input

```text

A group of contestants sits at the round table and plays the following
game to relieve anxiety before the start of NEERC 2007. The game is
played with a single token that is given to one person at the beginning
of the game. This person passes the token to the adjacent person on
the left-hand side or to the adjacent person on the right-hand side with
a certain probability. A person who receives the token does the same
with his own probability and so on. The game ends when each person
has received the token at least once. The last person who has received
the token wins.

The problem is to find the probability of winning for the given
person. The probability of passing the token to the left or to the right
is individual for each person and is known in advance before the beginning of the game.

Contestants are numbered from 1 to n so that the person number 2 sits to the right of 1, the person
number 3 sits to the right of 2, and so on. The person number 1 sits to the right of n. The game starts
with the person whose number is specified in the input file and your task is to find the probability of
winning for the person number n.

Picture shows 7 contestants at the table with the token given to the person number 3.

## Output

```text
Input consists of several datasets. The first line of each dataset contains two integer numbers n and
k (2  n  50, 1  k < n). n denotes the total number of contestants, k denotes the number of the
person who has the token at the beginning of the game.

The second line of of each dataset contains n 1 numbers that denote the probabilities pi (0.01 
pi  0.99) of passing the token to the right for the persons numbered from 1 to n 1. The probability
of passing the token to the left for the person number i is 1  pi. The probabilities are given with at
most 2 digits after decimal point.

There is a blank line between consecutive test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each dataset, write to the output file a single number that denotes the probability of winning for
the person number n with a precision of at least 6 digits after decimal point.

Note: all probabilities in the third example are on the same line in the actual input file.
