title: Uva 12821  Double Shortest Paths
---


```

Alice and Bob are walking in an ancient maze with a lot of caves and one-way passages connecting
them. They want to go from cave 1 to cave n. All the passages are difficult to pass. Passages are too
small for two people to walk through simultaneously, and crossing a passage can make it even more
difficult to pass for the next person. We define di as the difficulty of crossing passage i for the first time,
and ai as the additional difficulty for the second time (e.g. the second persons difficulty is di + ai).

Your task is to find two (possibly identical) routes for Alice and Bob, so that their total difficulty
is minimized.

For example, in figure 1, the best solution is 1  2  4 for both Alice and Bob, but in figure 2, its
better to use 1  2  4 for Alice and 1  3  4 for Bob. Its always possible to reach cave n
from cave 1.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 200 test cases. Each case begins with two integers n, m (1  n  500, 1 
m  2000), the number of caves and passages. Each of the following m lines contains four integers u,
v, di and ai (1  u, v  n, 1  di  1000, 0  ai  1000). Note that there can be multiple passages
connecting the same pair of caves, and even passages connecting a cave and itself.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the minimal total difficulty.
