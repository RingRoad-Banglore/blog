title: Uva 00421  Polygonal Puzzle

```
To help model the three dimensional volumes that describe each supercomputer choice over time,
Valentine McKee and Jake Briggs decided to construct some cardboard mock-ups. Valentine began
by cutting out polygons of each of the supercomputer criteria for each year. As she was bringing the
cut-outs to Jakes lab, where they intended to turn the flat polygons into the actual volumes, Valentine
bumped into Ren McCormack. Literally. And she dropped all of her polygon cut-outs onto the ground.

Ren! Why dont you look where youre going, Valentine sighed. I dropped all of my polygons.
Now Im going to have to start all over cutting these out. Valentine had labeled the polygons prior to
cutting them out, but unfortunately, the labeling was not part of the actual polygon and was lost when
they were cut out. I dont know which is which now.

Sorry. Ren looked downcast, then brightened. Hey, do you want to go to the dance with me this
weekend?

I dont think so, Ren, replied Valentine, I think Ill be cutting out and sorting polygons all
weekend. Valentine stooped and began picking up the cut-outs. Ren was a great dancer but he also
tended to show it off. The one time that Valentine had gone to a dance with him, Ren had completely
embarrassed her with his antics.

Cant you use a computer or something to help you sort those things out? Ren picked up one of
the polygons and squinted at it. (Ren was a theater major.)

Valentine thought for a moment. Nope, she said. Im just going to have to start over. Have fun
at the dance this weekend, though. To herself, she thought, Yes, I can use a computer. The only
other thing I need is that camera that Jake already has in the lab to help me see the Big Picture.

## Input

```
The first line of input will consist of two integers separated by a space.
The first integer specifies the number of polygons to be sorted. The
second integer specifies the number of vertices for each polygon.

The rest of the input will consist of two lists of coordinates. The
first is a list of coordinates describing the shape of each polygon in
terms of the values on each of its axes (i.e., the values for r1 through
r6 in the figure on the right).

The vertices of each polygon are distributed at equal angles around the origin, with the first vertex
aligned at 12 oclock. The vertices are given in clockwise order. The polygons in this list are unique with
respect to rotation and dilation. That is, no polygon will be exactly like any other polygon (having the
same vertices in the same locations), nor can any polygon be rotated about its center and/or uniformly
scaled such that it will be exactly like another polygon in the list.

The second list of polygon coordinates corresponds to
the polygons in the first list, but as measured by a camera.
The vertices of each polygon in this case will be given as
(x, y) pairs with respect to the cameras viewpoint origin
and are given in clockwise order. The first vertex given is
arbitrary, however.

Note that the cameras view of each polygon may in-
clude magnification or de-magnification (which may be dif-
ferent for each viewed polygon). Moreover, the camera can
only resolve the polygon vertices to within plus or minus

one pixel in its field of view, so there may be some jitter associated with the viewed vertex locations.
For each polygon, the maximum amount of jitter at each vertex is guaranteed to be less than one
percent of the distance from the origin to the vertex farthest away from the origin.

All of the polygons viewed by the camera will be right-side up.

```

## Output

```
The output is a list of instructions indicating how to rearrange the scrambled polygons. That is, for
each polygon in the second list, the output should indicate the polygon to which it corresponds in the
first list, the amount by which it must be rotated in a clockwise direction to align the vertices. Thus,
one line of output consists of an integer index i (indexing starts from 1), a floating point angle  (with
0   < 360) given to the nearest tenth of a degree.
