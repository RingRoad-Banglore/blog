## Input

```text
Four friends join regularly to play Domino. They are friendly and always ready to spend the night
together playing Domino, but they are not uninformed by any means.

One of them, Bob, is specially cautious about the game. He wants to be so very well informed that
he wants to know, given the game (the pieces of all the players), which piece should he use first to start
the game so that the probability of wining is bigger.

The Domino game is fairly easy: there are twenty-eight (28) pieces, each one with two halves. Each
half has a number in it, from zero to six, represented as spots in the surface. You can see pieces as
pairs of numbers. So, the 28 pieces are composed by: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), ..., (0,0). Pieces can always be
seen from both halves, so, for instance, (6,5) is the same piece as (5,6).

In the game there are four (4) players. Pi, with i from 1 to 4. To start the game, each player has
seven (7) pieces, (pij1 , pij2), with i from 1 to 4, and j from 1 to 7, taken at random, and one of them
starts the game putting one piece in the center of the table. Then, all players play in turns putting one
piece into the table (if they have one applicable), by joining it with the ones that actually are in the
table. To build a set of pieces in the table, the pieces have to match by sides. That is, suppose that
in the table there are a set of pieces (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), , (xn, yn). It is always the case that
yi = x(i+1). Then, any player can put another piece (j, k), iff x1 = j or x1 = k or yn = k or yn = j.
Suppose that the latter, yn = j holds. The new set of pieces on the table would be:

(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), . . . , (xn, yn), (j, k).

Note also that, for the purposes of the game, the pieces in the table are equivalent if you put them
the other way round, that is,

(k, j), (yn, xn), . . . , (y3, x3), (y2, x2), (y1, x1).

The game ends when:

1. One player inserts into the table his or her last piece (he or she wins).

2. No player can put a new piece. In this case, a sum is computed for each player, counting the
numeric value of each part of each piece the player has left. The winner is the player with less
points, that is:

Cw|Cw < Ci, i  [1, . . . , 4]

where
Ci =


j  available pieces player i

pij1 + pij2

and player w wins. Note that if there are more than one player that hold the minimum value,
there is no winner of this game.

At a given point, Bob is informed of all the pieces that the other players have received. The pieces
of each player are these:

The first turn goes to Bob, and he wants to know the probability of wining this game if he starts
with any of his pieces... Would you help him?

## Output

```text
The input will be composed of lines. Each line contains the specification of a piece that Bob has (one
of the 7 pieces listed above), composed as follows:

 A left parenthesis (,

 The number of the part, x, (from 0 to 6),

 a comma ,,

 The number of the other part, y, (from 0 to 6),

 A right parenthesis ).

Note that at this point, again, (x, y) is equivalent to (y, x).

the number of all possible games played starting with that piece where Bob loses the game.

```
