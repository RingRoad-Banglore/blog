## Input

```
Two siblings are trying to figure out a way of sharing a packet
of candy. They would like to divide it as equally as possible.
The problem is that they are all attached into one continuous
strip. Sharing it would involve breaking the strip into smaller
pieces containing one or more individual candies. The candies
themselves are not all the same, thus in a totally fair distribu-
tion, each sibling must get an equal number of the same type
of candy.

But, being small children, they also have some additional
(and more annoying) demands. Each sibling must get exactly
one whole segment broken off from the main strip, and that
one segment must contain all the candies that form his share.
The child will not accept more than one segment for his or
her share. What is more, the order of the candies from left to
right in one childs segment must be exactly the same as that
in other childs (and rotating the strip is not allowed), otherwise they have difficulty verifying that they
have got a fair distribution. So both segments must be exactly the same. To make matters worse, there
are certain types of candies that neither sibling wants. Those candies cannot be in the segment handed
to the children, because they consider any segment containing those candies to be ruined.

Your job is, given a large strip of candy and a list of bad candies, identify the largest contiguous
segment that occurs at least twice (the two occurrences cannot overlap, obviously) and does not have
any bad candies in it. Any left over candy is discarded. If there are no such segments in the strip, the
whole strip is discarded and the children get nothing.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains a single integer N (N  50). N cases follow. Each case consists of
exactly two lines. The first line is a non-empty string (1  length  1000) describing one large strip of
candy. Each candy is given a unique character that is either a lower case or upper case English letter
(a to z or A to Z, both ranges inclusive). The second line is a string of characters corresponding to
bad candies. Like the first line, this string consists of upper or lower case English letters. But in some
cases there may not be any bad candies (i.e. there are no candy types that the children dont like), and
the second line will be an empty line instead. Furthermore, each candy can occur only once in the list
of bad candies (no duplicates).

Each candy corresponds to exactly one unique letter, so upper case and lower case forms of the
same character denote different candies (i.e. a and A are not the same candy).

```

## Sample Input

```
Your program should print exactly N lines of output, one for each input case.

Each line should be of the form Case #X: Y , where X is the case number and Y is the size of
the largest segment that at least two non-overlapping occurrences and has no bad candies in it. If there
is no such segment, Y is zero.
