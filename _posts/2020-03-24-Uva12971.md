## Input

```text
When he was in the old medina of Marrakech, Mr. Ed and his pals visited a famous Berber market.
There were several vendors offering all kind of species, cloths, babouches, lamps and tea pots. As you
may imagine, Mr. Ed wanted to buy many souvenirs for all his family. He approached to one of the
vendors and asked the price for a pair of babouches, then, the vendor asked How much are you willing
to pay? Mr. Ed understood that he needed to use his business abilities to set a fair price. Ill not
pay more than 30 euros for that  said Mr. Ed, Let me make you a deal, you give me 35 euros, I
give you back 10 dirhams and the babouches are yours  replied the vendor.

Mr. Ed accepted the previous deal and later noticed that he had been cheated! Furious, Mr.
Ed decided that he would not be cheated again, so he started to bargain with the vendors to gather
information about the prices for a pair of babouches. After several minutes, he managed to bargain
with n vendors.

The i-th vendor he bargained with gave euros a value of ei and dirhams a value of di. After
realizing that, he came up with an inequality of the form: ei EUR  di MAD > ci, meaning that the
total value of euros and dirhams Mr. Ed pays must be more than ci if he expects the vendor to accept;
or ei EUR  di MAD < ci, meaning that he only accepts if the total value of euros and dirhams he
pays is less than ci.

After gathering such information Mr. Ed was ready to buy again. He still had E euros and D
dirhams in his pocket, but now youre wondering: which was the effective area of prices he could
bargain with that money? The effective area of prices is the area of every possible way Mr. Ed could
buy the babouches satisfying the n inequalities, assuming any positive real number of euros and dirhams.
