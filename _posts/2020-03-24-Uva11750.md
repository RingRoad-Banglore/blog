title: Uva 11750  RedBlue Tree
---


## Input

```
Given a rooted tree T and a set S of pairs
of vertices from T , we say that T is a red-
blue tree on S if it is possible to colour
every vertex in the tree with either red or
blue such that the following holds:

For each pair of vertices (a, b) in S,
consider the unique path in T connecting
a to b. Any two vertices on this path
that share a common parent in T must
be coloured with different colours.

Given a rooted tree T , a set of vertex
pairs S, and the fact that T is a red-blue
tree on S, you are to find the maximum
number of pairs from S that can be si-
multaneously connected in T using each
tree edge at most once.
```

## Output

```
Each test case starts with three integers 1  n  100, 0  k  3000 and 1  r  n which are the
number of vertices, number of pairs and index of the root, respectively. Next n  1 lines contain two
integers between 1 and n describing two endpoints of an edge. Next k lines contain two integers between
1 and n giving a pair of vertices. Input is terminated with a line consisting of n = k = r = 0. You
are guaranteed each input graph is a connected tree rooted at the given r and is a red-blue tree on the
given pairs.

```

## Sample Input

```
There is a line of output for each test case containing the maximum number of pairs from the given list
that can be simultaneously connected using each tree edge at most once.
