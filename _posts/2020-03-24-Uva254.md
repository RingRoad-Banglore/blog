## Input

```text
In 1883, Edouard Lucas invented, or perhaps reinvented, one of the most popular puzzles of all times
 the Tower of Hanoi, as he called it  which is still used today in many computer science textbooks
to demonstrate how to write a recursive algorithm or program. First of all, we will make a list of the
rules of the puzzle:

 There are three pegs: A, B and C.

 There are n disks. The number n is constant while working the puzzle.

 All disks are different in size.

 The disks are initially stacked on peg A so that they increase in size from the top to the bottom.

 The goal of the puzzle is to transfer the entire tower from the A peg to one of the others pegs.

 One disk at a time can be moved from the top of a stack either to an empty peg or to a peg with
a larger disk than itself on the top of its stack.

A good way to get a feeling for the puzzle is to write a program which will show a copy of the
puzzle on the screen and let you simulate moving the disks around. The next step could be to write
a program for solving the puzzle in a efficient way. You dont have to do neither, but only know the
actual situation after a given number of moves by using a determinate algorithm.

The Algorithm
It is well known and rather easy to prove that the minimum number of moves needed to complete

the puzzle with n disks is 2n  1. A simple algorithm which allows us to reach this optimum is as
follows: for odd moves, take the smallest disk (number 1) from the peg where it lies to the next one in
the circular sequence ABCABC . . . ; for even moves, make the only possible move not involving disk 1.
```

## Output

```text
The input file will consist of a series of lines. Each line will contain two integers n, m: n, lying within
the range [0, 100], will denote the number of disks and m, belonging to [0, 2n  1], will be the number
of the last move. The file will end at a line formed by two zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output will consist again of a series of lines, one for each line of the input. Each of them will be
formed by three integers indicating the number of disks in the pegs A, B and C respectively, when
using the algorithm described above.
