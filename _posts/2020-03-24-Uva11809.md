title: Uva 11809  Floating-Point Numbers

## Input

```text
Floating-point numbers are represented differently in computers than integers. That is why a 32-bit
floating-point number can represent values in the magnitude of 1038 while a 32-bit integer can only
represent values as high as 232.

Although there are variations in the ways floating-point numbers are stored in Computers, in this
problem we will assume that floating-point numbers are stored in the following way:

Floating-point numbers have two parts mantissa and exponent. M -bits are allotted for mantissa
and E bits are allotted for exponent. There is also one bit that denotes the sign of number (If this
bit is 0 then the number is positive and if it is 1 then the number is negative) and another bit that
denotes the sign of exponent (If this bit is 0 then exponent is positive otherwise negative). The value of
mantissa and exponent together make the value of the floating-point number. If the value of mantissa
is m then it maintains the constraints 1

2
 m < 1. The left most digit of mantissa must always be 1 to

maintain the constraint 1
2
 m < 1. So this bit is not stored as it is always 1. So the bits in mantissa

actually denote the digits at the right side of decimal point of a binary number (Excluding the digit
just to the right of decimal point)

In the figure above we can see a floating-point number where M = 8 and E = 6. The largest value
this floating-point number can represent is (in binary) 0.1111111112  21111112 . The decimal equivalent
to this number is: 0.998046875  263 = 920535763834529382410. Given the maximum possible value
represented by a certain floating point type, you will have to find how many bits are allotted for mantissa
(M) and how many bits are allotted for exponent (E) in that certain type.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains around 300 line of input. Each line contains a floating-point number F that
denotes the maximum value that can be represented by a certain floating-point type. The floating point
number is expressed in decimal exponent format. So a number AeB actually denotes the value A10B.
A line containing 0e0 terminates input. The value of A will satisfy the constraint 0 < A < 10 and
will have exactly 15 digits after the decimal point.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the value of M and E. You can
assume that each of the inputs (except the last one) has a possible and unique solution. You can also

assume that inputs will be such that the value of M and E will follow the constraints: 9  M  0 and
30  E  1. Also there is no need to assume that (M + E + 2) will be a multiple of 8.
