title: Uva 11347  Multifactorials
---


## Input

```
A generalization of the factorials gives us multifactorials:

n! = n  (n 1)  (n 2)  (n 3) . . .
n!! = n  (n 2)  (n 4)  (n 6) . . .
n!!! = n  (n 3)  (n 6)  (n 9) . . .

In general (there are k marks !):

n!! . . .! = n  (n k)  (n 2k) . . . (n mod k), if k doesnt divide n,
n!! . . .! = n  (n k)  (n 2k) . . . k, if k divides n

It this problem you are given a multifactorial, and you have to find the number of different dividers
it has.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains integer N (0 < N  500), it is number of tests. Each of the next N lines contains
a multifactorial. Integer part of multifactorial is less or equal to 1000 and there are no more then 20
characters !.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print line formatted like this: Case i: a. Where i is a test number, and a is the
number of dividers in multifactorial. If number of dividers exceed 1018 print Infinity (see examples).

```

## Sample Output

```
3
5!
13!!
230!

```
