Aoccdrnig to a rseearch at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it deosnt mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod

by itslef but the wrod as a wlohe.

I hope you did not have much trouble reading the paragraph above and have realized that the
research result is somewhat true. If you are still having trouble reading the paragraph above go to the
end of this problem to see the actual paragraph.

At first glance this research may appear as a joke but if you think for quite sometime you will find
that this is not a joke at all since words of length 1, 2, 3 and 4 are merely affected by the scrambling
that is being suggested here. And in a normal English text, words of length less than five makes almost
62% of the total words. However to solve this problem you neither need this statistics nor need to prove
the correctness of this research.

In this problem you will be given a dictionary of correct words and list of scrambled words. The
first and the last letter of a scrambled word are the same as the original word. Position of letters
between them may or may not be altered. Your job is to find out the total number of words in the
dictionary that can actually be the correct form of the given scrambled word. You also need to find
the lexicographically smallest and largest such word in the dictionary, when the word is present in the
dictionary.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains a single set of input. The first line of the input file is an integer N (0 < N <
500001) which indicates how many words are there in the given dictionary. Each of the next N lines
will contain one word. All the words have less than 9 characters. The very next line contains an integer
Q (Q < 50001) which indicates the total number of query. Each of the next Q lines contain 1 word
(All query words have less than 16 characters). All words in the input file are made with lowercase
alphabets.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each query you should output a single line. This single line should contain an integer F (must) and
two strings S1 and S2 (These two strings will be present only when F > 0). The integer F denotes
how many words are there in the dictionary that can be the correct form of the scrambled word in the
query. S1 is the lexicographically smallest such word in the dictionary and S2 is the lexicographically
largest such word in the dictionary.

First paragraph original text
According to a research at an English university, it doesnt matter in what order the letters in a

word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter is at the right place. The rest can
be a total mess and you can still read it without any problem. This is because we do not read every
letter by itself but the word as a whole.
