title: Uva 01093  Castles
---


## Input

```text
Wars have played a significant role in world history. Unlike modern wars, armies in the middle ages
were principally concerned with capturing and holding castles, the private fortified residences of lords
and nobles. The size of the attacking army was an important factor in an armys ability to capture and
hold one of these architectural masterpieces.

A certain minimum number of soldiers were re-
quired to capture a castle. Some soldiers were ex-
pected to die during the attack. After capturing the
castle, some soldiers were required to remain in the
castle to defend it against attacks from another en-
emy. Of course, those numbers were different for
different castles. Commanders of the armies were
obliged to consider the number of soldiers required
for victory. For example, there are five castles in the
region map shown in Figure 2. The castle at the lower
right requires at least 20 soldiers to wage a winning
attack. None are expected to perish during the at-
tack, and 10 soldiers must be left in the castle when
the army moves on.

In this problem you must determine the minimum size of an army needed to capture and hold all
the castles in a particular region. For reasons of security, there is exactly one (bi-directional) route
between any pair of castles in the region. Moving into the neighborhood of an uncaptured castle begins
an attack on that castle. Any castle can serve as the first castle to be attacked, without regard for
how the army got there. Once any castle has been captured, the requisite number of soldiers is left in
the castle to defend it, and the remainder of the army moves on to do battle at another castle, if any
remain uncaptured. The army may safely pass through the neighborhood of a castle that it has already
captured. But because of the potential for attacks, the army may traverse the route between a pair of
castles no more than twice (that is, at most once in each direction).

## Output

```text
The input contains multiple test cases corresponding to different regions. The description of the castles
in each region occupies several lines. The first line contains an integer n  100 that is the number of
castles in the region. Each of the next n lines contains three integers a, m, and g (1  a  1000, 0 
m  a, 1  g  1000), that give the minimum number of soldiers required to successfully attack and
capture a particular castle, the number of soldiers that are expected to die during the attack, and the
number of soldiers that must be left at the castle to defend it. The castles are numbered 1 to n, and
the input lines describing them are given in increasing order of castle numbers. Each of the remaining
n  1 lines in a test case has two integers that specify the castle numbers of a pair of castles that are
connected by a direct route.

A line containing 0 follows the description of the last region.
