title: Uva 13089  Golden Coins
---


## Input

```
Nik and Ann are playing a game. They have a tree with n nodes numbered from 1 to n.

Each node has 0 to m (0  m  109) golden coins.

Before the game starts they select a single node as the treasure chest. Suppose d(u) denotes the
distance between node u and the treasure chest.

The players make their move alternatively. In each move they do the followings:

 Select any single node u which has positive number of coins in it.

 Pick one coin from that node and move it to any node v such that d(v) < d(u).

The game ends when no one can make a move (when all the coins are in the chest). Whoever cant
make a move loses the game. Ann always makes the first move and both play optimally.

As Nik is a good programmer, he knows that if the treasure chest is chosen carefully, he can always
win the game.

Find number of ways the treasure chest can be chosen so that Nik always wins the game.
```

## Output

```
First line will contain an integer number T (1  T  100) denoting number of test cases. First line of
each test case will consist of a single integer n (1  n  1000). Next line will contain n integers, where
i-th integer denotes number of coins in node i. Each of the next n1 lines will contain two integer
numbers u and v denoting an edge of the tree.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print case number and number of ways the treasure chest can be chosen so that Nik
always wins the game.
