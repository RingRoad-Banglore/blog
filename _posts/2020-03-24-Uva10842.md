title: Uva 10842  Traffic Flow
---


## Input

```
Arnie Pie in the sky with the morning commute.
Traffic this morning is as bad as it gets. Due to
a fire at the army testing lab a bunch of escaped,
infected mokeys are roaming the expressway. Despite
the swealtering heat, dont unroll your windows
cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable.
Arnie Pie, "The Simpsons."

A city has n intersections and m bidirectional roads connecting pairs of intersections. Each road
has a certain traffic flow capacity, measured in cars per minute. There is a path from every intersection
to every other intersection along some sequence of roads. The road maintenance department is over
budget and needs to close as many roads as possible without disconnecting any intersections. They
want to do it in such a way that the minimum capacity among all of the remaining roads is as large as
possible.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a line
containing n (0 < n  100) and m (0 < m  10000). The next m lines will describe the m roads, each
one using 3 integers, u, v and c (0  u, v < n), (0 < c  1000). u and v are the endpoints of the road
and c is its capacity.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the capacity of the minimum-
capacity remaining road.
