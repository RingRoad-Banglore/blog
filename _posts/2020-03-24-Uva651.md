## Input

```text
A single playing card can be placed on a table, carefully, so that the short edges of the card are parallel
to the tables edge, and half the length of the card hangs over the edge of the table. If the card hung
any further out, with its center of gravity off the table, it would fall off the table and flutter to the
floor. The same reasoning applies if the card were placed on another card, rather than on a table.

Two playing cards can be arranged, carefully, with short edges parallel to table edges, to extend 3/4
of a card length beyond the edge of the table. The top card hangs half a card length past the edge of
the bottom card. The bottom card hangs with only 1/4 of its length past the tables edge. The center
of gravity of the two cards combined lies just over the edge of the table.

Three playing cards can be arranged, with short edges parallel to table edges, and each card touching
at most one other card, to extend 11/12 of a card length beyond the edge of the table. The top two
cards extend 3/4 of a card length beyond the edge of the bottom card, and the bottom card extends
only 1/6 over the tables edge; the center of gravity of the three cards lines over the edges of the table.

If you keep stacking cards so that the edges are aligned and every card has at most one card above
it and one below it, how far out can 4 cards extend over the tables edge? Or 52 cards? Or 1000 cards?
Or 99999?
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several nonnegative integers, one to a line. No integer exceeds 99999.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The standard output will contain, on successful completion of the program, a heading:

# Cards Overhang

(thats two spaces between the words) and, following, a line for each input integer giving the length of
the longest overhang achievable with the given number of cards, measured in cardlengths, and rounded
to the nearest thousandth. The length must be expressed with at least one digit before the decimal
point and exactly three digits after it.

The number of cards is right-justified in column 5, and the decimal points for the lengths lie in
column 12.

Note: The line of digits in the sample output below is intended to guide you in proper output alignment,
and is not part of the output that your solution should produce.
