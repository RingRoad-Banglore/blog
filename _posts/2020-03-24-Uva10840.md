title: Uva 10840  Multi-stage Compressor

## Input

```text
As part of an engeener team in ACM (Association for Compressors and Machinery) youre working in
an air-condition system for a plane. As ambient air at 10km over surface is too cold, you have to mix
it with some hot air from the engine.

To design the system, you need to know the pressure of the hot air at the bleeding point. Youre
supposed to bleed the air from one of the stages of the compressor in the engine. Unfortunately, you
dont know pressures at intermediate stages, you can only measure pressure at the begining of the
compressor. So, in this problem youll have to calculate pressure at stage i.

About the compressor, you know:

 Its global pressure ratio, that is, the pressure at the end of the compressor (pn+1) divided by the
ambient pressure (p1). Since you know ambient pressure, you can easily calculate the pressure at
the end of the compressor.

 The air is a perfect gas (that is, parameters cp and  are constant).

 After every stage of the compressor, there is a system that turns airs temperature, Ti, into
ambient air temperature, T1. We suppose theres no pressure loss in this process.

 The compressor has some constant (unknown) parametes: i (efficiency) and m (the mass of air
entering in the compressor each second). i is defined as:

i =
1

(
pi+1
pi

) y1
y

1 Ti+1
Ti

 Compressors global power needed is minimum. Power for each stage is defined as:

Wi = m  cp  (Ti+1  Ti)

With all these, stage is representation is as follows:
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one is a line containing
n (the number of stages), p1 (p1 > 0) (ambient pressure), pn+1 (pn+1  p1) (final pressure) and i (with
1  i  n+ 1) (the stage you bleed air from).
