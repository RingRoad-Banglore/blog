Traveling salesmen of . (the prestigious Korean internet company) report their current location
to the company on a regular basis. They also have to report their new location to the company if
they are moving to another location. The company keep each salesmans working path on a map of his
working area and uses this path information for the planning of the next work of the salesman. The
map of a salesmans working area is represented as a connected and undirected graph, where vertices
represent the possible locations of the salesman an edges correspond to the possible movements between
locations. Therefore the salesmans working path can be denoted by a sequence of vertices in the graph.
Since each salesman reports his position regularly an he can stay at some place for a very long time,
the same vertices of the graph can appear consecutively in his working path. Let a salesmans working
path be correct if two consecutive vertices correspond either the same vertex or two adjacent vertices
in the graph.

For example on the following graph representing the working
area of a salesman, a reported working path [1 2 2 6 5 5 5 7
4] is a correct path. But a reported working path [1 2 2 7 5 5
5 7 4] is not a correct path since there is no edge in the graph
between vertices 2 a 7. If we assume that the salesman reports
his location every time when he has to report his location (but
possibly incorrectly), then the correct path could be [1 2 2 4 5 5
5 7 4], [1 2 4 7 5 5 5 7 4], or [1 2 2 6 5 5 5 7 4].

The length of a working path is the number of vertices in the
path. We define the distance between two paths A = a1a2 . . . an
and B = b1b2 . . . bn of the same length n as

dist(A,B) =

n
i=1

d(ai, bi)

where

d(a, b) =

{
0 if a = b
1 otherwise

Given a graph representing the working area of a salesman and a working path (possible not a
correct path), A, of a salesman, write a program to compute a correct working path, B, of the same
length where the distance dist(A,B) is minimized.

## Input

```
The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T ) is given in the first line of the input.
The first line of each test case contains two integers n1, n2 (3  n1  100, 2  n2  4, 950) where n1 is
the number of vertices of the graph representing the working map of a salesman and n2 is the number
of edges in the graph. The input graph is a connected graph. Each vertex of the graph is numbered
from 1 to n1. In the following n2 lines, each line contains a pair of vertices which represent an edge of
the graph. The last line of each test case contains information on a working path of the salesman. The
first integer n (2  n  200) in the line is the length of the path and the following n integers represent
the sequence of vertices in the working path.

correct path of the same length.
