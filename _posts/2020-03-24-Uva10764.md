```
Typically, in a base b number system the digit set is {0, 1, . . . , b 1}.

However, it is possible to allow a digit set with negative digits
{a,(a 1), . . . ,1, 0, 1, . . . , (a 1), a}

with appropriately chosen a. In the sequel, the negative digits will be writ-
ten as d when d is a positive digit, such that a negative digit occupies two
characters in a recording of a number. For example, with b = 10 and a = 6
we have the following digits

{6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

The resulting number system is called signed-digit system and in order to
make the parameters explicit we call it SD(b, a) system, in the case above SD(10, 6). Computing a
number from its representation in an SD system is the same as in usual number systems, just some
digits have negative values.

Using two digits in SD(10, 6) we can record all the numbers in the range 66..66, i.e. in the usual
decimal notation the range is 66..66, but with the new digits we do not need a sign for the entire
number. The SD systems are redundant in that a number can have more than one representation. For
example, in SD(10, 6) the decimal number 4 has at least two representations: 4 and 16.

The redundancy of SD(b, a) number system allows to design faster algorithms for addition. If the
following conditions are satisfied 

(b+ 1)

2


 a  b 1

we can choose one of the available representations of each number in such a way that we can design
an algorithm for addition which runs in constant time as the carry propagation can be eliminated.
However, we will not be concerned with carry propagation here.

Your task is simple. Given a number n in usual decimal notation fitting into a 32-bit integer,
a positive b  10 and a satisfying the conditions stated above, you are asked to convert n into its
SD(b, a) representation where the negative digits are recorded as explained above. If n has more than
one representation in SD(b, a), then anyone will do.

## Input

```
The input file contains a sequence of lines, each line contains three numbers: n, b and a. The last line
of input has b = 0 and should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output containing a representation of n in SD(b, a).
