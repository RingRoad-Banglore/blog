## Input

```text

Fig 1. An irrigation system

You have a piece of land, which is divided into an n m grid. In
some squares there is a water source capable of providing water
for a certain number of other squares. A water source can provide
water for zero or more consecutive squares directly to the north,
zero or more consecutive squares directly to the east and so on.

Water is precious, so you have just enough water to irrigate
the whole piece of land. So its crucial to design an irrigation
system so that every square is either a water source or irrigated
by exactly one water source.

On the right is an example. Water sources are represented
in the form id(water). So the 4-th water is capable of provide
water for 5 other squares.

## Output

```text
The input consists of at most 50 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing three non-negative
integers n, m and k (1  n,m  30, 1  k  200), where k is the number of water sources. In the
following k lines water sources are described, by three non-negative integers x, y, c (1  x  n, 1  y 
m), the coordinate and water capacity (west-south corner is (1,1)), one line for each water source. It is
guaranteed that nm k = c1 + c2 + . . .+ ck (just enough water). The last case is followed by a single
zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number in the first line, then k lines followed, one for each water
source. Each water source is described by four non-negative integers n, e, s, w, the amount of squares
irrigated in each direction. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. Print a blank line after
each test case.
