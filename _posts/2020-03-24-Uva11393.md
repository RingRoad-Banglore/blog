title: Uva 11393  Tri-Isomorphism
---


## Input

```text
Let V (G) be the vertex set of a simple graph and E(G) its edge set. An
Isomorphism from a simple graph G to a simple graph H is a bijection f :
V (G)  V (H) such that uv  E(G) if and only if f(u)f(v)  E(H). We say,
G is isomorphic to H if there is an isomorphism from G to H.

A complete graph is a simple graph whose vertices are pairwise adjacent:
the unlabeled complete graph with n vertices is denoted Kn. For example,
the following figure shows K5.

Finally, a decomposition of a graph is a list of subgraphs such that each
edge appears in exactly one subgraph in the list.

Now, given a positive integer n, you are to determine if Kn decomposes
into three pairwise-isomorphic subgraphs.
```

## Output

```text
First line of each test case consists of a positive integer n (n  100). The end of input will be indicated
by a case where n = 0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print YES if Kn can be decomposed into three pairwise-isomorphic subgraphs and
NO otherwise.

Constraints

 n < 100
