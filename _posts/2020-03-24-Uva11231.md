title: Uva 11231  Black and white painting
---


## Input

```
You are visiting the Centre Pompidou which contains a lot of modern paintings. In particular you
notice one painting which consists solely of black and white squares, arranged in rows and columns like
in a chess board (no two adjacent squares have the same colour). By the way, the artist did not use
the tool of problem A to create the painting.

Since you are bored, you wonder how many 8 8 chess boards are embedded within this painting.
The bottom right corner of a chess board must always be white.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of one line with three integers n, m and
c. (8  n,m  40000), where n is the number of rows of the painting, and m is the number of columns
of the painting. c is always 0 or 1, where 0 indicates that the bottom right corner of the painting is
black, and 1 indicates that this corner is white.

The last test case is followed by a line containing three zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the number of chess boards embedded within the given painting.

```

## Sample Output

```
8 8 0
8 8 1
