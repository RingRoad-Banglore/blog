title: Uva 10828  Back to KernighanRitchie
---


```
You must have heard the name of Kernighan and Ritchie, the authors of
The C Programming Language. While coding in C, we use different control
statements and loops, such as, if-then-else, for, do-while, etc. Consider the
following fragment of pseudo code:

//execution starts here
do {

U;
V;

} while(condition);
W;

In the above code, there is a bias in each conditional branch. Such
codes can be represented by control flow graphs like below:

Let the probability of jumping from one node of the graph to any of its adjacent nodes be equal.
So, in the above code fragment, the expected number of times U executes is 2. In this problem, you
will be given with such a control flow graph and find the expected number of times a node is visited
starting from a specific node.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases. There will be maximum 100 test cases. Each case starts with an
integer: n (n  100). Here n is the number of nodes in the graph. Each node in the graph is labeled
with 1 to n and execution always starts from 1. Each of the next few lines has two integers: start and
end which means execution may jump from node start to node end. A value of zero for start ends this
list. After this, there will be an integer q (q  100) denoting the number of queries to come. Next q
lines contain a node number for which you have to evaluate the expected number of times the node is
visited. The last test case has value of zero for n which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
Output for each test case should start with Case #i: with next q lines containing the results of the
queries in the input with three decimal places. There can be situations where a node will be visited
forever (for example, an infinite for loop). In such cases, you should print infinity (without the
quotes). See the sample output section for details of formatting.
