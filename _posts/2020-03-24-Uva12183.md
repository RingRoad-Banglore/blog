## Input

```text
Ralph was hired as a knight by a rich German earl some years ago. One day, he captured a spy that
presumably intended to deliver a message to his earls arch-enemy. At those ancient times, it was very
popular to engrave a message into the inside of a ring in order to hide it. Knowing about this technique,
Ralph quickly examined the spys rings and found the message. But, unfortunately, it was encrypted.

Thus, Ralph tortured the spy until he disclosed how to decode the engraved message: The encrypted
message is a single line of N numbers. One has to apply the following decoding procedure for S times:
add to each number L times the number to its left and R times the number to its right. Note, that due
to the cyclic engraving each number has exactly two neighbours. As numbers can be quite large, one
only has to take care of the X lower digits.

Unfortunately, Ralph has never learnt how to add and multiply numbers. Please help him!
```

## Output

```text
The first line indicates the number T of test cases that follow. Test cases are separated by a blank
line. Each test case starts with a line holding N , S, L, R, and X separated by single spaces (2 < N 
1000, 0  S  230, 0 < L,R,X < 10). The next line contains N numbers (separated by single spaces).
These numbers are the encrypted message from left to right. Each of these numbers is a non-negative
integer less than 1000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing the N decrypted numbers, separated by single spaces.
