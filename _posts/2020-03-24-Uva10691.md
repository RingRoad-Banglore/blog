title: Uva 10691  Subway
---


## Input

```
The government in a foreign land is looking into the possibility of establishing a subway system in its
capital. Because of practical reasons, they would like each subway line to start at the central station
and then go in a straight line in some angle as far as necessary. You have been hired to investigate
whether such an approach is feasible. You have been given the coordinates of important places in the
city which must lie close to a subway station (possibly the central station). Exactly how close they
must lie is determined by another parameter, also given. Your job is to calculate the minimum number
of subway lines needed to satisfy the demands of the government. You may assume that any number
of subway stations can be built along a subway line.
```

## Output

```
The first line in the input file contains an integer N , the number of data sets to follow (at most 20). Each
set starts with two integers, n and d (1  n  200, 0  d < 150). n is the number of important places
in the city that must have a subway station nearby, and d is the maximum distance allowed between
an important place and a subway station. Then comes n lines, each line containing two integers x and
y (100  x, y  100), the coordinates of an important place in the capital. The central station will
always have coordinates 0, 0. All pair of coordinates within a data set will be distinct (and none will
be 0, 0).

Note: The figure above corresponds to the first sample input

```

## Sample Input

```
For each data set, output a single integer on a line by itself: the minimum number of subway lines
needed to make sure all important places in the city is at a distance of at most d from a subway station.
