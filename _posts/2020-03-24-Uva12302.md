title: Uva 12302  NinePoint Circle
---


```
In geometry, the nine-point circle is a circle that can be con-
structed for any given triangle. It is so named because it passes
through nine significant points defined from the triangle. These
nine points are:

 The midpoint of each side of the triangle

 The foot of each altitude

 The midpoint of the line segment from each vertex of the
triangle to the orthocenter (where the three altitudes meet;
these line segments lie on their respective altitudes).

The nine-point circle is also known as Feuerbachs circle, Eulers circle, Terquems circle, the six-
point circle, the twelve-point circle, the n-point circle, the medioscribed circle, the mid circle or the
circum-midcircle.

Given three non-collinear points A, B and C, youre to calculate the center position and radius of
triangle ABCs nine-point circle.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each case contains 6 integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 (0 
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3  1000), the coordinates of A, B and C. The last test case is followed by a line
with six -1, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print three real numbers x, y, r, indicating that the nine point circle is centered at
(x, y), with radius r. The numbers should be rounded to six decimal places.

```

## Sample Input

```
0 0 10 0 3 4
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

```

## Sample Output

```
4.000000 2.312500 2.519456
