## Input

```
You got the original idea of making map software, called Moogle Maps, for
the new cool Maple mPhone. It will even be capable of indicating the location
of a house address like Main Street 13. However, since the mPhone has
limited storage capacity, you need to reduce the data amount. You dont
want to store the exact location of every single house number. Instead only
a subset of the house numbers will be stored exactly, and the others will be
linearly interpolated. So you want to select house numbers that will minimise
the average interpolation error, given how many house locations you have
capacity to store. We view the street as a straight line, and you will always
store the first and the last house location.

Given that youve stored the locations xi and xj for the houses with
numbers i and j respectively, but no other house in between, the interpolated
value for a house with number k with i < k < j is xi + (xj  xi)  kiji
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives a single integer, 1  t  50, the number of test
cases.

For each test case, there are two lines. The first contains 2  h  200 and
2  c  h, where h is the number of houses in the street and c is the number of house locations that
can be stored. The second contains h integers in increasing order giving the location of the h houses.
Each location is in the interval [0, 1000000].

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the average interpolation error over all the h houses for the optimal selection
of c house locations to store. The output should be given with four decimal places, but we will accept
inaccuracies of up to 0.001.

```
