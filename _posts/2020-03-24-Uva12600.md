title: Uva 12600  Counting Necklaces
---


## Input

```
A necklace is consisted of N identical beads and your job is to color the beads. Note that, in necklace
the beads are arranged circularly, that is  first bead is adjacent to second bead, second bead is
adjacent to third one, ..., last one is adjacent to first one. Each bead should be colored with exactly one
color and you have K different types of colors available. Now a coloring of the necklace is considered
beautiful if for any three adjacent beads all of them have different colors.

Given three integers N , K and M : find how many different beautiful colorings are possible for an
N -bead necklace where you have K different types of colors available. Output the result modulo M
(%M). Two ways of coloring are considered different if it is not possible to have same color sequence
of beads by rotation. For example, when N = 4, K = 4, 1234, 2341, 3412 and 4123 are all
same.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains an integer T (T  100) which is the number of test cases. Each of the
following T lines contain three integers N (3  N  108), K (1  K  108) and M (2  M  108).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the case number, followed by the number of beautiful colorings modulo M
(%M).

Notes:
For the first case, the different ways are: 1234, 1324, 1423, 1243, 1342, 1432.
For the second case, the different ways are: 213 and 123.

## Sample Output

```

4 4 10000000
3 3 1000007
8 10 100000
