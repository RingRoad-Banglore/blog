## Input

```
Jack is making a long distance walk with some friends along the old pilgrim road from Vzelay to
Santiago de Compostela. Jack administers money for the group. His administration is quite simple.
Whenever an amount (e 60, say) has to be paid for the common good he will pay it, and write in his
booklet: PAY 60.

When needed, Jack will ask every member of the group, including himself, to pay an amount (e 50,
say) to the collective purse, and write in his booklet: COLLECT 50. If the group size is 7, he collects e
350 in total.

Unfortunately some of the group members cannot participate in the full walk. So sometimes the
group will grow, sometimes it will shrink. How does Jack handle these comings and goings of group
members in terms of collective money? Suppose, for example, the group size is 7, and that Jack has e
140 in cash, which is e 20 for every group member. If two group members leave, each will receive e 20,
and Jack will write in his booklet: OUT 2. If under the same circumstances three new group members
arrive, they will each have to pay e 20, and Jack will write: IN 3.

In these cases the amount in cash could easily be divided, without fractions. As a strange coin-
cidence, this happened during the whole trip. Jack never had to make calculations with fractional
numbers of euros.

Near the end of the trip, Jack was joined by all his fellow travelers. Nobody was willing to miss
the glorious finale of the trip. It was then that Jack tried to remember what the group size had been
during each part of the trip. He could not remember.

Given a page of Jacks booklet, could you figure out the size of the group at the beginning of that
page?

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case is a sequence of lines in Jacks booklet. The
first line of each test case will give the number N (0 < N  50) of lines to follow. The next N lines
have the format: < keyword > < num >, where

< keyword > = PAY | COLLECT | IN | OUT

and < num > is a positive integer, with the following restrictions:

IN k k  20
OUT k k  20
COLLECT k k  200
PAY k k  2000

The last case is followed by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a single line describing the size of the group at the beginning of the part of
the trip described in the test case. This line contains:

 The word IMPOSSIBLE, if the data are inconsistent.

 A single number giving the size of the group just prior to the sequence of lines in Jacks booklet,
if this size is uniquely determined by the data.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1054  Pilgrimage 2/2

 Several numbers, in increasing order, separated by spaces, giving the possible sizes of the group,
in case the number of solutions is finite, but the solution is not unique.

 A statement in the format: SIZE >= N , giving a lower bound for the size of the group, in case
the number of solutions is infinite. Observe that the inequality SIZE >= 1 always applies, since
at least Jack himself did the whole trip.
