title: Uva 00171  Car Trialling
---


## Input

```text
Car trialling requires the following of carefully worded instructions. When setting a trial, the organiser
places traps in the instructions to catch out the unwary.

Write a program to determine whether an instruction obeys the following rules, which are loosely
based on real car trialling instructions. BOLD-TEXT indicates text as it appears in the instruction
(case sensitive), | separates options of which exactly one must be chosen, and .. expands, so A..D is
equivalent to A|B|C|D .

instruction = navigational | time keeping | navigational AND time keeping
navigational = directional | navigational AND THEN directional
directional = how direction | how direction where
how = GO | GO when | KEEP
direction = RIGHT | LEFT
when = FIRST | SECOND | THIRD
where = AT sign
sign = "signwords"
signwords = s word | signwords s word
s word = letter | s word letter
letter = A..Z | .
time keeping = record | change
record = RECORD TIME
change = cas TO nnn KMH
cas = CHANGE AVERAGE SPEED | CAS
nnn = digit | nnn digit
digit = 0..9

Note that s  word and nnn are sequences of letters and digits respectively, with no intervening
spaces. There will be one or more spaces between items except before a period (.), after the opening
speech marks or before the closing speech marks.
```

## Output

```text
Each input line will consist of not more than 75 characters. The input will be terminated by a line
consisting of a single #.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output will consist of a series of sequentially numbered lines, either containing the valid instruction,
or the text Trap! if the line did not obey the rules. The line number will be right justified in a field
of 3 characters, followed by a full-stop, a single space, and the instruction, with sequences of more than
one space reduced to single spaces.

```

## Sample Output

```text
KEEP LEFT AND THEN GO RIGHT
CAS TO 20 KMH
GO FIRST RIGHT AT "SMITH ST." AND CAS TO 20 KMH
GO 2nd RIGHT
