## Input

```text
The depth of phi value of a number is denoted by the number of steps required before it reaches 1. An
example will make it very clear.

(13) = 12 . . . step1
(12) = 4 . . . step2
(4) = 2 . . . step3
(2) = 1 . . . step1

So the depth of phi(13) is 4. We name this function as depthphi. So we can write depthphi(13) = 4.
The sum of depthphi function (SODF) takes two integers as parameter and its definition is given below:

SODF(m,n) =
n

i=m

depthphi(i), m  n

Given the value of m and n your job is to find the value of SODF(m,n).

The following paragraph is extracted from Mathworld to inform you about phi function.
The totient function (n) or phi(n), also called Eulers totient function, is defined as the number

of positive integers  n that are relatively prime to (i.e., do not contain any factor in common with) n,
where 1 is counted as being relatively prime to all numbers. Since a number less than or equal to and
relatively prime to a given number is called a totative the totient function (n) can be simply defined
as the number of totatives of n. For example, there are eight totatives of 24 (1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and
23), so (24) = 8 . The totient function is implemented in Mathematica as EulerPhi[n].

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 2001) which indicates how many sets of
inputs are there. Each of the next N lines contains two integers m and n (2  m  n  2000000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer S, which actually
denotes the value of SODF(m,n).

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
2 10
100000 200000
