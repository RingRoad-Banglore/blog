```

History is filled with legends and stories associated with mazes and
labyrinths that have been shrouded by mystery.

In some ancient religion a maze functioned as a cult center and sym-
bolized mankinds search for all eternal truths.

In their initiation cult young people have to pass across a maze com-
posed by squared chambers that can communicate with the ones at the
north, south, east or west. They have to go from a start point to an end
point passing by the shortest number of chambers and have to follow some
ritual. They have to respect a sequence of 3 moves that will be repeated
until the end point is reached. In the first move they pass through one
chamber, in the second through two chambers and in the third through

three chambers. In each of these moves they cant change their direction.

Given a map of the chambers disposed in a rectangular grid find the
shortest path, in number of moves, from a start point to an end point.

Notice that, in the sequence of moves the ritual described above must
be respected. In each move you must pass through the corresponding
number of chambers, without changing your direction during a move. You
must begin with 1 chamber and repeat the sequence of 1, 2 and 3 chambers
until the end is reached. The end can be reached in any of the states.

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers separated by a single space: R (2  R  300)
corresponding to the number of rows and C (2  C  300) corresponding to the number of columns.

Each of the following R lines contains C characters. For each character, a dot . represents a
chamber, a hash mark # represents a wall and the capital letters S and E represent the start and
the end position respectively.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of one line for each test case containing the number of moves from S to E or
the word NO if there is no solution.
