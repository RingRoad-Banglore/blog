title: Uva 01117  Reliable Programs
---


```
Consider a machine with n integer registers r1, r2, . . . , rn and a single type of compare-exchange in-
struction, CE(i, j) defined as follows, where 1  i < j  n are the register indices:

CE(i, j): if content(ri) > content(rj)
then exchange the contents of registers ri and rj .

A compare-exchange program (shortly CE-program) is any finite sequence of compare-exchange
instructions. A CE-program is called minimum-finding if after its execution the register r1 always
contains the minimum value among all the initial values in the registers. Furthermore, such program
is called reliable if it remains a minimum-finding program after removing any single compare-exchange
instruction.

Given a CE-program P , what is the minimum number of instructions that should be added at the
end of program P in order to make it reliable?
Example

Consider the following 3-register CE-program: CE(1,2); CE(2,3); CE(1,2).
In order to make this program reliable it suffices to add only two extra instructions, namely CE(1,3)

and CE(1,2).
Write a program that reads the description of a CE-program, and determines the minimum number

of CE-instructions that should be added to make this program reliable.

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first line of input contains the number of registers n, where 0  n  1000, followed by the
number of program instructions m, where 0  m  3000.

The next line contains the program itself: a sequence of 2m integers, separated by spaces, where
each CE-instruction consists of two consecutive integers on positions 2j  1 and 2j, with 1  j  m.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

The output consists of a single integer: the minimal number of instructions that should be added
to the input program in order to make this program reliable.
