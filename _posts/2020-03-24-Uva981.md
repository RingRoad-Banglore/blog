title: Uva 00981  Systematic Cyclic Redundancy Check Codes
---


## Input

```

An error-detection technique used widely in todays computer networks and data storage devices is
based on Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) codes. A systematic CRC encoder takes two binary inputs,
a data word and a generator polynomial, and carries out the necessary calculation to produce the
encoded word.

Your task is to write a program to decode a systematic CRC encoded message. In the case of error
detection your program should return an ERROR message.

Systematic CRC
Given a data word D(x) of length k, a Systematic Encoder generates the encoded data word E(x)

according to the expression:
E(x) = XnkD(x) +R(x)

where n is the size of the encoded message, G(x) is the generator polynomial of length (n k+1) bits,
Xnk is the (n k) term of G(x) and R(x) is the remainder of the modulo-2 division of XnkD(x) by
G(x).

Remark: we can obtain E(x) by shifting the data word that represents D(X) n  k bits to the left
(identical to multiplying it by Xnk), and then adding R(x) (where R(x) is obtained by dividing the
left-shifted word by G(x)).

Example
Let the binary data word 110 represent the original polynomial D(x) = X2+X, and 11101 represent

the generator polynomial G(x) = X4 + X3 + X2 + 1. Thus, 1100000 represents X4D(x) = X6 +
X5, and 1100000 mod 11101=1001 represents the remainder R(x) = X4D(x) mod G(x). Finally,
1100000+1001=1101001 represents the generated encoded word E(x) = X4D(x) +R(x).
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
Three lines containing:

 An integer k representing the length of the original data word (k  16);

 A binary sequence ( string with caracters 0 and 1) representing the encoded message E(x);

 A binary sequence ( string with caracters 0 and 1) representing the generator polynomial G(x).

The binary sequences have maximum length 200.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single line containing the decoded message, or the word ERROR if your
program detects that the given E(x) could not have been generated by the given generator polynomial.
