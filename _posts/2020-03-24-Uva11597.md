title: Uva 11597  Spanning Subtrees
---


## Input

```text
Let Kn denote the complete undirected graph with n vertices where n is an even number. In other
words, Kn is a graph with n vertices where every two vertices are connected. Your task is to find
the maximum number of spanning trees of Kn that can be formed in such a way that no two of these
spanning trees have a common edge.
```

## Output

```text
Each test case will have an even integer n (2  n  400), the number of vertices. The last test case
will be followed by a single 0 denoting end of input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a line in the format, Case X: Y , where X is the case number & Y is the
maximum possible number of spanning trees.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4
0

```
