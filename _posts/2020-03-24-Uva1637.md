## Input

```

Double Patience is a single player game played with a standard 36-card deck. The cards are shuffled
and laid down on a table in 9 piles of 4 cards each, faces up.

After the cards are laid down, the player makes turns. In a turn he can take top cards of the same
rank from any two piles and remove them. If there are several possibilities, the player can choose any
one. If all the cards are removed from the table, the player wins the game, if some cards are still on
the table and there are no valid moves, the player loses.

George enjoys playing this patience. But when there are several possibilities to remove two cards, he
doesnt know which one to choose. George doesnt want to think much, so in such case he just chooses
a random pair from among the possible variants and removes it. George chooses among all possible
pairs with equal probability.

For example, if the top cards are KS, KH, KD, 9H, 8S, 8D, 7C, 7D, and 6H, he removes any
particular pair of (KS, KH), (KS, KD), (KH, KD), (8S, 8D), and (7C, 7D) with the equal probability
of 1/5.

Once Georges friend Andrew came to see him and noticed that he sometimes doesnt act optimally.
George argued, that it is not important  the probability of winning any given patience with his
strategy is large enough.

Help George to prove his statement  given the cards on the table in the beginning of the game,
find out what is the probability of George winning the game if he acts as described.

The input file contains several test cases, each of them consists of nine lines. Each line contains the
description of four cards that form a pile in the beginning of the game, from the bottom card to the
top one.

six, 7 for seven, 8 for eight, 9 for nine, T for ten, J for jack, Q for queen, K for king, and A for
ace. Suits are denoted as S for spades, C for clubs, D for diamonds, and H for hearts. For example,
