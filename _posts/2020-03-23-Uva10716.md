A palindrome is a string of symbols that
is equal to itself when reversed. Given
an input string, not necessarily a palin-
drome, compute the number of swaps
necessary to transform the string into a
palindrome. By swap we mean revers-
ing the order of two adjacent symbols.
For example, the string “mamad” may be
transformed into the palindrome “madam”
with 3 swaps:

• swap “ad” to yield “mamda”

• swap “md” to yield “madma”

• swap “ma” to yield “madam”

## Input
The first line of input gives n, the number
of test cases. For each test case, one line
of input follows, containing a string of up
to 100 lowercase letters.

## Output
Output consists of one line per test case.
This line will contain the number of
swaps, or ‘Impossible’ if it is not pos-
sible to transform the input to a palindrome.

## Sample Input
<p>3</p><p>mamad</p><p>asflkj</p><p>aabb</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>3</p><p>Impossible</p><p>2</p>
