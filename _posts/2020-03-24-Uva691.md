title: Uva 00691  Triangle Partition
---


```
Suppose that a triangle and a number of points inside
the triangle are given. Your job is to find a partition
of the triangle so that the set of the given points are
divided into three subsets of equal size.

Let A, B and C denote the vertices of the trian-
gle. There are n points, P1, P2, ...,Pn, given inside
ABC. You are requested to find a point Q such
that each of the three triangles QBC, QCA and
QAB contains the same number of points. Points
on the boundary line are counted in both triangles.
For example, a point on the line QA is counted in
QCA and also in QAB. If Q coincides a point,
the point is counted in all three triangles.

It can be proved that there always exists a point
Q satisfying the above condition if n = 3  k, with
k = 1, 2, . . . In this problem, n can be any number,
and there will be at least a valid point Q for every
test case. The problem will be easily understood from the figure on the right.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of multiple data sets, each representing a set of points. A data set is given in the
following format.

n
x1 y1
x2 y2
. . .
xn yn

The first integer n is the number of points, such that 1  n  300. The coordinate of a point Pi is
given by (xi, yi). xi and yi are integers between 0 and 1000.

The coordinates of the triangle ABC are fixed. They are A(0, 0), B(1000, 0) and C(0, 1000).

Each of Pi is located strictly inside the triangle ABC, not on the side BC, CA nor AB. No two
points can be connected by a straight line running through one of the vertices of the triangle. Speaking
more precisely, if you connect a point Pi with the vertex A by a straight line, another point Pj never
appears on the line. The same holds for B and C.

The end of the input is indicated by a 0 as the value of n.

```

## Output

```
For each data set, your program should output the coordinate of the point Q. The format of the output
is as follows.

qx qy



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 691  Triangle Partition 2/2

For each data set, a line of this format should be given. No extra lines are allowed. On the contrary,
any number of space characters may be inserted before qx, between qx and qy, or after qy.

Each of qx and qy should be represented by a fractional number (e.g., 3.1415926) but not with an
exponential part (e.g., 6.023e+23 is not allowed). At least seven digits should follow the decimal point.

Note that there is no unique correct answer in this problem. In general, there are infinitely many
points which satisfy the given condition. Your result may be any one of these possible answers.

In your program, you should be careful to minimize the effect of numeric errors in the handling of
floating-point numbers. However, it seems inevitable that some rounding errors exist in the output.
We expect that there is an error of 0.5 104 in the output, and will judge your result accordingly.

Note: As mentioned above, the results shown here are not the only solutions. Many other coordinates
for the point Q are also acceptable.
