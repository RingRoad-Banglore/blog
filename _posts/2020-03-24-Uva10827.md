title: Uva 10827  Maximum sum on a torus
---


## Input

```
A grid that wraps both horizontally and vertically is called a torus.
Given a torus where each cell contains an integer, determine the sub-
rectangle with the largest sum. The sum of a sub-rectangle is the sum
of all the elements in that rectangle. The grid below shows a torus
where the maximum sub-rectangle has been shaded.
```

## Output

```
The first line in the input contains the number of test cases (at most
18). Each case starts with an integer N (1  N  75) specifying the
size of the torus (always square). Then follows N lines describing the
torus, each line containing N integers between -100 and 100, inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a line containing a single integer: the maximum sum of a sub-rectangle within
the torus.
