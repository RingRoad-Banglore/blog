## Input

```text
Two years ago, you helped install the nations very first Flubber pipe network in your hometown, to
great success. Polls show that everyone loves having their own Flubber dispenser in their kitchen, and
now a few enterprising citizens have discovered a use for it. Apparently Flubber, when mixed with
water, can help extinguish fires! This is a very timely discovery, as out-of-control fires have lately been
surprisingly common.

Your hometowns city council would like to make use of this property of Flubber by creating the
Flubber/water mixture at a centrally located station. This station, which is called the Flubber Depart-
ment (FD) will also have specialized employees trained to travel to the locations of fires and make use
of their processed Flubber to control the blazes.

The pipes are already in place all around the city. You are given a layout of the pipes, and must
determine how to route Flubber from the Flubber factory and water from a local source through the
pipes to the FD.

Note that both Flubber and water will be flowing through the same network of pipes, perhaps even
the same pipe. All pipes are bidirectional, but Flubber and water cannot move in opposite directions
through the same pipe. Furthermore, if both liquids are sent in the same direction through the same
pipe, they will inevitably mix. Therefore the nodes in the network have been equipped with special
membranes and filters that enable you to separate and reorganize all incoming mixtures as you see fit.
The network is a closed system, so the total rate of each fluid going into a node must equal the total
rate of that fluid going out, except at the source of that fluid and the destination (the FD).

Each pipe has a certain capacity. Flubber, being somewhat sluggish, has a viscosity value v, so
a pipe that can transport v liters/second of water can transport only 1 liter/second of Flubber. The
pipes capacity scales linearly for mixtures of the two. To be precise, if c denotes the water capacity
of the pipe and f and w are the rates of Flubber and water moving through the pipe (all measured in
liters/second), then the capacity constraint is given by the inequality v  f + w  c.

Your main concern is balancing the mixture that reaches the FD. You would like as much total
liquid as possible, but you also need a sufficient amount of water  because undiluted Flubber is
highly flammable  and a sufficient amount of Flubber  because it would not be much of a Flubber
Department without Flubber! You have come up with a formula to measure the value of the final
mixture: F a W 1a, where F is the rate of incoming Flubber in liters/second, W is the rate of incoming
water in liters/second, and a is a given constant between 0 and 1.

Determine the maximum value of F a  W 1a that can be achieved and how to route the Flubber
and water to achieve it.

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The input starts with a line containing the number of locations n (3  n  200), the number of
pipes p (n1  p  1

2
n(n1)), and the real values v (1  v  10) and a (0.01  a  0.99). Locations

are numbered from 1 to n; 1 is the Flubber factory, 2 is the water source, and 3 is the FD. The real
values have at most 10 digits after the decimal point.

The following p lines each describe one pipe. Each line contains two integers j and k (1  j < k  n),
giving the locations connected by the pipe, and an integer c (1  c  10), giving the water capacity of
the pipe in liters/second.

No two pipes connect the same pair of locations. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that the network is
connected.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.

First, for each pipe (in the order given in the input), display two values: the rate of Flubber moving
through it, and the rate of water moving through it (negative if the liquid is moving from k to j), such
that F a W 1a is maximized. Then display that maximum value accurate to within an absolute error
of 104.

If there are multiple solutions, any one will be accepted. All constraints (not sending Flubber and
water in opposite directions along the same pipe, flow conservation, pipe capacities, and consistency
between the constructed solution and its claimed value) must be satisfied within an absolute error of
104.
