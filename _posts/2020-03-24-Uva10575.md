## Input

```text
Given the vertices of a non-degenerate polygon (no 180-degree angles, zero-length sides, or self-
intersection - but not necessarily convex), you must determine how many distinct lines of symmetry
exist for that polygon. A line of symmetry is one on which the polygon, when reflected on that line,
maps to itself.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of a description of several polygons.

Each polygon description consists of two lines. The first contains the integer n (3  n  1000),
which gives the number of vertices on the polygon. The second contains n pairs of numbers (an x- and
a y-value), describing the vertices of the polygon in order. All coordinates are integers from -1000 to
1000.

Input terminates on a polygon with 0 vertices.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For every polygon described, print out a line saying Polygon #x has y symmetry line(s)., where
x is the number of the polygon (starting from 1), and y is the number of distinct symmetry lines on
that polygon.

```
