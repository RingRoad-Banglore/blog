title: Uva 01600  Patrol Robot
---


```

A robot has to patrol around a rectangular area which is in a form of m  n grid (m rows and n
columns). The rows are labeled from 1 to m. The columns are labeled from 1 to n. A cell (i, j) denotes
the cell in row i and column j in the grid. At each step, the robot can only move from one cell to an
adjacent cell, i.e. from (x, y) to (x + 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x  1, y) or (x, y  1). Some of the cells in the
grid contain obstacles. In order to move to a cell containing obstacle, the robot has to switch to turbo
mode. Therefore, the robot cannot move continuously to more than k cells containing obstacles.

Your task is to write a program to find the shortest path (with the minimum number of cells) from
cell (1, 1) to cell (m,n). It is assumed that both these cells do not contain obstacles.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several data sets. The first line of the input file contains the number of data sets
which is a positive integer and is not bigger than 20. The following lines describe the data sets.

For each data set, the first line contains two positive integer numbers m and n separated by space
(1  m,n  20). The second line contains an integer number k (0  k  20). The i-th line of the next
m lines contains n integer aij separated by space (i = 1, 2, . . . ,m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n). The value of aij is
1 if there is an obstacle on the cell (i, j), and is 0 otherwise.

```

## Output

```
For each data set, if there exists a way for the robot to reach the cell (m,n), write in one line the integer
number s, which is the number of moves the robot has to make; -1 otherwise.
