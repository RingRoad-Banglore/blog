title: Uva 11798  Colorful Board 2
---


## Input

```text
You are given a rectangular board. You are asked to draw M
horizontal lines and N vertical lines in that board, so that the
whole board will be divided into (M +1) (N +1) cells. So there
will be M +1 rows each of which will exactly contain N +1 cells
or columns. The y-th cell of x-th row can be called as cell(x, y).
The distance between two different cells is the summation of row
difference and column difference of those two cells. So the distance
between cell(x1, y1) and cell(x2, y2) is |x1  x2| + |y1  y2|. For
example, the distance between cell(2, 3) and cell(3, 2) is |2 3|+
|3 2| = 1 + 1 = 2.

After that you have to color every cells of the board. For
that you are given K different colors. To make the board more
beautiful you have to make sure that no two adjacent cells contain
the same color, in other word no two cells having the same color
can have the distance 1 in between them. To make the board even
more beautiful you have to make sure no two cells having the same color can have the odd distance
between them. So if you color cell(3, 5) with red, you cannot color cell(5, 8) with red, as the distance
between them is 5, which is odd. Note that you can keep some color unused, but you cant keep some
cell uncolored.
```

## Output

```text
Input will start with an integer T (T  50000) which indicates the number of test cases. Each of the
next T lines will contain three space separated integers M (0  M  19), N (0  N  19) and K
(1  K  50).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a single line in the form Case #: P , where # will be replaced by the case
number and P will be replaced by the number of valid ways you can draw the given board. The result
can be very large you should output the result modulo 1000000007.

```

## Sample Output

0 0 2
5 5 2
5 5 1
