title: Uva 00836  Largest Submatrix
---


## Input

```text
Let A be an N N matrix of zeros and ones. A submatrix S of A is any group of contiguous entries
that forms a square or a rectangle.

Write a program that determines the number of elements of the largest submatrix of ones in A.
Largest here is measured by area.
```

## Output

```text
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The matrix is given line by line. Each line consists of 0s and 1s. The order of the matrix is also
the number of lines input and 1 < N  25.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The output is the number of elements of the largest submatrix found.

```
