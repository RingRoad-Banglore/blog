## Input

```text

XML, eXtensible Markup Language, is poised to become the lingua franca of structured data commu-
nication for the foreseeable future, due in part to its strict formatiing requirements. XML parsers must
report anything that violates the rules of a well-formed XML document. An XML document is said
to be well-formed if it meets all the well-formedness constraints as defined by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) XML specification.

XML documents are composed of units called elements, that contain either character data and/or
other elements. Elements may also contain within their declaration, values called attributes. Consider
the following XML document:

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<customer>

<name>

<first>John</first>

<last>Doe</last>

</name>

<address>

<street>

<number>15</number>

<direction>West</direction>

<name>34th</name>

</street>

<city>New York</city>

<state-code>NY</state-code>

<zip-code format="PLUS4">10001-0001</zip-code>

<country-code>USA</country-code>

</address>

<orders/>

</customer>

The bold identifiers contained within angle brackets are the elements of the document. The italicized
identifer format within the zip-code element is an attribute of that element. All elements, with
the exception of orders, have a start and an end declaration, also called tags. The orders element
is an empty element, as indicated by the /> sequence that closes the element, and does not require a
separate end-tag. The first line is a processing instruction for an XML parser and is not considered an
element of the document.

The rules for a well-formed document are:

1. There is exactly one element that is not contained within any other element. This
element is identified as the root or document element. In the example above, customer is
the document element.

2. The structure of an XML document must nest properly. An elements start-tag must be
paired with a closing end-tag if it is a non-empty element.

3. The name in an elements end-tag must match the element type in the start-tag. For
example, an element opened with <address> must be closed by </address>.

4. No attribute may appear more than once in the same start-tag or empty-element
tag.

5. A parsed element must not contain a recursive reference to itself. For example, it is
improper to include another address element within an address element.

6. A named attributed must have an associated value.
```

## Output

```text
The input will contain a series of XML documents. The start of each document is identified by a
line containing only the processing instruction <?xml version="1.0"?>. The end of the input is
idenitified by a line containing only the text <?end?> (this is not a true XML processing instruction,
just a sentinel used to mark the end of input for this problem). As with all XML documents, white
space between elements and attributes should be ignored. You may make the following assumptions
with regards to the input.

 The only processing instruction that will be present is the XML version processing instruction,
and it will always appear only at the beginning of each document in the input.

 Element and attribute names are case-sensitive. For example, <Address> and <address> are
considered to be different.

 Element and attribute names will use only alpha-numeric characters and the dash, -, character.

 XML comments will not appear in the input.

 Values for attributes will always be properly enclosed in double quotes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input XML document, output a line containing the text well-formed if the document is
well-formed, and non well-formed otherwise.

```

## Sample Output

```text
