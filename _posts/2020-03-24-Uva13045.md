title: Uva 13045  Drawing Polygon
---


## Input

```text
In Euclidean geometry, a regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular (all angles are equal in
measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length). Tara drew a regular convex polygon on a
paper plane. The polygon has N vertices. The lower side of the polygon is parallel to the X-axis. The
lower side is the side having minimum value of (ya + yb) among all sides of that polygon, where ya and
yb are the y coordinate of two different end points of a side. Unfortunately her friend Gudu lost the
paper. Tara only can remember the length of each side L and lower left point P0(x, y) of that polygon.
Help Tara to draw the polygon again.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains a positive integer T ( 20) denoting the number of test cases. Each
of the following T lines contains four integers. N (2 < N  1000), L (0 < L  100), x (|x|  100), y
(|y|  100) as described before.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number in a single line first. Print N points of the polygon in next N
lines. Each point consists of two numbers rounded to six decimal places. Points should be ordered
by counter-clockwise starting from P0. Errors less than 104 will be ignored. Consecutive output set
should be separated by a blank line.

See sample output format.
