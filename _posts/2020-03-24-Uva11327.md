title: Uva 11327  Enumerating Rational Numbers
---


```
Consider the following method of enumerating all rational numbers be-
tween 0 and 1 (inclusively).

for d = 1 to infinity do
for n = 0 to d do

if gcd(n,d) = 1 then print n/d

where gcd(n, d) is the greatest common divisor of n and d.
For example, the start of the sequence looks like:

0/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1/6, 5/6, 1/7, . . .
```

## Input

```
The input consists of a series of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer 1  k 
12, 158, 598, 919. Input is terminated by 0; this case should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the k-th fraction that would be printed by the program above in the format
n/d.

```

## Sample Input

```
1
2
3
12158598919
0

```

## Sample Output

```
0/1
1/1
1/2
199999/200000
```
