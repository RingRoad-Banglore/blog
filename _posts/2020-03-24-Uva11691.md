title: Uva 11691  Allergy Test
---


## Input

```
A test for allergy is conducted over the course of sev-
eral days, and consists of exposing you to different
substances (so called allergens). The goal is to de-
cide exactly which of the allergens you are allergic
to. Each allergen has a live duration D measured in
whole days, indicating exactly how many days you
will suffer from an allergic reaction if you are aller-
gic to that particular substance. An allergic reac-
tion starts to show almost immediately after you have
been exposed to an allergen which you are allergic to.

The test scheme has two action points per day:

1. At 8 oclock each morning, at most one of the allergens is applied to your body.

2. At 8 oclock each evening, you are examined for allergic reactions.

Thus an allergen with live duration D will affect exactly D allergic reaction examinations. Of course, if
you have two or more active allergens in your body at the time of an observed reaction, you cannot tell
from that information only, which of the substances you are allergic to. You want to find the shortest
possible test scheme given the durations of the allergens you want to test. Furthermore, to allow simple
large scale application the test scheme must be non-adaptive, i.e. the scheme should be fixed in advance.
Thus you may not choose when to apply an allergen based on the outcome of previous allergic reaction
examinations.

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N < 30) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

The first line of the input contains a single integer k (1  k  20) specifying the number of allergens
being tested for. Then follow k lines each containing an integer D (1  D  7) specifying the live
duration of each allergen.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print in a single line the number of days of the shortest conclusive non-adaptive test
scheme. A scheme ends the morning when you no longer have active allergens in your body, thus a test
scheme for a single allergen with live duration D takes D days.
