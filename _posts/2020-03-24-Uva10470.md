title: Uva 10470  Shifted Coefficient Number System
---


## Input

```text
Let us define the Shifted Coefficient Number System as a number system that has B base and uses the
coefficients L, L + 1, L + 2,... , L + B  1. As youd soon find out if certain constraints are not met
it would not be possible to express all integers in the SCNS. For this problem youd have to find the
SCNS representation of integers given in Decimal Number System, and when the representation is not
possible youd state so.
```

## Output

```text
There can be multiple test cases. Each test case consists of 3 integers: B, 1 < B < 17 the base for the
number system, L, |L| < 10 the least valued coefficient in the number system and N , |N | < 215  1 a
number given in Decimal Number System.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each of test cases, print two lines. The first line would be of format: CASE# x: where x is the
test case number (starting at 1). In the next line print a SCNS representation of the number in the
following format:

cn Bn cn1 Bn1 . . . c0 B0 = N

If there are multiple solutions print the one that uses the least number of coefficients. For two
numbers in SCNS Pa and Pb, Pa gets preference over Pb when Cai < Cbi, and Cai = Cbi for all
i = n . . . i1. In other words between two representation of a number with same number of coefficients
choose the one that has the smallest most significant digit (if they are equal then the smallest next
significant digit and so on...).

None of the representations should use more than 15 coefficients. If it is not possible to
represent the number in SCNS with 15 or less coefficients, then print the words NOT REPRESENTABLE.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2 0 5
2 1 5
2 2 5

```
