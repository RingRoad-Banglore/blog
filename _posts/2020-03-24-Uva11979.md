## Input

```text
You are given N integers in base-N each of them having exactly M digits (may be with some leading
zeros). Two integers are called K-similar if they have the same digits in exactly K positions. For
example 321 and 213 are 0-similar. 3456 and 6453 are 2-similar, 123 and 453 are 1-similar. You want
to change these given N -integers in such a way that each pair of these integers are 0-similar. To achieve
this goal you can change the integers in several steps. In a single step you can change a single digit of
a single integer by 1 (incrementing or decrementing). But you cant decrement if the digit is 0 or you
cant increment if the digit is N  1.

You need to achieve your goal in minimum number of steps.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 50), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing two integers N (2  N  2000) and M (1  M  10). Each
of the next N lines contains M integers between 0 and N  1 inclusive. These M integers form an M
digit number in base N .

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number and the minimal steps required to achieve your goal.

```

## Sample Output

```text

0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
4 2
