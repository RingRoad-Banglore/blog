title: Uva 12374  Treasure Hunt

## Input

```
You have to help a group courageous people to
find the lost treasure of your country, like the
movie National Treasure - Book of Se-
crets. To discover the national treasure that
courageous group has to pass through many
traps, solve many riddles and so on.

Like the film there are four people in the
group and to reach the treasure they have to
jump on a plate that is placed on a pillar with
sharp edge at the top. Before any of them
jumps on the plate, it is in a stable position.
For simplicity you can assume that the plate is
rectangular in shape, has equal thickness at all
places, it is solid and made of same material.
Four people of equal weight jump on the plate
at the same time but they can jump only at
some certain points of the plate. So they can-
not always jump in such a way that the plate
is stable after they jump on it. Therefore after
jumping on the plate they must run and change their position to make the plate stable again.

After jumping on the rectangular plate the four
people can run at any direction they want.

Given the shape of the plate (always rect-
angular) and location of the four people just
after jumping on it, your job is to find the min-
imum distance they have to cover in total to
make the plate stable again. After jumping the
four people can run towards any direction. You
dont need to print the minimum distance, but
you need to print the final position of the four
people after covering the minimum distance in
total.

## Output

```
The input file contains around 15000 sets of in-
puts. Each set is described with 16 floating-
point numbers scattered in two lines. The
first line contains eight floating-point numbers
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4 and y4 (10 
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4  1010) that denotes
the coordinates of the four people just after

jumping on the plate. So the coordinate of the four people are (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) and (x4, y4)
respectively. The second line contains another eight floating-point numbers x5, y5, x6, y6, x7, y7, x8,
y8 (10  x  5, y5, x6, y6, x7, y7, x8, y8  1010). These eight floating-point numbers actually denote
the coordinates of the four corners of the plate in counter clockwise order. The shape of the plate is
always rectangular. You can assume that the jumping locations (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) and (x4, y4)
are strictly within the plate boundary and all four people have equal weight. Input is terminated by

two lines, each containing eight zeroes. All floating-point numbers in the input has twelve digits after
the decimal point. The coordinates are all in two dimensions so they actually are given to specify the
size and orientation of the plate and the location of the people with respect to the plate. So if a person
stands still on the plate and the plate moves up and down or rotates, the coordinates of the person or
coordinate of four corners of the plate does not change. In the sample input it is shown that each line
contains four floating-point numbers. But it is only for lack of horizontal space on paper. In the judge
input file there are eight floating-point numbers in each line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input produce four lines of output. Each line contains two floating-point numbers that
denote the final position of one of the four persons. The final position of the four persons should be
mentioned according to the same order given in the input and should make the plate stable. Also the
final position of all four persons must be inside (or on the boundary of) the plate as well and ensure
that the total movement made by the four persons is minimum. If there is more than one solution,
any one will do. All floating-point numbers in the output should contain 12 digits after the decimal
point. Print a blank line after output for each set. There is an special judge for this program, so small
precision error will be ignored.
