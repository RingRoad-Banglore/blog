title: Uva 12718  Dromicpalin Substrings
---


```

Lets first define some terms:

 A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward. Examples of palindromes are
madam and toot.

 A string is a dromicpalin if we can rearrange its letters to make it a palindrome. An example of
a dromicpalin string is mmaad because we can rearrange the letters to make it madam, which
is a palindrome.

 A substring is any contiguous sequence of characters of a string. Some substrings of acmicpc are
a, c, i, icp, acmicpc but acpc is not a substring. For this problem, we are not considering
the empty substring, so that means there are n(n+ 1) over2 substrings of a string of length n.

Given a string, you have to figure out how many of its substrings are dromicpalin.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 100) indicating the number of test cases. Each case is a line
containing a string. The strings will contain only lowercase letters [a - z]. The length of each string
will be positive and not greater than 1000.

```

## Output

```
For each case, first output the case number followed by the number of substrings that are dromicpalin.
Follow the samples for exact format. There is no new-line between cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
4

```

## Sample Output

```

Case 1: 8

Case 2: 15

Case 3: 24

Case 4: 67
