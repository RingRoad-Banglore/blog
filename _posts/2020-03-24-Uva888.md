## Input

```text
Long ago, a number of farmers wanted to sell their donkeys. These farmers lived in a small village and
the marketplace was in the capital. There was only one small road from the village the farmers lived
in to the capital, and one day the farmers left for the long journey towards the capital. Every farmer
wanted to travel as fast as possible to be the first to sell his donkey, but there was one major problem:
the donkeys were very stubborn; everytime a donkey reached a river there was a chance that he would
stay there for some time, not willing to cross the river. However, two donkeys never rested at the same
river.

The game Donkey is derived from this legend: N players (numbered from 1 . . . N) start with their
donkey in the village. Between the village and the capital are M rivers. The players take turns in
throwing a fair, 6-sided die and move their donkey the thrown number of rivers towards the capital.
Since only one donkey can rest at a river, the donkey is placed at the next free river if necessary. After
player 1 has thrown the die, it is player 2s turn, etc. After N comes 1. The player that passes all rivers
first wins the game.

This is an example of a Donkey gameboard, where N = 2 and M = 6. Player 1s donkey is located
at river 4 and player 2s donkey is located at river 1.

Your task is to give the probability that player 1 wins the game, given a certain board position.

## Output

```text
The first line contains a single integer which equals the number of test cases that follow. Each of the
following lines contains one test case. The first integer on a line gives the number of rivers M , the
second integer gives the number of players N (1  N  4 and N M  50). Then follow N integers
Pi (0  Pi  M , 1  i  N), representing the position of the i-th player. The river closest to the
village has number 1, the river closest to the capital has number M . The village has number 0. Two
donkeys may not be positioned at the same river. However, more than one donkey may be standing in
the village. The last integer on the line gives the player, whose turn it is.

the second, ) and the probability player 1 wins with an accuracy of 3 decimals:

Game N:the probability that player 1 wins = D.DDD
