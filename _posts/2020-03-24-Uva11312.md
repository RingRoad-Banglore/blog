title: Uva 11312  Flipping Frustration
---


```
Wolfgang Puck is not doing so well financially and has accepted a po-
sition as a lowly chef at a restaurant franchise named after himself. He
is not able to live his normal, lavish lifestyle and as a result he has
recently developed some odd tendencies. One tendency in particular is
that with his recipe books he can only flip a precise number of pages
left (backwards) or a number of pages right (forwards).

Wolfgang must make a dish he knows to be on a certain page of his
recipe book. If he starts from the first page, is he able to reach this
page? If so, what is the least number of page flips he can make to reach
this page?
```

## Input

```
On the first line you are given c (1  c  100), the number of occurrences Wolfgang has with his
flipping frustration. For each occurrence you are given n l r t (2  n  107, 1  l, r  n1, 1  t  n)
on a line where n is the number of pages in the book, l is the interval left, r is the interval right, and t
is the target page number.

```

## Output

```
If it is possible to reach page t from page 1, output on a single line the minimum number of page flips.
If it is not possible, print uh-oh! on a line.

```
