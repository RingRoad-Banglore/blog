title: Uva 13120  Radiation Alert in Rabbitland
---


```
A radiation source was recently discovered by some scientists of Rabbitland while they were digging
a burrow. Immediately, King Rabbit ordered the reinforcement of Rabbitlands boundary using lead
barriers, and the installation of some additional lead barriers inside Rabbitland. Rabbitlands boundary
is defined with a polygon, and each lead barrier is described with a line segment.

Each lead barrier blocks the radiation, protecting some regions inside Rabbitland. You have been
hired by King Rabbit to calculate the percentage of Rabbitlands territory that is being irradiated by
the radiation source.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two blank-separated integers
N and M , where N is the number of vertices of the polygon describing the boundary of Rabbitland
(3  N  16), and M is the number of additional barriers installed inside Rabbitland (0  M  20).
The second line of a test case contains two blank-separated integers xS and yS (0  xS , yS  25)
indicating the position (xS , yS) where the radiation source was discovered. Then follow N lines: line i
contains exactly two blank-separated integers xi and yi, where (xi, yi) is the position of the i-th vertex
of the polygon describing the boundary of Rabbitland (0  xi, yi  25). Finally follow M lines: line
j contains exactly four blank-separated integers x1j , y1j , x2j and y2j , where (x1j , y1j) and (x2j , y2j)
are the positions of the endpoints of the line segment that describes the j-th additional lead barrier
installed inside Rabbitland (0  x1j , y1j , x2j , y2j  25, (x1j , y1j) = (x2j , y2j)). You may assume that
the radiation source and every lead barrier are completely inside the polygon including its boundary.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a single line with a number indicating the percentage of Rabbitlands territory
that is being irradiated by the radiation source, followed by the percentage sign (%). The answer should
be formatted and approximated to three decimal places. The floating point delimiter must be . (i.e.,
the dot). The rounding applies towards the nearest neighbor unless both neighbors are equidistant, in
which case the result is rounded up (e.g., 78.3712 is rounded to 78.371; 78.5766 is rounded to 78.577;
78.3745 is rounded to 78.375, etc.).
