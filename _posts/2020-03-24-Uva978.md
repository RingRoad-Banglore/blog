## Input

```text

Oh no... more lemmings!! And in Lemmings Planet a huge battle
is being fought between the two great rival races: the green lem-
mings and the blue lemmings. Everybody was now assigned to bat-
tle and they will fight until one of the races completely dissapears:
the Deadly War has begun!

Every single lemming has a power measure that describes its
ability to fight. When two single lemmings fight with each one, the
lemming with more power survives and the other one dies. However,
the power of the living lemming gets smaller after the fight, exactly
in the value of the power of the lemming that died. For example, if
we have a green lemming with power 50 and a blue lemming with
power 40, the blue one dies and the green one survives, but having
only power 10 after the battle (50-40=10). If two lemmings have the
same power when they fight, both of them die.

In the fight between the two races, there are a certain number of battlefields. Each race assigns one
lemming for each battlefield, starting with the most powerful. So for example, if a race has 5 lemmings
with power 50 50 40 40 30 and we have 3 battlefields, then a lemming with power 50 will be assigned
to battlefield 1, another with 50 power will be assigned to battlefield 2 and last a lemming with power
40 will go to battlefield 3. The other race will do the same.

The Deadly War is processed by having each race send its best soldiers as described to the battle-
fields, making a battle round. Then, all battles process at the same time, and some of the lemmings
will emerge victorious (but with less power) and some of them will die. The surviving ones will return
to their races army and then a new round will begin, with each race sending again its best remaining
soldiers to the battlefields. If at some point a race does not have enough soldiers to fill all battlefields,
then only the ones with soldiers from both races will have a fight.

The Deadly War ends when one of the races has no more lemmings or when both of them disappear
at the same time. For example, imagine a war with 2 battlefields and a green army with powers 20
10 and a blue army with powers 10 10 15. The first round will have 20 vs 15 in battlefield 1 and 10
vs 10 in battlefield 2. After these battles, green race will still have a power 5 lemming (that won on
battlefield 1) and blue race will have one with power 10 (that did not fight). The ones in battlefield 2
died, since they both had the same power. Afer that comes a second round, and only battlefield 1 will
have a fight, being 5 vs 10. The blue lemming wins, killing the last green soldier and giving the victory
do the blue race!

But in the real battle, will victory be green or blue?

Given the number of battefields and the armies of both races, your task is to discover which race
will win the Deadly War and show the power of the surviving soldiers.

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains a single number N , representing the number of test cases that follow
(1  N  100).

Each test case starts with a line with three space-separated integers, B, SG and SB, representing
respectively the number of battlefields available, the number of lemmings in the green army and the
number of lemmings in the blue army (1  B,SG, SB  100000).

Than follow exactly SG lines, each one with an integer indicating the power of one single lemming
of the green army, followed by SB lines, each one with an integer indicating the power of one single
lemming of the blue army. This power is a positive integer smaller than 101.

The lemmings in each army do not need to come in any particular order.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case you should print:

 green and blue died if both races died in the same round

 green wins if the green army won the Deadly War, followed by one line for each surviving
soldier (in descending order)

 blue wins if the blue army won the Deadly War, followed by one line for each surviving soldier
(in descending order)

There should also be a blank line beetween test cases.
