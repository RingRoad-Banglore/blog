Flood-it is a fascinating puzzle game on Google+ platform. The game interface is like follows:

At the beginning of the game, system will randomly generate an N N square board and each grid
of the board is painted by one of the six colors. The player starts from the top left corner. At each
step, he/she selects a color and changes all the grids connected with the top left corner to that specific
color. The statement two grids are connected means that there is a path between the certain two
grids under condition that each pair of adjacent grids on this path is in the same color and shares an
edge. In this way the player can flood areas of the board from the starting grid (top left corner) until
all of the grids are in same color. The following figure shows the earliest steps of a 4 4 game (colors
are labeled in 0 to 5):

Given a colored board at very beginning, please find the minimal number of steps to win the game
(to change all the grids into a same color).
