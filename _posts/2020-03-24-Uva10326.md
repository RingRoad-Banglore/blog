title: Uva 10326  The Polynomial Equation
---


## Input

```text
A Polynomial equation of degree n is defined as follows :

C0 +

n
i=1

(Ci  xi) = 0.

A polynomial equation of n degree can have at most n distinct roots which may be both real or
complex. Such as a quadratic equation :

x2  5x+ 6 = 0

has two roots 2 and 3. In this problem you have to generate such a polynomial equation whose roots
are already given.
```

## Output

```text
The input will start with a positive integer N indicating the number of roots of the polynomial equation.
The next line will contain the roots each of which is an integer. N will not exceed 50.

Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```text
You have to show the polynomial using x as a variable. If coefficient of any term xi (i > 0) becomes
zero then you need not show that term. In case of coeffecient being 1 only print x^i (i > 0). Again if
the constant term is zero always use + 0. See sample output for more clarification.

You can be sure that no coeffecient will exceed 1015.

```

## Sample Output
