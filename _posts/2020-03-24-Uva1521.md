title: Uva 01521  GCD Guessing Game
---


```

Paul had a birthday yesterday, and they were playing a guessing game there with Andrew: Andrew
was trying to guess Pauls age. Andrew knew that Pauls age is an integer between 1 and n, inclusive.
Andrew can guess any number x between 1 and n, and Paul will tell him what is the greatest common
divisor of x and his age.

Heres a possible course of the game for n = 6. Andrew starts with guessing 3, and Paul replies that
the greatest common divisor of 3 and his age is 1. That means that Pauls age cant be 3 or 6, but can
still be 1, 2, 4 or 5. Andrew continues with guessing 2, and Paul replies 2. That means that Pauls age
cant be 1 or 5, and the only two remaining choices are 2 and 4. Finally, Andrew guesses 4, and Paul
replies 2. That means that Pauls age is 2, and the game is over.

Andrew needed three guesses in the above example, but its possible to always determine Pauls age
in at most two guesses for n = 6. The optimal strategy for Andrew is: at the first step, guess 6. If Paul
says 1, then its 1 or 5 and he can check which one by guessing 5. If Paul says 2, then its 2 or 4, and
he can check by guesing 4 as weve seen above. If Paul says 3, then we already know the answer is 3.
Finally, if Paul says 6, the answer is 6.

What is the number of guesses required in the worst case if Andrew guesses optimally for the given
n?
