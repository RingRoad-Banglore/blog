title: Uva 13078  Feeding chicks
---


```
The chicks spend all day pecking at the floor of the
henhouse to eat the grain they find. Youve been sev-
eral days observing their movements and have found
that they all follow a curious pattern based on the
tiles in the floor. They wake up looking in one di-
rection (north, south, east, west) and start walking
in that direction following a clockwise spiral move-
ment. The ride ends when they get tired (each chick
has a different endurance) or run into the edge of the
henhouse, where they are stunned and sleep until the
next day.

For each tile they pass (including the one where
they wake up) if there is a grain, they eat it before
taking the next step. If there is no grain, they just
keep moving forward. Since they are small, when they
come together on one point, they eat at the same time without bothering each other and sometimes
even sleep in the same place.

To get your chicks grow as quickly as possible without overspend, you decided to distribute the
grains in the henhouse so that in every step each chick finds a grain and can eat it. You know the
direction in which the chicks wake up, and the number of steps they can take in the spiral before getting
tired and stop until the next day. Now you must find the grains that you have to place at each point
so that, at the end of the day, none is left and all chicks have eaten as much as possible.

## Input

```
The input begins with the number of test cases to be processed. Each case begins with three numbers,
r, c and n meaning, respectively, the size of the chicken coop in the north-south direction, the size in the
east-west direction and the number of chicks (1  r, c  50; 0  n  500). The next n lines contain the
chicks information. The first number, v, means the position in the north-south direction (1  v  r),
the second, h, the position in the east-west direction (1  h  c), next it is the start direction of the
chick (N , S, E, W ) and finally the maximum number of steps before falling sleep (at least one).

```

## Output

```
For each test case r lines are written. In each line c values separated by a blank are written, showing
the number of grains needed in each point. After each test case write three scripts (---).
