title: Uva 11927  Games Are Important

```
One of the primary hobbies (and research topics!)
among Computing Science students at the University
of Alberta is, of course, the playing of games. Peo-
ple here like playing games very much, but the prob-
lem is that the games may get solved completelyas
happened in the case of Checkers. Generalization of
games is the only hope, but worries that they will
be solved linger still. Here is an example of a gen-
eralization of a two player game which can also be
solved.

Suppose we have a directed acyclic graph with
some number of stones at each node. Two players
take turns moving a stone from any node to one of its neighbours, following a directed edge. The player
that cannot move any stone loses the game. Note that multiple stones may occupy the same node at
any given time.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of a number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers
n and m, the number of nodes and the number of edges respectively. (1  n  1000, 0  m  10000).
Then, m lines follow, each containing two integers a and b: the starting and ending node of the edge
(nodes are labeled from 0 to n 1).

The test case is terminated by n more integers s0, . . . , sn1 (one per line), where si represents the
number of stones that are initially placed on node i (0  si  1000).

Each test case is followed by a blank line, and input is terminated by a line containing 0 0 which
should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output a single line with either the word First if the first player will win, or the
word Second if the second player will win (assuming optimal play by both sides).
