11827 Maximum GCD
Given the N integers, you have to find the maximum GCD (greatest common divisor) of every possible
pair of these integers.

## Input
The first line of input is an integer N (1 < N < 100) that determines the number of test cases.

The following N lines are the N test cases. Each test case contains M (1 < M < 100) positive
integers that you have to find the maximum of GCD.

## Output
For each test case show the maximum GCD of every possible pair.

## Sample Input
<p>3</p><p>10 20 30 40</p><p>7 5 12</p><p>125 15 25</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>20</p><p>1</p><p>25</p>
