## Input

```text
The problem statement is very easy. Given a number n you have to determine the largest power of m,
not necessarily prime, that divides n!.
```

## Output

```text
The input file consists of several test cases. The first line in the file is the number of cases to handle.
The following lines are the cases each of which contains two integers m (1 < m < 5000) and n
(0 < n < 10000). The integers are separated by an space. There will be no invalid cases given
and there are not more that 500 test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case in the input, print the case number and result in separate lines. The result is either an
integer if m divides n! or a line Impossible to divide (without the quotes). Check the sample input
and output format.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
2 10
