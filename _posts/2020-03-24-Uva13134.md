title: Uva 13134  Generate Sort and Search

## Input

```
We have the following recursive function:

f(1) = x
f(n) = (a  f(n 1) + c) mod m, with n  2, n  ZZ+

Remember that the operation mod calculates the remainder of the integer division.
With the previous recursive function you should generate a sequence containing the first n elements,

which are: f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), . . . , f(n). Then, you should sort those numbers in ascending order
(with respect to its value), so you can tell which number is located in the i-th position of the sorted
sequence.
```

## Output

```
There are several test cases. The first line of each test case has six integer numbers: a, c, m, x, q, n
separated by spaces (2  a < m, 0  c < m, 3  m  103, 0  x < m, 1  q  104, 1  n  108). The
remaining lines of each test case have q integer numbers. Each one corresponds to the position in the
sorted sequence whose value wants to be known.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each query you should print a single line containing the integer number in the i-th position of the
sorted sequence.

```

## Sample Output

```
7 4 9 3 5 10
2
10
3
9
4

```
