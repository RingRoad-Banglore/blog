title: Uva 00885  Telephone Directory Alphabetization
---


```
Based on its success in contracting previous software development efforts to programming contest
teams, the String & Tin Can (S&TC) Telephone Company has now decided to produce its telephone
directories internally. Your team has been hired to develop a program that will take subscriber names
and telephone numbers and alphabetize them into a list for printing.

Telephone directories have traditionally used special conventions for alphabetization, and S&TC
wants your program to use these conventions. Each subscriber listing consists of one or more words,
where each word is separated from the others by spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. Directories
only use the letters A through Z for sorting, ignoring case. Therefore, names that include words
comprised of digits or capital letters require special processing.

A listing may contain a word that is a decimal number. Listings with numbers in them appear in
the alphabetized list in the same location they would if the numbers were spelled out in English. For
example, 50 Star Company might appear just before Fifty Star Vending in the list. Numbers are
permitted to be in the range 0-999,999,999. Letters and digits will not appear together in the same
word.

All special (non-alphanumeric) characters are to be treated as spaces. Penny-Wise Corporation
would appear after Penny Saver, but before Pennypinching Company. Multiple spaces or non-
alphanumeric characters are treated as a single space when sorting. Special characters will not appear
at the beginning of a listing.

Words that are comprised of all capital letters are assumed to be initials or acronyms, and are
treated as if spaces appeared between each letter. Hence, KAT Shop would appear at the beginning
of the K listings, before K-B Enterprises and K Warehouse.
```

## Input

```
Input to your program will be a list of subscribers, one per line. The first seven digits will be the
telephone number, and the rest of the line will be the name of the subscriber as it is to appear in the
telephone directory.

```

## Output

```
Your program is to alphabetically sort the subscriber names according to the rules above and print the
listing in order. Each line should contain the subscriber name as it appeared in the input in the first
52 positions, left justified and space filled, followed by the seven digit telephone number (including a
space between the third and fourth digits) in columns 56 through 63. The telephone number is to be
immediately followed by the end of line.

Your program need not handle more than 1,000 subscribers-none of the towns S&TC serves in
Swamp County have populations larger than that.
