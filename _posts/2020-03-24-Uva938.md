title: Uva 00938  Gilix
---


## Input

```text

Gilix, a mythical character, was the official messenger of the Tagusland king because he was known to
transport a message between any two points in the fastest possible way. Until recently, few knew that
his speed was the combination of his wisdom with a magical potion that he had created and personally
prepared. After drinking his potion, he could travel twice as fast as he would usually do until he reached
his destination. Unfortunately, the ingredients for cooking the potion could only be found in places
with rare weather conditions and they should be used immediately or they would loose their magical
power.

Based on the given legend, a software house has decided to create a computer game where the hero,
Gilix, transports a message between two points in a map.

Every map is composed of a cylindrical grid of hexagons, with coordinates as represented in the
following figure. In cylindrical grids, the leftmost hexagons are adjacent to the rightmost ones. For
example, from the hexagon with coordinates (0,0), Gilix can move to the hexagons (0,1), (1,0), (1,7),
and (0,7). From the hexagon with coordinates (1,7), Gilix can move to the hexagons (0,7), (0,0), (1,0),
(2,0), (2,7), and (1,6).

Each hexagon has its own type of terrain, which is characterised by a positive even integer, called
the standard cost of the hexagon. From a given hexagon, Gilix can move to any adjacent hexagon
spending a number of time units that depends on the standard cost of the destination hexagon. The
number of time units is:

 the standard cost (of the destination hexagon), if Gilix has not drunk the potion;

 half of the standard cost (of the destination hexagon), if Gilix has already drunk the potion.

As in the legend, Gilix can prepare and drink his magic potion only once and in a unique hexagon of
the map. Assume that, when Gilix reaches that hexagon, he can prepare and drink the potion without
spending any time unit.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 938  Gilix 2/2

Given a map (composed of a cylindrical grid of hexagons, with their standard costs), the origin and
the destination of the travel, and the place where Gilix can prepare and drink the potion, compute the
minimum number of time units Gilix needs to perform the mission.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains a pair of integers, L and C, separated by a space:

 L (1  L  300) is the number of lines in the map;

 C (1  C  300) is the number of columns in the map.

The following L lines contain a representation of the map from top to bottom. Each line contains
C positive even integers, separated by a space, which represent the standard costs of the hexagons on
that line (from left to right). No standard cost exceeds 30.

Each of the following three lines contains two integers, X and Y , separated by a space, which
identify the coordinates of a hexagon in the map:

 X is the line number (0  X < L); and

 Y is the column number (0  Y < C).

The first line specifies the initial position of Gilix, the second line specifies his final destination, and
the third line indicates the place where the magic potion can be prepared and drunk.

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of one single line that contains the minimum number of time units necessary to
travel from the initial to the final position.
