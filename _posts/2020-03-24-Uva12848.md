## Input

```text

To the right: London towers clock

While Whittington is busy with his cat, the small boy asks the
princess: if it takes six seconds for the clock to strike six, how
long would it take to strike twelve?

Every hour the tower clock sounds a large bell as many
times as the number of hours it is marking. So, for example,
at 6 oclock it sounds the bell six times. The time it takes to
complete this task is counted from the moment it hits the bell
the frst time until the moment it hits it the last time. The
time between consecutive strikes is always constant.

You know that at hour H1 it takes the clock exactly S sec-
onds to strike H1. How long would it take to strike a diferent
hour H2?
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases.

Each test case is described by three integer numbers in a single line, in order: H1, S, H2.

T  5000; 2  H1,H2  12; 0 < S < 60; H1 = H2

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the exact number of seconds that the clock takes
to mark H2.

If this number is not an integer, and is less than 1, then print it as a simplifed fraction p/q (that is,
p and q have to be coprimes).

If the answer is not an integer, and is greater than 1, then print it as a mixed number, with its
fraction part simplifed. See the samples below for the formatting details.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
6 6 12
6 6 11
3 1 2

```
