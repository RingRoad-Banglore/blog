title: Uva 10216  The Optimal Coffee Shop
---


```
In Bangladesh there are many private Universities now. Almost all of them dont have their own
campuses (by campus I mean a large area consisting many buildings) and at their present locations
(two busy areas of Dhaka Banani, Mohakhali) it is not possible for them to have their own campus
covering large area like the Public Universities (Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology,
Dhaka University, Jahangir Nagar University etc). So three Private Universities in Dhaka (North
South University, East West University & BRAC University (Sorry! There is no Up Down University))
decide to move away from their current location to a large vacant plain field in Savar (Another place
near Dhaka). This field is so large (the Bangladeshi people can consider it like the field of Tepantor
described in fairytales) that the campuses of these Universities can be considered as points (You know
better than me, that if I dont consider them as points this problem will be even harder).

These Universities decide to build a common coffee shop for their students, but the problem is
that everyone wants the coffee shop to be established in their own campus. At last they decided that
the coffee shop would be established in a place whose total distance from these three Universities is
minimum. For the convenience of you & me I would like you to find this total minimum distance (if
the campuses are A, B, C and the optimal location is P find PA+PB+PC). One of the Universities
proposed the coffee shop to be on the in-center of triangle ABC (Lets say the in-center is I), another
proposed it to be on the Center of Gravity of triangle ABC (Lets say the center of Gravity is G) and
the other proposed it to be on the circum-center of the triangle (Lets say the circum-center is O). So
you will also need to print the value of (AI +BI +CI), the value of (AG+BG+CG) and the value of
(AO+BO+CO). If any value cannot be determined print its value as 1 with appropriate formatting.

/* In the paragraph above only but the names and current locations of the Universities are true. */

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer S (0 < S  100) that indicates how many sets of
inputs are there. Each of the next S lines contains 1 set of input. Each set contains three integer
numbers a, b, c where a is the distance between B & C, b is the distance between C & A and c is the
distance between A & B. The important condition is (0 < a, b, c  10000). As you already know A, B,
C are the locations of the three campuses.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input you should output four floating-point numbers DM , DI, DG, DO, all of which
have three digits after the decimal point. Here DM = AP + BP + CP , DI = AI + BI + CI,
DG = AG+BG+ CG, DO = AO +BO + CO.
