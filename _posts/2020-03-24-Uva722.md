## Input

```text
A region of two-dimensional space is divided by a grid into uniform square cells, each of which represents
either land or water.

We are interested in finding the area of a region of horizontally or vertically connected water cells
totally enclosed by a boundary of land cells, given the location of a water cell in the region.

Choose a representation, such as a two-dimensional array, in which the basic operations available
are to determine whether a cell is land or water, and to move from a cell to any of its neighbors.
Assume that you are given the location of an arbitrary water cell in the region whose area is required.

Since the area of the water region is defined to be the number of cells in it, the most straightforward
way to compute the area is to simply count the number of cells in it. Write a program to do this.

The following restrictions and assumptions apply:

 the grid, G[1..M, 1..N ], is rectangular and is no larger than 99 by 99.

 an input of 0 (zero) represents water.

 an input of 1 represents land.

 there may be more than one body of water.

 the input is assumed to be surrounded by a border of land (1s)
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input is an integer M , then a blank line followed by M datasets, each of them as
described below. There is a blank line between datasets.

line 1 - two integers i, j separated by 1 blank which represents the position (row, column) of a water
cell in the region whose area is to be determined. The input integers will be in character form;
two non-blank characters followed by a blank followed by two more characters with the characters
in {0, 1, ..., 9}.

line 2 - the first row of the grid ( 99 characters, all 1s or 0s) where the first character represents
G[1, 1], the second G[1, 2], the third G[1, 3], ...

line 3 - the second row of the grid ( 99 characters, all 1s or 0s) where the first character represents
G[2, 1], the second G[2, 2], the third G[2, 3], ...

remaining lines for the remaining rows of the grid.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each dataset, display on the screen one integer which is the area of the enclosed area of water. Print
a blank line between datasets.
