title: Uva 10356  Rough Roads
---


## Input

```text
After he bought the tri-cycle last year, Shaon went to visit his grandfathers house in a remote part
of Bangladesh. He wanted to ride the cycle in quiet, rush-free rural roads. But when he reached the
gate of the village of his grandfather, his found his plan useless. The roads are too rough to ride the
cycle comfortably. If he rides the cycle from one junction to another, his toe would become too tired
to push the paddles in the next part of his journey. He just has to carry the cycle on his back to reach
next junction. After that, he will be able to ride the bike again. This would go on until he reaches his
grandfathers house. But he doesnt want to knock his grandfathers door with a cycle on his back. So
he must travel the last road riding the cycle. He also decided to start his journey by carrying the cycle
on his back, not by riding it.

Can you find out the shortest way to reach his grandfathers house?

## Output

```text
Input consists of several datasets and is terminated by end of file. The first line of each test case
contains two integers: n (the number of junctions, 1 < n < 501) and r (the number of bi-directional
roads connecting these junctions). The junctions are numbered with 0, 1, . . . , n  1. The gate of the
village and the grandfathers house is situated at junctions 0 and n  1 respectively. Each of the
next r lines (one for each road) contains three non-negative integers: two junction-numbers that the
corresponding road connects and the length of the road in kilometers. A road always connects two
different junctions. Length of a road is not more than 20km and not less than 1km.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each dataset, print the set number (1, 2, . . .) in a line followed by the length of the shortest path.
However, if it is not possible to reach there in the specified way, print a ?.
