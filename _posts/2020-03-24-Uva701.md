title: Uva 00701  The Archeologists Dilemma
---


```
An archeologist seeking proof of the presence of extraterrestrials in the Earths past, stumbles upon a
partially destroyed wall containing strange chains of numbers. The left-hand part of these lines of digits
is always intact, but unfortunately the right-hand one is often lost by erosion of the stone. However,
she notices that all the numbers with all its digits intact are powers of 2, so that the hypothesis that
all of them are powers of 2 is obvious. To reinforce her belief, she selects a list of numbers on which it
is apparent that the number of legible digits is strictly smaller than the number of lost ones, and asks
you to find the smallest power of 2 (if any) whose first digits coincide with those of the list.

Thus you must write a program such that given an integer, it determines (if it exists) the smallest
exponent E such that the first digits of 2E coincide with the integer (remember that more than half of
the digits are missing).
```

## Input

```
It is a set of lines with a positive integer N not bigger than 2147483648 in each of them.

```

## Output

```
For every one of these integers a line containing the smallest positive integer E such that the first digits
of 2E are precisely the digits of N , or, if there is no one, the sentence no power of 2.
