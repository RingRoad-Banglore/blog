```
Another tale of lumberjacks?. Let see 

The lumberjacks are rude, bearded workers, while foremen tend to be bossy and simpleminded.
The foremen like to harass the lumberjacks by making them line up in groups of ten, ordered by the
length of their beards. The lumberjacks, being of different physical heights, vary their arrangements to
confuse the foremen. Therefore, the foremen must actually measure the beards in centimeters to see if
everyone is lined up in order.

Your task is to write a program to assist the foremen in determining whether or not the lumberjacks
are lined up properly, either from shortest to longest beard or from longest to shortest.
