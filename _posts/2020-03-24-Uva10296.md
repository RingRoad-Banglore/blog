title: Uva 10296  Jogging Trails
---


## Input

```text
Gord is training for a marathon. Behind his house is
a park with a large network of jogging trails connect-
ing water stations. Gord wants to find the shortest
jogging route that travels along every trail at least
once.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. The first line
of input for each case contains two positive integers:
n  15, the number of water stations, and m < 1000,
the number of trails. For each trail, there is one subse-
quent line of input containing three positive integers:
the first two, between 1 and n, indicating the water
stations at the end points of the trail; the third indicates the length of the trail, in cubits. There may
be more than one trail between any two stations; each different trail is given only once in the input;
each trail can be travelled in either direction. It is possible to reach any trail from any other trail by
visiting a sequence of water stations connected by trails. Gords route may start at any water station,
and must end at the same station. A single line containing 0 follows the last test case.
