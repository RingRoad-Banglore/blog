title: Uva 11601  Avoiding Overlaps
---


## Input

```
Given N regular rectangles in a sequence. Following this sequence you have to draw every rectangles if
it does not overlap with any rectangle which has been drawn already. Calculate the total area of drawn
rectangles.

Note: A rectangle is regular if and only if its sides are all parallel to the axis.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T (1  T  100). Each case starts with
a single line containing N (0  N  10000), the number of rectangles in the sequence. Next N lines
will represent the sequence of rectangles. Each of the next N lines will represent one rectangle having
four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 (100 < x1, y1, x2, y2 < 100, x1 < x2, y1 < y2), here (x1, y1) is the lower left
corner of the rectangle and (x2, y2) is the upper right corner of the rectangle.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and a single integer, the total area covered by rectangles you
drew.

```

## Sample Output

```
1
3
-1 -1 1 1
0 0 10 10
1 0 2 2

```
