title: Uva 11626  Convex Hull

## Input

```text
Finding the convex hull of a set of points is an important
problem that is often part of a larger problem. There are
many algorithms for finding the convex hull. Since prob-
lems involving the convex hull sometimes appear in the
ACM World Finals, it is a good idea for contestants to
know some of these algorithms.

Finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane
can be divided into two sub-tasks. First, given a set of
points, find a subset of those points that, when joined with
line segments, form a convex polygon that encloses all of the
original points. Second, output the points of the convex hull
in order, walking counter-clockwise around the polygon. In
this problem, the first sub-task has already been done for
you, and your program should complete the second sub-task. That is, given the points that are known
to lie on the convex hull, output them in order walking counter-clockwise around the hull.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains a single integer, the number of test cases to follow. The first line of
each test case contains a single integer 3  n  100000, the number of points. The following n lines of
the test case each describe a point. Each of these lines contains two integers and either a Y or an N,
separated by spaces. The two integers specify the x- and y-coordinates of the point. A Y indicates
that the point is on the convex hull of all the points, and a N indicates that it is not. The x- and
y-coordinates of each point will be no less than -1000000000 and no greater than 1000000000. No point
will appear more than once in the same test case. The points in a test case will never all lie on a line.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, generate the following output. First, output a line containing a single integer m, the
number of points on the convex hull. Next output m lines, each describing a point on the convex hull,
in counter-clockwise order around the hull. Each of these lines should contain the x-coordinate of the
point, followed by a space, followed by the y-coordinate of the point. Start with the point on the hull
whose x-coordinate is minimal. If there are multiple such points, start with the one whose y-coordinate
is minimal.
