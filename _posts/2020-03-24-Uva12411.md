title: Uva 12411  A Dangerous Maze II
---


## Input

```
You are in a maze; seeing n doors in front of you in beginning. You can choose any door you like. The
probability for choosing a door is equal for all doors.

If you choose the i-th door, it can either take you back to the same position where you begun in
xi minutes, or can take you out of the maze after xi minutes. If you come back to the same position,
you can remember last K doors you have chosen. And when you are about to choose a door, you never
choose a door that is already visited by you. Or we can say that you never choose a door that is visited
as one of the last K doors. And the probability of choosing any remaining door is equal.

Now you want to find the expected time to get out of the maze.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case contains a blank line and two integers n K (1  n  100, 0  K  n). The next line
contains n space separated integers. If the i-th integer (xi) is positive, you can assume that the i-th
door will take you out of maze after xi minutes. If its negative, then the i-th door will take you back
to the beginning position after abs(xi) minutes. You can safely assume that 1  abs(xi)  10000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and the expected time to get out of the maze. If its impossible
to get out of the maze, print -1.000. Otherwise print the result rounded to three places after the
decimal point. Add 109 to your result to avoid precision errors.
