title: Uva 11382  Fear of The Dark

## Input

```text
At night or strolling through the park, fear of the dark.

When Dickenson was walking in a dark road, he noticed that he has been surrounded by N ghosts. So
he stopped at the point (x, y) and realized that each ghost is shaped like a line segment. The ghosts
are fixed at their positions and they are not moving. Dickenson was lucky that he was carrying a gun
which can shoot anti-ghost ray to kill ghosts. But the gun can shoot the ray at a particular angle
 and can shoot at most K shots. The angle  cant be less than 1 degree or greater than 180 degree.
Whenever he shoots a ray, the ray spreads at the angle  and goes towards infinity and destroying any
body parts of the ghosts in its path. A ghost is said to be killed if anti-ghost rays destroy its whole
body. If there is just a single point on the ghosts body that is not being destroyed, the ghost is alive.
He can shoot to any direction. Note that sometimes he may need several shots at several directions to
completely kill a ghost. Given Dickensons position (x, y), the maximum shots K and the endpoints of
the body of all the ghosts you have to determine the minimum angle which can be used to kill all the
ghosts.

The above picture shows how the gun works. A shot has been made at the angle  and the ray
destroyed some parts of the ghost G1 and then it destroyed the whole body of the ghost G2.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains X, the number of test cases. Each case starts with four numbers N
(1  N  50), K (1  K  10), x and y. Where N is the number of ghosts, K is the maximum number
of shots that can be made using the gun, (x, y) is the Cartesian co-ordinate of Dickensons position.
Then there will be N lines containing four numbers x1, y1, x2 and y2 describing each ghosts body.
Here (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the end points of a ghosts body. All the co-ordinates in the input file
have an absolute magnitude at most 10,000. For no ghost (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x, y) will be collinear.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For every test case you have to output one line which contains the minimum angle  to shoot all the
ghosts. You have to output  to 4 decimal places. Errors less than or equal to 0.0001 are considered
to be correct. If it is impossible to kill all the ghosts then output -1.0000.
