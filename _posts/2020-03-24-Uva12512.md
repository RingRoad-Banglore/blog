title: Uva 12512  CrossShaped Tests
---


## Input

```
There is an n  n matrix. Each number can be increased or decreased. If we increase a number by x
(which may be non-integer), the cost is c  x. If we decrease a number by x, the cost is d  x, where c
and d are two non-negative integers.

The theoretical goal is to make every number equal to F , but in practice we only do Q tests, each
test is to specify a square, then adding all the numbers in the same row or column, if the difference
between the sum and (2n 1)F is at most e, the test is successful.

Your task is to survive all the tests with minimal cost. Its not hard to see that the actual new
matrix might be very different from the theoretical goal.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains T (T  100), the number of test cases. Each of the following lines begins with
six integers n, c, d, F , e, Q (1  n  12, 0  c, d  100, 10  F  10, 0  e  5, 1  Q  n2).
Then an n  n matrix of integers followed. Each integer will have an absolute value of no greater than
10. Then Q lines followed. Each line contains two integers x, y (1  x, y  n), that means we make
a test on the square at row x, column y. Rows are numbered 1 to n from top to bottom, columns are
numbered 1 to n from left to right. Each test case is terminated by a blank line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the minimal cost, to five digits after the decimal point.
