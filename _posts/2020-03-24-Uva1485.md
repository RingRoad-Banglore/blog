title: Uva 01485  Permutation Counting
---


## Input

```
Given a permutation a1, a2, . . . aN of {1, 2, . . . , N}, we define its E-value as the amount of elements
where ai > i. For example, the E-value of permutation {1, 3, 2, 4} is 1, while the E-value of {4, 3, 2, 1}
is 2. You are requested to find how many permutations of {1, 2, . . . , N} whose E-value is exactly k.
```

## Output

```
There are several test cases, and one line for each case, which contains two integers, N and k. (1 
N  1000, 0  k  N).

```

## Sample Input

```
Output one line for each case. For the answer may be quite huge, you need to output the answer module
1,000,000,007.

Explanation for the sample:
There is only one permutation with E-value 0: {1, 2, 3}, and there are four permutations with

E-value 1: {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}

```

## Sample Output

```
3 0
3 1

```
