title: Uva 12598  Starting School
---


```
The first day of school is a very memorable day to everyone. Po is starting school from today and Po is
very excited. As this is Pos first day at school, no one is assigned roll number yet. So all the students
form a line in the school field and they are being assigned roll number one by one. The teacher is a
bit crazy. Instead of assigning roll number from 1, she starts assigning them one by one in a random
fashion. Po watches this madness for the first K students and then steps up. Po says Po can assign
them very easily for the rest of the students. The idea is very simple. Roll number should be unique
and a student should get the smallest roll number that has not been assigned yet to any of the students.
For example if K = 4, total number of students are 10 and the first K students roll numbers are 1, 3,
5, 10 then the next 6 roll numbers should be 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

Though this is a very good idea, the teacher got mad at Po. So she starts asking the roll number
for various students. As there are many students, Po is feeling helpless. Can you help Po?

## Input

```
First line will contain an integer T (T  30), the number of test cases. Each case will start with three
integers N (0 < N  109), K (0 < K  50, 000 and K  N) and Q (0 < Q  50, 000). N is the
total number of students, K is described earlier and Q is the number of queries of the crazy teacher.
Next line will contain K distinct integers, the first K roll number assigned by the teacher. These values
will be between 1 and 1000000000 (inclusive). Next will be Q integers, each indicating a position of
students. These values will be between 1 and N (inclusive).

```

## Output

```
For each case print one line Case T: where T is the case number. Then for each query print one line
with the roll number of the student standing on the queried position. See sample I/O for clarity.
