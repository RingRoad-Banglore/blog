## Input

```

Figure 5: A graph G and the weights of the
edges

Given an undirected weighted graph G, you should
find one of spanning trees specified as follows.

The graph G is an ordered pair (V,E), where V
is a set of vertices {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and E is a set of
undirected edges {e1, e2, . . . , em}. Each edge e  E
has its weight w(e).

A spanning tree T is a tree (a connected subgraph
without cycles) which connects all the n vertices with
n  1 edges. The slimness of a spanning tree T is
defined as the difference between the largest weight
and the smallest weight among the n 1 edges of T .

For example, a graph G in Figure 5(a) has four
vertices {v1, v2, v3, v4} and five undirected edges {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5}. The weights of the edges are w(e1) =
3, w(e2) = 5, w(e3) = 6, w(e4) = 6, w(e5) = 7 as shown in Figure 5(b).

Figure 6: Examples of the spanning trees of G

There are several spanning trees for G. Four of them are depicted in Figure 6(a)(d). The spanning
tree Ta in Figure 6(a) has three edges whose weights are 3, 6 and 7. The largest weight is 7 and the
smallest weight is 3 so that the slimness of the tree Ta is 4. The slimnesses of spanning trees Tb, Tc and
Td shown in Figure 6(b), (c) and (d) are 3, 2 and 1, respectively. You can easily see the slimness of any
other spanning tree is greater than or equal to 1, thus the spanning tree Td in Figure 6(d) is one of the
slimmest spanning trees whose slimness is 1.

Your job is to write a program that computes the smallest slimness.

## Output

```
The input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line containing two zeros separated by a space.
Each dataset has the following format.

n m
a1 b1 w1
...
am bm wm

Every input item in a dataset is a non-negative integer. Items in a line are separated by a space.

n is the number of the vertices and m the number of the edges. You can assume 2  n  100 and
0  m  n(n  1)/2. ak and bk (k = 1, . . . ,m) are positive integers less than or equal to n, which

represent the two vertices vak and vbk connected by the k-th edge ek. wk is a positive integer less than
or equal to 10000, which indicates the weight of ek. You can assume that the graph G = (V,E) is
simple, that is, there are no self-loops (that connect the same vertex) nor parallel edges (that are two
or more edges whose both ends are the same two vertices).

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset, if the graph has spanning trees, the smallest slimness among them should be printed.
Otherwise, -1 should be printed. An output should not contain extra characters.
