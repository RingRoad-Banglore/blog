title: Uva 13114  Josephus lottery II
---


```
The professor Humbertov Moralov wants to make a raffle between the 100 students of his Data Structure
class and Pepito (Student of this group) suggests to use the Josephus problem to determine who is the
winner of the raffle, but the thing is that you can know beforehand the winning position if you know
the value of n (the total of students in the raffle) and the value k (amount of movements to throwing
out students from the circle).

The price is kind of interesting, the winner wont have to present the final exam, and for that reason
the professor Humbertov proposes the following variant to josephus problem: Take the student class
list, in which the students are numbered from 1 to 100, then, organize this numbers in a circle and
begin to count from number 1 until getting the value k (Take into account that you count clockwise),
the student with number k in the list is removed from the circle, and now you begin to count from the
number of the next student (k + 1), but in counterclockwise, the student with the number in which
the count stopped is removed from the circle, and then you repeat the process alternating between
counterclockwise and clockwise counting until you get the winner of the raffle.

The professor Humbertov wants to be sure that student that will win the raffle will be Pepito,
because Pepito is the best student in his course, and for that reason he must ensure that pepitos
position will be the winning position, so in order to accomplish this you have to calculate the minimum
value k that generates that position and help the Professor Humbertov, after this favor he for sure will
increase your grades in his class of formal languages and grammars.
