## Input

```text
We all probably know how to find equation of bisectors in Coordinate Geometry. If the equations of
two lines are aix+ biy + ci = 0 and ajx+ bjy + cj = 0, then the equations of the bisectors of the four
angles they create are given by

aix+ biy + ci
a2i + b

2
i

= 
ajx+ bjy + cj

a2j + b
2
j

Now one has to be quite intelligent to find out for which angles to choose the + (plus) sign and
for which angles to choose the - (minus) sign. You will have to do similar sort of choosing in this
problem. Suppose there is a fixed point (Cx, Cy) and there are n (n  10000) other points around
it. No two points from these n points are collinear with (Cx, Cy). If you connect all these point with
(Cx, Cy) you will get a star-topology like image made of n lines. The equations of these n lines are also
given and only these equations must be used when finding the equation of bisectors. This n lines create
n(n 1)/2 acute or obtuse angles in total and so they have total n(n 1)/2 bisectors. You have to find
out how many of these bisectors have equations formed using the + sign. The image below shows an
image where n = 5, Cx = 5 and Cy = 2. This image corresponds to the only sample input.

Figure: Five lines above create 5(5 1)/2 = 10 angles and these angles has 10 bisectors. Of these 10
bisectors, the equation of only 4 are formed using the + sign of the formula

aix+ biy + ci
a2i + b

2
i

= 
ajx+ bjy + cj

a2j + b
2
j
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains maximum 35 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 11819  Bisectors 2/2

First line of each set contains three integers Cx, Cy (10000  Cx, Cy  10000) and n (0  n 
10000). Each of the next n lines contains two integers xi, yi (20000  xi, yi  20000) and a string of
the form aix + biy + ci = 0. Here (xi, yi) is the coordinate of a point around (Cx, Cy) and the string
denotes the equation of the line segment formed by connecting (Cx, Cy) and (xi, yi). You can assume
that (100000  ai, bi  100000) and (2000000000  ci  2000000000). This equation will actually
be used to find the equations of bisectors of the angles that this line creates.

Input is terminated by a set where the value of n is zero.
