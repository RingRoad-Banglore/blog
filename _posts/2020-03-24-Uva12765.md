title: Uva 12765  Factorial Products
---


## Input

```

For the purpose of this problem, we will define a factorial product to
be a multiplication of several factorials of single digit numbers.

For example, the expression 5! * 3! * 4! * 3! is a product of four
factorials, where each factorial is generated by a single digit. Given two
factorial products, are they equal?
```

## Output

```
The input will contain multiple test cases (at most 450). Each case starts with two integers N and M
on a line (1  N,M  1, 000), the number of factors in each factorial product. The next line contains
N digits, each digit being between 0 and 9 inclusive, specifying the generators of the N factorial factors
in the first product. The third line contains M digits, also between 0 and 9, specifying the generators
of the M factorial factors in the second product.

For instance 5! * 3! * 4! * 3! would be given as 5 3 4 3.
Input will end with a line containing two zeroes.

## Sample Input

```
For each expression print on a separate line either YES or NO, the answer to the question Are the
two factorial products equal?
