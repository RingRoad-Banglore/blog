11298 Dissecting a Hexagon
Given an integer n, determine whether it is possible to dissect a regular hexagon into n parallelograms
of equal area. An example of a hexagon dissected into 3 parallelograms is given below.

## Input
There is at most 800 inputs. Each input is n (n < 1000001)

## Output
For each input, output the answer on a single line. Output ‘1’ if it is possible to dissect a regular
hexagon into n parallelograms, otherwise output ‘0’.

## Sample Input
<p>2</p><p>147</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>0</p><p>1</p>
