title: Uva 12922  Crossing the river
---


## Input

```
After a zombie apocalypse, a group of n survivors were left to die
on NP-Land. For days, they fought against hunger, thirst and
obviously, zombies. Pursued by the evil creatures, they traveled
all over the city and finally arrived at the port. Luckily, they
found a small boat, but theres a problem! The boat has only k
seats, and if that wasnt enough, they will sink if the weight on
board is over the limit W .

Because of that, the survivors decided to make as many trips
as needed to escape from NP-Land. A trip is considered as going
from the citys port to a safe island (or viceversa). There must
be at least one person on each trip (in order to drive the boat).

You, as the only coder to survive the apocalypse, must help your friends to create an algorithm that
minimizes the number of trips. Do it fast! The zombies are knocking on the door!
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains 3 integers, n (1  n  16),
W (1  W  100) and k (1  k  6). The next line will contain n integers specifying wi the weight of
every survivor (1  wi  100).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print an integer with an end of line, representing the minimum number of travels or
-1 if its impossible.

```

## Sample Output

```
2 100 2
50 50
3 50 2
10 40 40

```
