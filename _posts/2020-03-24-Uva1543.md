## Input

```

Dr. Extreme experimentally made an extremely precise telescope to investigate extremely curi- ous
phenomena at an extremely distant place. In order to make the telescope so precise as to investigate
phenomena at such an extremely distant place, even quite a small distortion is not allowed. However,
he forgot the influence of the internal gas affected by low-frequency vibration of magnetic flux passing
through the telescope. The cylinder of the telescope is not affected by the low-frequency vibration, but
the internal gas is.

The cross section of the telescope forms a perfect circle. If he forms a coil by putting extremely thin
wire along the (inner) circumference, he can measure (the average vertical component of) the temporal
variation of magnetic flux:such measurement would be useful to estimate the influence. But points on
the circumference at which the wire can be fixed are limited; furthermore, the number of special clips
to fix the wire is also limited. To obtain the highest sensitivity, he wishes to form a coil of a polygon
shape with the largest area by stringing the wire among carefully selected points on the circumference.

Your job is to write a program which reports the maximum area of all possible m-polygons (polygons
with exactly m vertices) each of whose vertices is one of the n points given on a circumference with a
radius of 1. An example of the case n = 4 and m = 3 is illustrated below.

In the figure above, the equations such as p1 = 0.0 indicate the locations of the n given points,
and the decimals such as 1.000000 on m-polygons indicate the areas of m-polygons.

Parameter pi denotes the location of the i-th given point on the circumference (1  i  n). The
location p of a point on the circumference is in the range 0  p < 1, corresponding to the range of
rotation angles from 0 to 2 radians. That is, the rotation angle of a point at p to the point at 0 equals
2p radians. ( is the circular constant 3.14159265358979323846....)

You may rely on the fact that the area of an isosceles triangle ABC (AB = AC = 1) with an interior
angle BAC of  radians (0 <  < ) is 1

2
sin, and the area of a polygon inside a circle with a radius

of 1 is less than .

## Output

```
The input consists of multiple subproblems followed by a line containing two zeros that indicates the
end of the input. Each subproblem is given in the following format.

n m
p1 p2    pn

n is the number of points on the circumference (3  n  40). m is the number of vertices to form
m-polygons (3  m  n). The locations of n points, p1, p2, . . . , pn, are given as decimals and they are
separated by either a space character or a newline. In addition, you may assume that 0  p1 < p2 <
   < pn < 1.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each subproblem, the maximum area should be output, each in a separate line. Each value in the
output may not have an error greater than 0.000001 and its fractional part should be represented by 6
decimal digits after the decimal point.
