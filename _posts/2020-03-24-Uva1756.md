## Input

```

You have decided to spend a day of your trip to Rapid City taking photographs of the South Dakota
Badlands, which are renowned for their spectacular and unusual land formations. You are an amateur
photographer, yet very particular about lighting conditions.

After some careful research, you have located a beautiful location in the Badlands, surrounded by
picturesque landscapes. You have determined a variety of features that you wish to photograph from
this location. For each feature you have identified the earliest and latest time of day at which the
position of the sun is ideal. However, it will take quite a bit of time to take each photograph, given the
need to reposition the tripod and camera and your general perfectionism. So you are wondering if it
will be possible to successfully take photographs of all these features in one day.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of the input contains two integers n (1  n  104) and t (1  t  105), where n is the
number of desired photographs and t is the time you spend to take each photograph. Following that are
n additional lines, each describing the available time period for one of the photographs. Each such line
contains two nonnegative integers a and b, where a is the earliest time that you may begin working on
that photograph, and b is the time by which the photograph must be completed, with a+ t  b  109 .

```
