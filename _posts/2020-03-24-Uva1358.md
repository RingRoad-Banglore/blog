## Input

```

We can generate a random string by generating a sequence of random characters and concatenating
them together. Each character is chosen independently from the first n letters in the English alphabet
with equal probability. Only capital letters are used in this problem. The generation is stopped as soon
as a specific pattern occurs in the random string.

Your task is to predict the expected length of the generated string.
```

## Output

```
Standard input will contain multiple test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T (1 
T  10) which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow, each preceded by a single blank line.

Each test case consists of a single integer N (1  N  26) which is the number of letters used, and
a pattern, which is a non-empty string consisting of letters chosen from the first N upper case English
letters. The length of any pattern will not exceed 12.

```

## Sample Input

```
Results should be directed to standard output. Start each case with Case #: on a single line, where
# is the case number starting from 1. Two consecutive cases should be separated by a single blank
line. No blank line should be produced after the last test case.

For each test case, print the expected length of the generated random string.
