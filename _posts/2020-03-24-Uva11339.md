## Input

```
According to Wikipedia

The term sonnet derives from the Provencal word sonet and the Italian word sonetto, both
meaning little song. By the thirteenth century, it had come to signify a poem of fourteen
lines that follows a strict rhyme scheme and logical structure. The conventions associated
with the sonnet have evolved over its history. The writers of sonnets are known as sonneteers.

Written in Spanish, sonnets have a well defined structure over the rhymes. Moreover, these days
sonneteers are scarce as good weather and the rules governing the rhymes are rather permissive. Let
us consider the following poem:

ES ELLA
Locura, intensa y sin medida
andando errante te avist,
una nota en tus manos encontr:
rumor de un amor y su partida.
Adelante, te dir de su vida
aunque en mi regazo ya no est,
fueron sus labios con que tropec
los que te llamaron despavorida.
Ojos negros, pestaas en un ramo,
rizos finos, humor, siempre bella;
!`es ella, amiga, a quien amo!
Zagales de secretos sus estrellas,
cmplices la lluvia y el lamo;
... es ella, nuestra musa, !`es ella!

This poem must be consider as sonnet because it meets the following rules:

1. It has 14 lines.

2. Its rhymes have the structure ABBAABBACDCDCD, where A, B, C and D correspond to the
suffixes ida, , amo, and ella of the given line. In general, we are to allow any rhyme structure
as long as it follows one of the patterns ABBAABBACDECDE, ABBAABBACDEDCE or
ABBAABBACDCDCD.

3. It has hendecasyllable meter.

Today you are to help the local Spanish School of Sonneteers (SSS) writing a program that verifies
if a given composition sticks to the first two rules of a Spanish sonnet. The last rule is to be checked
by the SSSs master sonneteer once the given poem passes the tests exercised by the verifier you are
about to code.

For the purpose of your work, two lines rhyme if, after cleaning them, they have the same suffix.
Given a line in the sonnet, its clean version is the result of deleting blanks, punctuation symbols (, !,
,, ., :, ;, , ?, -) and the last s (if there is one) from the end of the original line.

## Output

```
The input consists of several instances of the problem, each one occurring separated by a new line.
Each instance consists of n > 2 lines: the first one consists of a list of s suffixes (4  s  5), separated
by a blank character. The suffixes are to be called A, B, C, D and E according to the order in which
they occur and the total number of them. The second line contains the title of the composition. The
following n  2 lines contain the actual lines of the composition. Each line in the sonnet has at most
80 characters. You can safely assume that, in a case, a given suffix is not suffix of another one.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each problem instance, and according to the order of the input, your program should print a sentence
of the form

< NAME >: < STRUCTURE >

if the given composition adheres to the first two rules of a spanish sonnet or

< NAME >: Not a chance!

in other case, where < NAME > is to be replaced by the name of the composition and <
STRUCTURE > corresponds to the structure of the rhyme, and is given by the order in which
the suffixes occur.

Esta composicin posiblemente rima
pero nunca ser un soneto
con esta frase ya no sirve
ni tampoco porque est incompleto.
