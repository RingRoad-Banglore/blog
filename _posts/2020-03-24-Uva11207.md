title: Uva 11207  The Easiest Way
---


## Input

```
As a participant in the Programming
Olympiads in Murcia, your purpose is to
win as many paper birds as possible. But this
year the problems are so difficult. . . So you
decide to take the easiest way: to make the
paper birds yourself.

You want to make 4 paper birds of the same
size, pretending that you have solved 4 problems thus classifying for SWERC2007. N rectangular
pieces of paper of different sizes are available. Each piece of paper, i, has width wi and height hi. Your
task is to select one piece in order to maximize the size of the 4 birds. You have to take into account
that, to make a bird, a square piece of paper is needed. The paper can be cut off, but not glued.

If more than one optimum piece of paper is possible, you have to indicate the first one.
```

## Output

```
The input may contain several test cases. For each test case, the first line indicates the number of
pieces of paper, N . The following N lines contain the sizes of the pieces of paper; each line contains
two integers: wi and hi. The input ends with a case where N = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case (except for the case with N = 0), the output should consist of an integer indicating
the number of the piece to make the biggest paper birds. The first piece is 1, the second is 2, and so
on. If many solutions are possible, output the first one.
