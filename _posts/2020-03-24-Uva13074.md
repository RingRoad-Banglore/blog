title: Uva 13074  Fixed-point theorem
---


## Input

```text
In the family of mathematical theorems called fixed-point, Brouwer studied one
that, apparently, he explained with the analogy of stirring to dissolve sugar in a
cup of coffee. Brouwer stated that at any moment, there is a point/molecule in the
cup that didnt change its place.

We wont study that theorem, but we are left with the idea that, when stirring
a cup of coffee, molecules exchange their places to end up in a completely different
spot of the cup.

Lets take a small example (in which the fixed-point theorem is not even ful-
filled): molecule 1 could have occupied the spot that molecule 2 had before,
molecule 2 gone to where molecule 3 was and, finally, molecule 3 moved to the
original place of 1.

If we were capable of replicating the same movement over and over again, a
time would come in which the cup of coffee would go back to its original state:

The question we ask ourselves is, given the description of the exchange of molecules we achieve with
the motion in the cup of coffee, how many times do we have to repeat the movement so that the state
of the cup goes back to being the same as the original?
```

## Output

```text
The input will consist of several test cases. Each of them consists of two lines, the first one containing
the number of molecules in the cup of coffee (1  n  100) and the other one indicating the movement
of molecules that will happen every time that the cup is stirred.

The movement is defined by n integers indicating, for each position of one molecule, in which position
it will end up the molecule that was occupying that place.

The input finishes with an empty cup, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, write the number of times that the cup of coffee should be stirred so that each
molecule goes back to the original place. It is ensured that this number wont exceed 109.
