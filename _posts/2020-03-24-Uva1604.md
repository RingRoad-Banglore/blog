## Input

```text

Lets play a puzzle using eight cubes placed on a 3 3 board leaving one empty square.
Faces of cubes are painted with three colors. As a puzzle step, you can roll one of the cubes to the

adjacent empty square. Your goal is to make the specified color pattern visible from above by a number
of such steps. The rules of this puzzle are as follows.

1. Coloring of Cubes: All the cubes are colored in the same way as shown in Figure 3. The
opposite faces have the same color.

2. Initial Board State: Eight cubes are placed on the 3 3 board leaving one empty square. All
the cubes have the same orientation as shown in Figure 4. As shown in the figure, squares on the
board are given x and y coordinates, (1, 1), (1, 2), . . . , and (3, 3). The position of the initially
empty square may vary.

3. Rolling Cubes: At each step, we can choose one of the cubes adjacent to the empty square and
roll it into the empty square, leaving the original position empty. Figure 5 shows an example.

4. Goal: The goal of this puzzle is to arrange the cubes so that their top faces form the specified
color pattern by a number of cube rolling steps described above.

Your task is to write a program that finds the minimum number of steps required to make the
specified color pattern from the given initial state.

## Output

```text
The input is a sequence of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros
separated by a space. The number of datasets is less than 16. Each dataset is formatted as follows.

x y
F11 F21 F31
F12 F22 F32
F13 F23 F33

The first line contains two integers x and y separated by a space, indicating the position (x, y) of
the initially empty square. The values of x and y are 1, 2, or 3.

The following three lines specify the color pattern to make. Each line contains three characters
F1j , F2j , and F3j , separated by a space. Character Fij indicates the top color of the cube, if any, at
position (i, j) as follows:

B: Blue,

W: White,

R: Red,

E: the square is Empty.

There is exactly one E character in each dataset.

## Sample Input

```text
For each dataset, output the minimum number of steps to achieve the goal, when the goal can be
reached within 30 steps. Otherwise, output -1 for the dataset.
