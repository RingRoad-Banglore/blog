## Input

```text
Yi Sima was one of the best counselors of Cao Cao. He likes to play a funny game himself. It looks like
the modern Sudoku, but smaller.

Actually, Yi Sima was playing it different. First of all, he tried to generate a 4 4 board with every
row contains 1 to 4, every column contains 1 to 4. Also he made sure that if we cut the board into four
2 2 pieces, every piece contains 1 to 4.

Then, he removed several numbers from the board and gave it to another guy to recover it. As
other counselors are not as smart as Yi Sima, Yi Sima always made sure that the board only has one
way to recover.

Actually, you are seeing this because youve passed through to the Three-Kingdom Age. You can
recover the board to make Yi Sima happy and be promoted. Go and do it!!!
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T (1  T  100). T test cases follow. Each
test case starts with an empty line followed by 4 lines. Each line consist of 4 characters. Each character
represents the number in the corresponding cell (one of 1, 2, 3, 4). * represents that number was
removed by Yi Sima.

Its guaranteed that there will be exactly one way to recover the board.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x:, where x is the test case number (starting
from 1). Then output 4 lines with 4 characters each. indicate the recovered board.
