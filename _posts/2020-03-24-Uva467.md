title: Uva 00467  Synching Signals

## Input

```
On your way to work wach morning you travel down a main traffic artery regulated by a number of
traffic signals. On some mornings, you have noticed that all of the lights up ahead simultaneously turn
green in your direction. But on other mornings, it seems that a random combination of red, yellow,
and green is facing you.

After recently observing all of the lights ahead of you turn green simultaneously, you began to
wonder how long after any one of them turns to yellow it would take before they all would be displaying
green in your direction again. Write a program to figure out how long it will take such a set of traffic
signals to all be displaying green again, given the cycle times for each traffic signal in the set.
```

## Output

```
The input file will consist of an unknown number of traffic signal datasets. Each signal dataset will
consist of one line of integers (separated by spaces) giving the total cycle time (in seconds) for each
signal. The cycle time is the total time that a signal will stay green and yellow in one direction and red
in the opposite direction. In this problem, you may assume that a green signal will turn yellow for the
last 5 seconds of its cycle. If one set of signals was given as:

30 25 35

your program would need to recognize that there are three signals in the set, that the first signal lasts
30 seconds, that the second signal cycles every 25 seconds, and that the thirs signal takes 35 seconds
to start a new cycle. Specifically, the first signal will be red for 30 seconds in one direction, then green
for 25 seconds, then yellow for 5.

Each set of signals will involve at least two and as many as 10 signals. Each signal will have a
minimum cycle time of 10 seconds and a maximum cycle time of 90 seconds.

```

## Sample Input

```
Your output will consist of a summary line for each set of signals. Your program should assign an ID
number to each set of signals, beginning with set 1. The output line will begin with the signal set ID
number and state the number of minutes ( 60) and seconds (< 60) it will take from when all of the
signals simultaneously turn green initially to the first time they will all be showing green again in your
direction after any of them has turned yellow. Note that this time may or may not be a time when all
of the signals in the set simultaneously change back to green  for this problem you need only indicate
how long it will be before all signals in the set are once again simultaneously showing green in your
direction after any of them has turned to yellow, even if this condition will only exist for a second or a
very few seconds.

If the signals will never simultaneously display green in your direction again within an hour, you
should print a message that states that the signals in the set are not able to synchronize after one
hour (note that an output of 60 minutes and 0 seconds should, however, be considered a successful
synchronization).

Look at the sample output below for the exact format.
