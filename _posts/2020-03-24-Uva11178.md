title: Uva 11178  Morleys Theorem
---


## Input

```
Morleys theorem states that that the lines tri-
secting the angles of an arbitrary plane triangle
meet at the vertices of an equilateral triangle.
For example in the figure below the tri-sectors
of angles A, B and C has intersected and cre-
ated an equilateral triangle DEF.

Of course the theorem has various gener-
alizations, in particular if all of the tri-sectors
are intersected one obtains four other equilat-
eral triangles. But in the original theorem only
tri-sectors nearest to BC are allowed to inter-
sect to get point D, tri-sectors nearest to CA
are allowed to intersect point E and tri-sectors
nearest to AB are intersected to get point F. Trisector like BD and CE are not allowed to intersect. So
ultimately we get only one equilateral triangle DEF. Now your task is to find the Cartesian coordinates
of D, E and F given the coordinates of A, B, and C.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 5001) which denotes the number of
test cases to follow. Each of the next lines contain six integers XA, YA, XB, YB, XC , YC . This six
integers actually indicates that the Cartesian coordinates of point A, B and C are (XA, YA),(XB, YB)
and (XC , YC) respectively. You can assume that the area of triangle ABC is not equal to zero, 0 
XA, YA, XB, YB, XC , YC  1000 and the points A, B and C are in counter clockwise order.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input you should produce one line of output. This line contains six floating point
numbers XD, YD, XE , YE , XF , YF separated by a single space. These six floating-point actually means
that the Cartesian coordinates of D, E and F are (XD, YD),(XE , YE) ,(XF , YF ) respectively. Errors less
than 105 will be accepted.
