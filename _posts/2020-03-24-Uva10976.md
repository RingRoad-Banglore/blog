---


## Input

```
It is easy to see that for every fraction in the form 1

k
(k > 0), we can always find two positive integers

x and y, x  y, such that:

1

k
=

1

x
+

1

y

Now our question is: can you write a program that counts how many such pairs of x and y there
are for any given k?
```

## Output

```
Input contains no more than 100 lines, each giving a value of k (0 < k  10000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each k, output the number of corresponding (x, y) pairs, followed by a sorted list of the values of x
and y, as shown in the sample output.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
12
