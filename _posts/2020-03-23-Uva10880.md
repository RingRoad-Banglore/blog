Colin and Ryan had a party. They baked C cookies and invited G guests. Each guest ate Q cookies,
and R cookies were left (R < Q).

## Input
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one is a line containing
C and R (at most 2000000000).

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing ‘Case #x:’ followed by Q — the number of cookies each
guest ate. If there are multiple answers, print them in increasing order, separated by spaces. Do not
print trailing spaces. Print a ‘0’ in the case when R = C.
