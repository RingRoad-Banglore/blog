12377 Number Coding
In a special coding proposed by ACM group of Shiraz University, each integer number can be represented
by the number of its prime factors followed by the frequency numbers of factors arranged in an increasing
order. For example, 32 = 25 has only 1 prime factor and its frequency is 5. So, it can be represented
by 15. Also, 43560 = 23 × 32 × 51 × 112 has 4 factors with frequencies 3, 2, 1 and 2, hence coded as
41223. As another example, 7168 is coded into 2110. Considering only 9 prime factors {2, 3, 5, 7, 11,
13, 17, 19, 23} and given a coded number C, you should identify how many numbers share the coded
representation C.

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T as the number of test-cases. Each following line gives
a code word C which will not exceed 20 characters.

## Output
Print for each test-case, in a separate line, the number of possible integers that have identical translation
C.

## Sample Input
<p>4</p><p>123</p><p>213</p><p>31312</p><p>311111</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>9</p><p>72</p><p>504</p><p>504</p>
