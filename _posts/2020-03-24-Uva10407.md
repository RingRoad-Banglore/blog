```
Integer division between a dividend n and a divisor d yields a quotient
q and a remainder r. q is the integer which maximizes q  d such that
q  d  n and r = n q  d.

For any set of integers there is an integer d such that each of the
given integers when divided by d leaves the same remainder.
```

## Input

```
Each line of input contains a sequence of nonzero integer numbers sep-
arated by a space. The last number on each line is 0 and this number
does not belong to the sequence. There will be at least 2 and no more
than 1000 numbers in a sequence; not all numbers occuring in a se-
quence are equal. The last line of input contains a single 0 and this line
should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input, output the largest integer which when divided into each of the input integers
leaves the same remainder.
