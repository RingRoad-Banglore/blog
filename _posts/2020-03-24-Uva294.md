title: Uva 00294  Divisors
---


## Input

```text
Mathematicians love all sorts of odd properties of numbers. For instance, they consider 945 to be an
interesting number, since it is the first odd number for which the sum of its divisors is larger than the
number itself.

To help them search for interesting numbers, you are to write a program that scans a range of
numbers and determines the number that has the largest number of divisors in the range. Unfortunately,
the size of the numbers, and the size of the range is such that a too simple-minded approach may take
too much time to run. So make sure that your algorithm is clever enough to cope with the largest
possible range in just a few seconds.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input specifies the number N of ranges, and each of the N following lines contains a
range, consisting of a lower bound L and an upper bound U , where L and U are included in the range.
L and U are chosen such that 1  L  U  1000000000 and 0  U  L  10000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each range, find the number P which has the largest number of divisors (if several numbers tie for
first place, select the lowest), and the number of positive divisors D of P (where P is included as a
divisor). Print the text Between L and H, P has a maximum of D divisors., where L, H, P ,
and D are the numbers as defined above.

```

## Sample Output

1000 1000
