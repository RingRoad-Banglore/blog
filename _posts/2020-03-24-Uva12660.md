title: Uva 12660  Ears Cutting
---


```

A famous way to cut polygon into triangles is ear cutting: each time cut off a triangle along a diagonal,
after n 3 cuts only a single triangle remains. In the following picture, the ear {2,3,4} was cut off.

Find a way to cut ears of a simple polygon such that the sum of cut lengths is minimal.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 30 test cases. The first line of each case contains the number of vertices, n
(4  n  100). Each of the following n lines contains the coordinates of a vertex, in clockwise or
counter-clockwise order. Coordinates are integers whose absolute value does not exceed 10000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the minimal sum of cut lengths, rounded to 4 decimal digits.
