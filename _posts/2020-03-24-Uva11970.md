title: Uva 11970  Lucky Numbers
---


## Input

```text
Every person has its own numbers that he considers lucky. Usually the numbers are fixed like 3 or 7
and do not depend on anything. This lucky number model seems to be very primitive for John, so he
decided to upgrade it for his own use. Maybe more complex model will bring more luck to him?

John has added a dependency for lucky numbers on specific integer N (for example N can be ordinal
number of day in year or some other meaning). For each N John considers some number X lucky if
and only if fraction X/


N X value is integer and greater than zero.
```

## Output

```text
The number of tests T (T  100) is given on the first line. T lines follow, each of them contains one
integer N (1  N  109) described above.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a single line Case T: S. Where T is the test case number (starting from
1) and S is increasing sequence of numbers considered lucky by John for specified N . Please refer to
the sample output for clarity.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
16
109
33
