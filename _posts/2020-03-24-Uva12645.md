title: Uva 12645  Water Supply
---


## Input

```

Technopark is a huge industrial park surrounded by small residential towns, inhabited by its workers.
Technopark owns a dam, which provides electricity and clean drinking water to its facilities and some
residential towns. The remaining towns get their water from dug wells.

Recently, some workers and their families have gotten a disease caused by bacteria found in some
wells, so it has been decided to extend the water supply network to take dam water from Technopark to
every residential town. Some pipelines connecting pairs of towns already exist but additional pipelines
could possibly be needed. Pipelines are unidirectional, i.e., they only allow water transportation in one
direction, and every pipeline connects exactly two towns.

Your task is to compute the minimum number of pipelines that must be installed to take dam water
to every residential town.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case has two blank-separated integers
N and M , where N is the number of residential towns (1  N  1000) and M is the number of existing
pipelines (0  M  100000). Towns are numbered from 0 to N , being Technopark town 0. Each of the
next M lines contains two blank-separated integers a and b (0  a  N , 0  b  N) indicating that
there is a pipeline taking water from town a to town b.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the minimum number of pipelines that must be built to take dam water to
every residential town.
