## Input

```
Since the times of the Mighty Roman Empire, it has been customary to have signals by the roads
informing the distance to the greatest city on Earth (that is Rome), the location of a landmark along
the road, and in more recent times, the maximum allowed speed. Making all these road signs can
be a problem even for someone as mighty as the famous Emperor Tiberius: when he committed the
construction of the Via Solis, he personally supervised the design of every road sign. Little did he know
that he was making an infantile mistake because of a basic misunderstanding of how Roman numerals
work.

The Roman number system is based on seven basic capital letters, where I=1, V=5, X=10,
L=50, C=100, D=500, and M=1000. Like in the case of Arabic numerals, the decimal digits of
a number to be represented with a Roman numeral are translated into Roman notation from left to
right, starting with the most significant and finishing with the least significant digit. For example, the
number 1111 is written as MCXI, and 1055 is written as MLV. As the second example shows, the digit
0 does not appear.

To translate a digit not defined by one of the basic capital letters, a system based on repetition and
addition is used. For example, III=3, XXXII=32, and MMVIII=2008. Only the letters I, X, C,
and M can be repeated, and it does not make sense to repeat a letter more than four times because
there is a shorter version for that (i.e., the expressions L and LX must be used instead of XXXXX and
XXXXXX, respectively).

The final rule states that no symbol can appear more than three times in a row, which happens
whenever one of the decimal digits is a 4 or a 9. In those cases, a subtraction system must be used
by combining the problematic symbol with a greater one. For example, 44 should not be written as
XXXXIIII but as XLIV ((50  10) + (5  1) = 44). Note that I can only be placed at most once
before V or X, X can only be placed at most once before L or C, and C can only be placed at most
once before D or M. Because of this, the largest number that can be written using standard Roman
numerals is MMMCMXCIX (3000 + (1000  100) + (100  10) + (10  1) = 3999) and one should refrain
from writing it as IMMMM.

The problems for Emperor Tiberius started when he designed all the road signs forgetting the final
rule (e.g., instead of writing XLIV, he wrote XXXXIIII). Many unnecessary letters were carved into
the stone signs and the empire run into large overhead costs. For the sake of keeping his name among
the greatest emperors of Rome, Tiberius wishes to amend his error. He has hired you to help him fixing
his mistake. You must write a program that, given a Roman numeral, written forgetting the final rule
(as Tiberius would write it), reports two integers e and c where e is the number of letters that must
be erased and c is the number of letters that must be carved to transform that numeral into that one
written using all the stated rules. If there are multiple solutions, your program must print the answer
that minimizes the value of e+ c. If still there are two or more solutions minimizing e+ c, the one that
minimizes the value of e must be printed.

For example, considering a sign with the Roman numeral MMMDCCCCLXXXXVIIII (3999), it is easy
to see that the minimum number of operations needed to fix it is e + c = 17: e = 13 erased letters
plus c = 4 new carved letters. The following artifact shows both the original Roman numeral and the
corrected one. Erased letters have been marked with an e above the original numeral and the new
carved letters with a c under the corrected one.

Note that it is not allowed to leave blank spaces inside a Roman numeral, and that every letter uses
the same space when carved (i.e., all letters are written using a fixed-width font).
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several lines, each one containing one Roman numeral written forgetting the final
rule. No blanks are found on any of these lines. Input ends with a line containing a single asterisk (*).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each Roman numeral given in the input, output a single line with two non-negative integer numbers
e and c, separated by one blank, where e is the number of erased letters and c is the number of new
carved letters that solve the problem.

CCCII
CCCCIII
CCCCXXXX
XXXXVIIII
MMMDCCCCLXXXXVIIII
