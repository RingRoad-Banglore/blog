```
These days, it has become common-
place to make purchases over the in-
ternet using a credit card. However,
because credit card numbers are rela-
tively long, it is easy to make a mis-
take while typing them in. In order to
quickly identify errors like typos, most
e-commerce websites use a checksum
algorithm to verify credit card num-
bers.

One popular checksum algorithm
is the Luhn algorithm, which can de-
tect any single-digit error as well as
many common multiple-digit errors:

1. Starting with the second-last digit and moving backwards, double every other digit to obtain a
list of numbers.

2. Add up the digits of these numbers, then add the undoubled digits from the original number.
Sum the two results.

3. If the total ends in a 0, the credit card number is valid, and it is invalid otherwise.

For example, using the number 5181 2710 9900 0012:

1. Double the appropriate digits (5181 2710 9900 0012) to obtain the values: 10, 16, 4, 2, 18, 0, 0,
2.

2. Add up the digits of these values to get (1+0) + (1+6) + 4 + 2 + (1+8) + 0 + 0 + 2 = 25. The
sum of the undoubled digits is 1+1+7+0+9+0+0+2 = 20, so the total is 20+25=45.

3. 45 does not end in a 0, so this credit card number is invalid.

For this problem, you must write a program that checks the validity of credit card numbers according
to the Luhn algorithm.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a number N on a single line, followed by N lines each containing a single credit
card number. Each credit card number consists of 16 decimal digits in groups of four separated by
single spaces.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of one line for each input credit card number. If the credit card number is valid,
this line consists of the string Valid, otherwise it reads Invalid.
