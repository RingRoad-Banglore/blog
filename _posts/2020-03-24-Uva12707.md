## Input

```

Everybody knows Korimbai. Though he does not have time for any one. He is a legend in his own.
Now once Korimbai got very angry with the puny humans around him. He decided to block them

on his social networking website Korimboi. ( Korimboi is very popular website among puny humans,
every one of you have 1 or more account on that, though people do not know about the actual creator
( Korimbai ) / actual name ( Korimboi ) of the site, because as always Korimbai has no time for that.)

Korimbai is a strange man, so he wants to block them in a strange way. As the creator of korimboi
he has this special power of blocking more than 1 people at 1 click. He does that in the following way.

He chooses one puny human given that puny humans entrance and exit time be S1 and E1 respec-
tively in Korimadda (Chat client in Korimboi) and selects it for blocking. Then he finds another puny
human whose entrance time and exit time be S2 and E2 respectively. He can select it if and only if
S2 > S1 and E2 < E1. Now he search for another puny human whose entrance time and exit time be
S3 and E3 respectively and S3 > S2 and E3 < E2. He continues this search until there are nobody
available in those criteria that Si > Si1 and Ei < Ei1. Then he blocks all of them at once in one
click.

Now Korimbai wants to give this puzzle to you for your brain exercise (of course he knows the
answer. He is THE Korimbai, but he has no time for that). He wants to know that given all the
entrance and exit time for the puny humans in his korimadda list what is the minimum number of click
Korimbai needs to give to delete all of the puny humans of his list.
