```
Student Peter was playing billiard all the term and for that reason he missed all his lectures. Unfortu-
nately thats the time for term exams which Peter must pass.

Peter has N (1  N  10) courses, because he completely failed the previous term exams so he has
to pass them too. He is already late with his exams and the deadline is coming. He agreed with all
teachers to pass all the exams in one day. The idea he followed is  Everything or nothing. After he
made some considerations and an assumption that well play billiard only 5 hours a day, he counted
the number of hours he has left to get himself prepared for exams. He has concluded that he has M
(0 < M  100) hours to get prepared. While he is preparing he has to read at least the name of the
subject he is preparing for. Because of this difficult task hes preparing for at least one hour for each
exam. If he has no time to prepare for exam  he fails it.

Exam is evaluated using 10-grade system. To pass an exam Peter has to receive at least 5. Also
Peter is a greedy person and he wants to have the highest average mark that is possible.

As Peter is perfectly aware of his abilities he made a table L. Each line of this table represents a
course and each column represents a number of hours Peter is preparing for a particular exam. Element
Lij of the table means, that for i-th exam Peter devotes j-th hours of his available time. It is known that
the more Peter is getting prepared for a particular exam the highest mark he receives, i.e. Lij = Lij+1
for each 1  i  N ir 1  j  M  1.

Suddenly Peter remembers that he has a good friend. Youre actually the person he remembered.
So as he is completely desperate he asks for your help! Help Peter in his mission of passing exams and
achieving the maximum possible average mark.
