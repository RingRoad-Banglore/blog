## Input

Bangladesh Photographic Society is planning to arrange a Photographic Competition in Bangladesh.
The topic of this competition is The Nature of Bangladesh. But their idea is little bit unusual. For
each photographer, the organizer will provide a set of tickets of different prices and in a particular order,
to travel and take pictures from various locations around Bangladesh. Photographers can travel from
one place to another if the price of the ticket is same as the traveling cost between these two places.
All the invited photographers have to collect these tickets from Dhaka and will start their journey from
there. The participants may choose any route to the final destination - Coxs Bazar where the final
event is to be held. To make this tour simple (or complicated ) the organizing committee has set some
rules for this tour. All competitors will receive same set of tickets from the organizer. During their
tour the photographers must use all the tickets in the order as they are given. The photographers can
also travel to any place more than once but they have to reach at Coxs Bazar using the final ticket.
Otherwise, they will be disqualified from the competition. Now the organizing committee wants to
know the number of places (including Dhaka and Coxs Bazar) it is possible for the participants to visit
during their tour. So, as a programmer they want your help.

## Output

```text
There will be a set of test cases. Each test case starts with 2 numbers: N , E where N (2  N  100)
represents the number of places in Bangladesh, E represents the connecting roads among these places.
After that there will be E lines, each containing 3 numbers (x, y, z) which means that the traveling cost
from place x to place y and place y to place x is z (0  z  100000). The first number T (T  100) of
the next line represents the number of tickets that each photographer will get from the organizer. After
that there will be T numbers which represents the price of the tickets that a competitor has to use
sequentially during his tour. Input will be terminated when N = E = 0 and should not be processed.
(For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that Dhaka is denoted by place 0 and Coxs Bazar is denoted
by place N  1).

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, there will be one line of output which contains the serial of output followed by an
integer which represents the number of places where it is possible for any competitor to reach between
the path from Dhaka (place 0) to Coxs Bazar (place N  1). If it is not possible to reach from Dhaka
to Coxs Bazar using these tickets, your output should be 0. Look at the output for sample input for
details.
