## Input

```text
As Jacques-douard really likes birthday cakes, he celebrates his
birthday every hour, instead of every year. His friends ordered
him a round cake from a famous pastry shop, and placed can-
dles on its top surface. The number of candles equals the age of
Jacques-douard in hours. As a result, there is a huge amount of
candles burning on the top of the cake. Jacques-douard wants
to blow all the candles out in one single breath.

You can think of the flames of the candles as being points
in the same plane, all within a disk of radius R (in nanometers)
centered at the origin. On that same plane, the air blown by
Jacques-douard follows a trajectory that can be described by a
straight strip of width W , which comprises the area between two
parallel lines at distance W , the lines themselves being included
in that area. What is the minimum width W such that Jacques-
douard can blow all the candles out if he chooses the best orientation to blow?
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line consists of the integers N and R, separated with a space, where N is Jacques-douards
age in hours. Then N lines follow, each of them consisting of the two integer coordinates xi and yi of
the i-th candle in nanometers, separated with a space.

Limits

 3  N  2  105;

 10  R  2  108;

 for 1  i  N , x2i + y
2
i  R

2;

 all points have distinct coordinates.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.

Print the value W as a floating point number. An additive or multiplicative error of 105 is tolerated:
if y is the answer, any number either within [y  105; y + 105] or within [(1 105)y; (1 + 105)y] is
accepted.

```
