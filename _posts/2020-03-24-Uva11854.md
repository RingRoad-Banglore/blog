triangles have a similar property.

containing 0 0 0. Each test case has three positive
integers, less than 30,000, denoting the lengths of the
sides of a triangle.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, a line containing right if the tri-
angle is a right triangle, and a line containing wrong
if the triangle is not a right triangle.
