title: Uva 10598  Find the Latitude
---


## Input

```text
We are dealing with a very well known problem here. A man lives in a hut. On one fine morning he
wakes up goes n km to the north, and then he goes n km to the east and then he goes n km to the
south to reach his hut again. Your job is to determine the latitude of his hut. You can assume that the
man lives on a planet which is a perfect sphere and the man can walk at any location of his planet (no
seas, no mountains, no check points, only plain land). If there is more than one solution you just need
to find the first 10 smaller solutions. One obvious solution is the south pole. We dont need that.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several lines of inputs. Each line contains two integers R (0 < R < 100000) and
n (R/100  n  R/8). Here R is the radius of earth in km and n is the distance covered in km in each
journey as described in the problem statement. Input is terminated by a line where R = 0 and n = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input first produce the serial of the output as shown in the sample output. Then
produce at most 10 lines, which contain the latitude of the mans house in degree. The degree values
should have five digits after the decimal point.
Hint:

Consider a parallel on the northern Hemi-
sphere that has a circumference of n mile (Par-
allel A in the figure on the right). We can select
an arbitrary point on this parallel, move one
mile south to another parallel (parallel B in fig-
ure on the right). This is a possible position of
the mans tent. I mean the mans tent can be
anywhere on this parallel. Other such parallel
can be found using similar approach.

## Sample Output

```text
1000 10
1000 20
0 0

```
