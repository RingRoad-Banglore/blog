title: Uva 10459  The Tree Root
---


## Input

```
Tree is an important data structure. Searching is a basic operation in any data structure. In a tree
searching mainly depends on its height. Consider the following three trees.

If you observe carefully, you will see that all trees are same except different nodes are used as roots.
Here the height of the tree varies with the selection of the root. In the 1st tree root is 2 and height
is 3. In 2nd one root is 1 and height is 2. And in last one root is 4 and height is 4. We will call 1
best root as it keeps the tree with the least possible height and 4 worst root for the opposite reason.

In this problem, you have to find out all best roots and worst roots for a given tree.
```

## Output

```
Each dataset starts with a positive integer N (3  N  5000), which is the number of nodes in the
tree. Each node in the tree has a unique id from 1 to N . Then successively for each ith node there
will be a positive integer K[i] following id of K[i] nodes which are adjacent to i. Input is terminated
by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset print two lines. In the 1st line show all the best roots in ascending order and in next
line show all worst roots in ascending order. See sample output for exact format.

2 2 3
3 1 6 7
3 1 4 5
