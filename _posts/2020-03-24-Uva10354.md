## Input

```
Imagine that like me you are also an idle but reasonably good programmer. On one fine morning you
wake up from sleep and discover that your bed is such a lovely place and you must not leave it for
the miserable place called office. So you just pick up your mobile phone, call your boss with a gloomy
voice and tell him that you are quite sick. Your boss is a very strict but sympathetic person and so
he grants you leave via phone. As the day grows old you discover that you must go out for shopping.
But you are afraid that your boss might see you. So you need to know if there is any safe option to
reach the market. You know that your boss stays only in two places, his residence and the office. While
going from one place to another he uses a path that does not cost more than any other path. So you
must avoid such paths and even places that your boss may reach. Your boss must not see you outside
your home. You can assume that the cost of reaching another location in the same place is zero and
you must go outside your home to reach market and your boss must come outside to reach home (from
office) or office (from home). As your job is at stake so you cannot take any chances.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several sets of input. Each set of input starts with six integers P , R, BH, OF ,
Y H and M . Here

P = Total number of places. (0 < P  100)
R = Total number of connecting roads. (0  R  4950)
BH = The Place where your boss lives. (0 < BH  P )
OF = The place where your office is situated. (0 < OF  P )
Y H = The place where your home is situated. (0 < YH  P )
M = The place where the market is situated. (0 < M  P )

Next R lines contain description of the city. Each line contains three integers p1, p2 and d. These
three integers denote that place p1 and place p2 is connected by a road whose cost is d. Here (0 < p1,
p2  P ) and d is a positive integer less than 101. Streets are all bi-directional. You can assume that
two different places are connected by only one road. Input is terminated by end of file.
