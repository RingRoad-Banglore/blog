title: Uva 11444  Sum
---


## Input

```
You have a sequence of length n. The element of this sequence is seq[i] (i = 1 to n).

Now consider a function

F (k, a, b) =


seq[i]  (i a+ 1)k for each i between a to b inclusive.
Given a sequence of length n you have to calculate F (k, a, b).
```

## Output

```
First line contains T (1  T  5) the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1  n  100000).
The next line contains n integers seq[1] to seq[n]. Each of these integer is in the range from 0 to

1000000000 inclusive.
Next line contains an integer q (q  10000) the number of queries.
Each of the next q lines contains 3 integers k,a,b. k is between 0 to 20 inclusive. 1  a  b  n.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each of the query k,a,b output contains 1 integer in each line the value of F (k, a, b) mod 1000000009.
