11276 Magical Seven
7 is a very special number. It is the smallest number that can’t be represented as a sum of fewer
than four non-zero squares. It is also the smallest happy number greater than 1. 7 is considered to be
magical in many cultures. In this problem, you will discover the amazing hidden magic of 7 in graph
theory :-).

Given a grid graph G, with dimensions 7× n, as shown below (the vertices are at the center of the
grid cells). Compute the last 4 digits of A+B + C, where

A = The total number of different Perfect matchings of G. A Perfect matching is a matching which
covers all vertices of G.

B = The total number of different Hamiltonian cycles of G. A Hamiltonian cycle visits each vertex
exactly once and comes back to the original vertex.

C = The total number of different Spanning subgraphs of G, such that every connected component
of each Spanning subgraph is a cycle.

## Input
The input will consist of at most 100 lines with the value of n on each line. All numbers fit into unsigned
64 bit integers.

## Output
For each line of input, output the answer on a single line. If there are fewer than 4 digits in A+B+C,
pad to 4 digits with leading 0’s, otherwise output the last 4 digits as described above.
