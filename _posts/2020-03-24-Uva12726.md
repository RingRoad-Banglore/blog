## Input

```text

Bob is in love with Alice, a girl at his school. He always dreams of dating her, kissing her and playing
weird games with her. But he is too shy to talk to Alice, so he decided to approach her through the
internet first. He will start by adding her as a friend at LifeInvader (a very popular social network).
But people often find it weird to accept you as a friend if they dont know you, except when you have
at least K friends in common with them. So Bob has to add some of Alices friends first. To add them,
he has to add some of their friends too, and it goes on.

He finds it futile to have friends he doesnt really know at LifeInvader, so he wants to add the
minimum additional friends. Help him know the minimum number of friends he has to add to be able
to add Alice. Its possible that Bob is friends with Alice already in LifeInvader, and is just messing
with you.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains T (T  200)  the number of test cases, after this line T test cases follows. Each
test case starts with three integers N (2  N  20), M (0  M  N(N1)

2
) and K (0  K  N) 

the number of people in LifeInvader (including Bob and Alice), the number of current friendships and
the minimum number of common friends you must have with someone to be able to add that person as
a friend, correspondingly. Each person at LifeInvader is identified by a unique number between 1 and
N . Bob is 1 and Alice is N . Then, M lines follow, each one with two numbers A and B (1  A,B  N ,
A = B), meaning that persons A and B are currently friends.

```

## Sample Input

For each test case print a line containing Case #X: Y , where X is the case number, starting at 1,
