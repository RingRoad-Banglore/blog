title: Uva 12887  The Soldiers Dilemma
---


```
N soldiers are preparing for their parade. Each of them has different heights and they are standing
in a line. Their commander will order any three of them to step forward. All the other soldiers will
then leave the ground and selected three will stay. Now if from left to right these three soldiers order
is short, tall, medium then their commander will become furious and punish them. (Even if they
are medium, tall, short or in any other order from left to right they will not be punished) Now the
soldiers dont want to be punished. In how many ways can the N soldiers stand in a line that no matter
which three are chosen there order will never be short, tall , medium from left to right?
```

## Input

```
The first line contains number of test case T (1  T  500). Each of the next T lines contains an
integer N (1  N  5000).

```

## Output

```
For each of the test case you must output the number of ways N soldiers can stand in a line. As the
number can be very large output it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
