## Input

```text
The well-known physicist Alfred E Neuman is working on problems that involve multiplying polynomials
of x and y. For example, he may need to calculate

(x8y + 9x3  1 + y).(x5y + 1 + x3)

getting the answer

x13y2  x11y + 8x8y + 9x6  x5y + x5y2 + 8x3 + x3y  1 + y

Unfortunately, such problems are so trivial that the great mans mind keeps drifting off the job,
and he gets the wrong answers. As a consequence, several nuclear warheads that he has designed have
detonated prematurely, wiping out five major cities and a couple of rain forests.

You are to write a program to perform such multiplications and save the world.

## Output

```text
The file of input data will contain pairs of lines, with each line containing no more than 80 characters.
The final line of the input file contains a # as its first character. Each input line contains a polynomial
written without spaces and without any explicit exponentiation operator. Exponents are positive
non-zero unsigned integers. Coefficients are also integers, but may be negative. Both exponents and
coefficients are less than or equal to 100 in magnitude. Each term contains at most one factor in x and
one in y.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Your program must multiply each pair of polynomials in the input, and print each product on a pair
of lines, the first line containing all the exponents, suitably positioned with respect to the rest of the
information, which is in the line below.

The following rules control the output format:

1. Terms in the output line must be sorted in decreasing order of powers of x and, for a given power
of x, in increasing order of powers of y.

2. Like terms must be combined into a single term. For example, 40x2y3  40x2y3 is replaced by
2x2y3.

3. Terms with a zero coefficient must not be displayed.

4. Coefficients of 1 are omitted, except for the case of a constant term of 1.

5. Exponents of 1 are omitted.

6. Factors of x0 and y0 are omitted.

7. Binary pluses and minuses (that is the pluses and minuses connecting terms in the output) have
a single blank column both before and after.

8. If the coefficient of the first term is negative, it is preceded by a unary minus in the first column,
with no intervening blank column. Otherwise, the coefficient itself begins in the first output
column.

9. The output can be assumed to fit into a single line of at most 80 characters in length.

10. There should be no blank lines printed between each pair of output lines.

11. The pair of lines that contain a product should be the same length  trailing blanks should
appear after the last non-blank character of the shorter line to achieve this.
