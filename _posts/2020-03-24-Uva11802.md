```
It is very easy to find number of trailing zero in n! for a particular
base b. In this problem you have to do the reverse. You have to
find for how many bases b, n! has k trailing zeros in base b.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with a positive number T  10000, denoting the
number of test cases to follow.

Each test case contains two non-negative integers, n  1015
and 1  k  1015 in a line. You may assume that n/k < 500.

```

## Output

```
For each input output one line containing the number of different bases. Print the solution modulo
1000000007

```

## Sample Input

```
5
10 2
10 3
10 4
10 5
10 8

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 24
Case 2: 0
Case 3: 4
Case 4: 0
Case 5: 1
```
