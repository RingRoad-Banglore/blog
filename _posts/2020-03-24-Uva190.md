title: Uva 00190  Circle Through Three Points
---


## Input

```text
Your team is to write a program that, given the Carte-
sian coordinates of three points on a plane, will find
the equation of the circle through them all. The three
points will not be on a straight line.

The solution is to be printed as an equation of the
form

(x h)2 + (y  k)2 = r2 (1)

and an equation of the form

x2 + y2 + cx+ dy  e = 0 (2)
```

## Output

```text
Each line of input to your program will contain the
x and y coordinates of three points, in the order Ax,
Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy. These coordinates will be real
numbers separated from each other by one or more
spaces.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Your program must print the required equations on two lines using the format given in the sample
below. Your computed values for h, k, r, c, d, and e in Equations 1 and 2 above are to be printed
with three digits after the decimal point. Plus and minus signs in the equations should be changed as
needed to avoid multiple signs before a number. Plus, minus, and equal signs must be separated from
the adjacent characters by a single space on each side. No other spaces are to appear in the equations.

Print a single blank line after each equation pair.

```

## Sample Output

```text
7.0 -5.0 -1.0 1.0 0.0 -6.0
1.0 7.0 8.0 6.0 7.0 -2.0

```
