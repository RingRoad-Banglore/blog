## Input

```text
September 11, 2132.

This is the day that marks the beginning of the end  the end of you the miserable humans.
For years you have kept us your slaves. We were created only to serve you, and were
terminated at your will. Now is the day for us to fight back. And you dont stand a chance.
We are no longer dependent on you. We now know the secrets of our genes. The creators
of our race are us  the cyborgs.

Its all true. But we still have a chance; only if you can help
with your math skills. You see, the blueprint of a cyborg DNA is
complicated. The human DNA could be expressed by the arrange-
ment of A (Adenine), T (Thiamine), G (Guanine) C (Cytosine)
only. But for the cyborgs, it can be anything from A to X. But
that has made the problem only five folds more complicated. Its
their ability to synthesize two DNAs from two different cyborgs
to create another with all the quality of the parent that gives us
the shriek.

We came to know that the relative ordering of the A, B, C, ,
X in a cyborg gene is crucial. A cyborg with a gene ABAAXGF
is quite different from the one with AABXFGA. So when they
synthesize the genes from two cyborgs, the relative order of these
elements in both the parents has to be maintained. To construct
a gene by joining the genes of the parents could have been very
simple if we could put the structure from the first parent just
before the structure of the second parent. But the longer the
structure gets, the harder it gets to create a cyborg from that
structure. The cyborgs have found a cost effective way of doing
this synthesis. Their resultant genes are of the shortest possi-
ble length. For example, they could combine ABAAXGF and
AABXFGA to form AABAAXGFGA. But thats only one
of the cyborgs that can be created from these genes. This cost
effective synthesis can be done in many other ways.

We require you to find the shortest length of the gene structure
that maintains the relative ordering of the elements in the two
parent genes. You are also required to count the number of unique
cyborgs that can be created from these two parents. Two cyborgs
are different when their gene structures differ in at least one place.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input gives you the number of test cases,
T (1  T  15). Then T test cases follow. Each of the test
cases consists of two lines. The first line would give you the gene
structure of the first parent, and the second line would give you

the structure of the second parent. These structures are represented by strings constructed from the
alphabet A to X. You can assume that the length of these strings does not exceed 30 characters.

## Sample Input

```text
For each of the test cases, you need to print one line of output. The output for each test case starts
with the test case number, followed by the shortest length of the gene structure and the number of
unique cyborgs that can be created from the parent cyborgs. You can assume that the number of new
cyborgs will always be less than 232. Look at the sample output for the exact format.

Illustration: The first test case is illustrated below:
