## Input

```
Sigma function is an interesting function in Number Theory. It is denoted by the Greek letter Sigma
(). This function actually denotes the sum of all divisors of a number. For example (24) = 1 + 2 +
3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 60. Sigma of small numbers is easy to find but for large numbers it is very
difficult to find in a straight forward way. But mathematicians have discovered a formula to find sigma.

n , then

For some n the value of (n) is odd and for others it is even. Given a value n, you will have to find
how many integers from 1 to n have even value of .

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 100 lines of inputs.

Each line contains an integer N (0 < N < 1000000000001).
Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line denotes how many numbers between 1 and
N (inclusive) has even value of function .
