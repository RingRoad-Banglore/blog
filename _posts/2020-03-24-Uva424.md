title: Uva 00424  Integer Inquiry
---


## Input

```
One of the first users of BITs new supercomputer was Chip Diller. He extended his exploration of
powers of 3 to go from 0 to 333 and he explored taking various sums of those numbers.

This supercomputer is great, remarked Chip. I only wish Timothy were here to see these results.
(Chip moved to a new apartment, once one became available on the third floor of the Lemon Sky
apartments on Third Street.)
```

## Output

```
The input will consist of at most 100 lines of text, each of which contains a single VeryLongInte-
ger. Each VeryLongInteger will be 100 or fewer characters in length, and will only contain digits (no
VeryLongInteger will be negative).

The final input line will contain a single zero on a line by itself.

```

## Sample Input

```
Your program should output the sum of the VeryLongIntegers given in the input.
