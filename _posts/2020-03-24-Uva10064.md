title: Uva 10064  Traveling in another dimension
---


## Input

```
Many of us would like to break the barrier of dimensions but the fact is that this is not that easy. Some
consider Time as the fourth dimension and many others have other ideas. Some just ignore the concept
of time. Our scientist friend Arnold has discovered some ways to travel in four dimensions. But the
problem is that he being a three-dimensional animal has to spend more energy to go from one point to
another in four-dimensional space and this energy is proportional to the square of the distance between
the two points. Arnold has taken many of his friends to the four-dimensional world. The problems they
face are:

a) Safety problem: The four-dimensional creatures come from nowhere and hit them. It is very
difficult for them to track the four-dimensional creatures.

b) Losing way: They always lose their way in the four dimensions.

To avoid this problems they have made a tracking device and has discovered the moving paths of
the four dimensional creatures and also has discovered a straight line (a four dimensional straight line
is of the form Aw + Bx+ Cy +Dz + E = 0) which is very safe. They have started building house on
or beside the line. They have transformed the coordinate system along the safe line and uses a single
dimensional coordinate system on the line. So if two points has coordinates d1 and d2 the distance
between them is |d1  d2| and the cost to go from one point to another is proportional to the square
of the distance between them. Now given the coordinates of Arnolds friends houses you have to find
out the coordinate of Arnolds house. Arnold builds his house in such a place from where his effort of
visiting his friends house will be minimum. Initially Arnold is in his home. Arnold visits a friends
house, stops there and then returns home, stops there and then go to another friends house and so
on. His final position is also in his home. Note that as they are all three-dimensional creatures so their
houses are also three-dimensional. So in the same place in four dimensions there can be more than one
house. Another important thing here is that Arnold stops in every house. If he had not done that he
would have required more energy.

## Output

```
The input contains several blocks. Each block contains an integer N (0  N  10000) indicating the
number of Arnolds friends in the four dimensions and then contains the N coordinates of their houses.
The input is terminated by the end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output contains Arnolds coordinate if when Arnold stops at each house and when his voyage is
continuous (He starts from his home follows the same path as before but never stops anywhere). These
two coordinates will be separated by a single space. If Arnolds coordinates cannot be determined print
a -1 (minus one). (Note that if one coordinate is found the other will also be found) The outputs for
each block will be in separate lines. The output format is shown in the sample output. If there are
more than one such places (in the first case or in the second case) print the smallest coordinate.

Note: Explanation, why Arnold needs more energy if he does not stop at each house:
Lets assume that Arnold is going from point A to point C

A----------------------- B -------------------- C

If he does not stop at B he will require an energy proportional to AC  AC. If he stops at B and
then goes to C then he will need energy proportional to (AB  AB +BC BC). You dont have to be
magician to prove that (AB  AB + BC  BC) < (AC  AC). Change of direction does not cost any
energy.
