title: Uva 10275  Guess the Number!
---


## Input

```text
In this problems, well talk about BIG numbers. Yes, Im sorry, big numbers again.... Let N be a
positive integer, we call S = NN the big big power of N . In this time, I will calculate the exact value
of S for a positive integer N . Then, I tell you S, you guess N .

Note that I may make mistakes in calculating, but I promise that if Im wrong, my result and
the correct result will differ in exactly one single digit, and the number of digits is always correct (no
missing or extra digits). That means, I will NOT get terribly wrong result such as 3456 or 111.
```

## Output

```text
The first line in the input contains a positive integer T indicating the number of test cases (1  T  10).
Each case consists of a single line containing the exact value of S. The line does not contain any
character apart from digits (0,1,2,...,9), and will have at most 500,000 digits. Input integers do NOT
contain leading zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print on a single line the value of N if a unique N satisfying NN = S can be found.
Otherwise, print -1 in the corresponding line, showing that I made a mistake in calculating.

```

## Sample Output

```text

3225
