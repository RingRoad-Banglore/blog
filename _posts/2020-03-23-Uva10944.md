10944 Nuts for nuts..
So as Ryan and Larry decided that they don’t really taste
so good, they realized that there are some nuts located in
certain places of the island.. and they love them! Since
they’re lazy, but greedy, they want to know the shortest
tour that they can use to gather every single nut!

Can you help them?

## Input
You’ll be given x, and y, both less than 20, followed by x
lines of y characters each as a map of the area, consisting
sorely of ‘.’, ‘#’, and ‘L’. Larry and Ryan are currently lo-
cated in ‘L’, and the nuts are represented by ‘#’. They can
travel in all 8 adjacent direction in one step. See below for
an example. There will be at most 15 places where there
are nuts, and ‘L’ will only appear once.

## Output
On each line, output the minimum amount of steps starting
from ‘L’, gather all the nuts, and back to ‘L’.

Note: In the sample below, Larry and Ryan will go south
for a nut, then south again for another nut, then south twice
for another nut, and then back where they are.
