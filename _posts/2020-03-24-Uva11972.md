title: Uva 11972  Round Trip
---


## Input

```text
John recently has had his birthday party. As John likes traveling, all invited guests cooperated and
decided to buy various tickets as a present. Each ticket can be used only once to travel from some city
A to city B or vice versa. As guests were cooperating, they decided that no tickets will be between the
same cities.

Now John has huge amount of tickets and needs to plan his trip. But first, he wishes to know the
cities that now he can possibly visit and come back home. In other words you have to find all cities
John can visit by making a round trip from the home city through that particular city.
```
