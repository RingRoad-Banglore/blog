title: Uva 10845  The crusades

## Input

```
The Pope has commissioned the Holy Roman Empire, ruled by ruthless King Frederick Barbarossa (Red
Beard), and England, lead by brave King Richard the Lionheart, to recover the holy land of Jerusalem
from the moors.

Both commanders know very well their armies cannot meet on a road, or a quarrel may break out.
They therefore wish to take different paths to get to Jerusalem, which means no road will be chosen
by both king for their troops to march by. Soldiers from both bands may meet at towns and cities,
however, where they will probably not mind each other.

There is another difficulty: some paths are narrow and a limited number of soldiers can march
across them. To deal with this problem, both commanders are willing to divide their troops into as
many groups as it is needed in order to ensure that the greatest number of soldiers (no matter which
kingdom they belong to) will arrive at Jerusalem to fight the moors.

Given a map of towns and cities connected by roads which can admit a certain number of soldiers
and the initial position of King Frederick&rsquo;s and King Richard&rsquo;s troops (which are always
different), your task is to determine the largest number of soldiers that can get to Jerusalem.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains the number t of test cases (1  t  60). Each test case will begin with
a line containing integers N and M (5  N  12 and 5  M  30) corresponding to the number of
towns and the number of roads in the map. Towns will be numbered from 1 to N . M lines follow, each
containing integers A, B and C (1  A,B  N and 1  C  100), indicating that there is a two-way
road from town A to town B by which at most C soldiers can march. The last line of each case will
contain integers F , R and J (1  F,R, J  N) corresponding to the initial locations of Fredericks
army, Richards army and Jerusalem, which will always be different.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print on a separate line the largest number of soldiers that can get to Jerusalem.
