title: Uva 11026  A Grouping Problem
---


## Input

```text
You are given a set of N integers. You can take K different elements from them to make a group. Two
groups will be different if there is at least one element which is not common to both. For example, if
there are 4 elements a, b, c, d and you are asked to take two elements then ab, ad, bc, cd are all valid
and different groups. A grouping system is complete if for a particular K, number of different groups
is the maximum. In the former case, {ab, bc, cd, bd, ad, ac} is a complete grouping system.

For a particular complete grouping system, the fitness is calculated in the following way

1. Each group of a grouping system contributes a part the multiplication of all numbers of that
group

2. Contribution from all groups are added

3. The fitness is equivalent to Total Contribution mod M , M is the bounding parameter

In our example, for K = 2, the fitness is F2 = (ab+ bc+ cd+ bd+ ad+ ac) mod M . If K = 1, then
fitness is F1 = (a+ b+ c+ d) mod M .

Here, in this problem you have to find the complete grouping system with maximum fitness.
```

## Output

```text
Each test case starts with two positive integer N (2  N  1000) and M (1  M < 231). In next few
lines there will be N positive integers. Each integer will be at best 1000. Input will be terminated by
a case where N = M = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print in a line the maximum fitness possible for a grouping system.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4 10
1 2 3 4
4 100
1 2 3 4
4 6
1 2 3 4
0 0

```
