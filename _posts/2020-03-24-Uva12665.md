title: Uva 12665  Joking with Fermats Last Theorem
---


## Input

```text

Fermats Last Theorem: no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation an + bn = cn

for any integer value of n greater than two.
From the theorem, we know that a3 + b3 = c3 has no positive integer solution.
However, we can make a joke: find solutions of a3 + b3 = c3. For example 43 + 93 = 793, so a = 4,

b = 9, c = 79 is a solution.
Given two integers x and y, find the number of solutions where x  a, b, c  y.
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 10 test cases. Each test case contains a single line: x, y (1  x  y  108).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the number of solutions.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1 10

1 20

123 456789

```
