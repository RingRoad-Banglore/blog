```
From the figure on the right, it is clear that C1,
C2 and C3 circles are touching each other.

Consider,
C1 circle have R1 radius.
C2 circle have R2 radius.
C3 circle have R3 radius.
Write a program that will calculate the area

of shaded region G
```

## Input

```
The first line will contain an integer k (1  k 
1000) which is the number of cases to solve.
Each of the following k Lines will contain three
floating point number R1 (1  R1  1000), R2
(1  R2  1000) and R3 (1  R3  1000).

```

## Output

```
For each line of input, generate one line of out-
put containing the area of G rounded to six
decimal digits after the decimal point. Floating-point errors will be ignored by special judge program.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
5.70 1.00 7.89
478.61 759.84 28.36

```

## Sample Output

```
1.2243
2361.0058
