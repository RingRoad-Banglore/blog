## Input

```text
Experiments are a very significant part of various branches of Physics such as light, sound or heat. Now
in a world famous underground physics laboratory, a heat experiment is being carried on. They have
gas particles filled in an otherwise empty straight-lined glass rod. All the particles are on the same
horizontal plane & able to travel only left or right. To be more specific, a particle can move 1 unit
distance per second on either direction or may not move at all.

Now, for the experiment, one side of the glass rod is heated by a burner, lets assume this will
always be the left side. The heat is immediately transferred to the left most particle and at the same
time, the particles start to move. Remember that, after this time any particle can move 1 unit distance
to right or left every second or lay unmoved at a particular second. We shall also assume that, at the
start of the experiment all particles were unheated & not moving. An important characteristics of this
gas particles are, multiple of them can reside in the same place.

Heat transfer takes place by radiation between two particles. If an unheated particle, at some point
comes at a distance of less than or equal to D units of a heated particle, it becomes heated. There is no
heat loss inside the experimental environment, so a particle once heated, will be heated forever. Given
the initial position of all the particles, you are to determine the minimum amount of seconds required
to have all the particles heated.

## Output

```text
The first line of every test case contains an integer N (1  N  10000), the number of particles in the
glass rod. Each of the next N lines has a floating point number, the unit distance of a particle from
the left side of the glass rod, given to 3 digits after the decimal point. The distances will always be
non-negative and less than or equal to 107. The last line of the case will be another floating point value,
D (0  D  1000), as described in the statement. D will have 3 digits after the decimal as well. The
last test case will be followed by a line with a single 0 denoting the end of input. This line should not
be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For every test case, print a line of of the form, Case X: Y , where X is the serial number of output
(starting from 1) and Y is the minimum time in seconds required to heat all the particles. The result,
Y should be printed upto 3 digits after decimal point. Output having difference by no more than 0.001
with the official output shall be considered as correct.
