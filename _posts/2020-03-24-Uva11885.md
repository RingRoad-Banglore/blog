title: Uva 11885  Number of Battlefields
---


```
In the previous problem, we assume the perimeter of the figure equals to p, how many battlefields are
possible? For example, there are no battlefields possible for p < 8, but two for p = 8:

Here are the nine battlefields for p=10:

Youre asked to output the number of battlefields modulo 987654321.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 25 test cases, each with a single integer p (1  p  109), the perimeter of the
battlefield. The input is terminated by p = 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a signle line, the number of battlefields, modulo 987654321.

```

## Sample Input

```
8
9
10
0

```

## Sample Output

```
2
0
9
```
