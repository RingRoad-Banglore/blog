## Input

```text

In one of his notebooks, Euclid gave a complex procedure for solving the following problem. With
computers, perhaps there is an easier way.

In a 2D plane, consider a line segment AB, another point C which is not collinear with AB, and a
triangle DEF. The goal is to find points G and H such that:

 H is on the ray AC (it may be closer to A than C or further away, but angle CAB is the same as
angle HAB)

 ABGH is a parallelogram (AB is parallel to GH, AH is parallel to BG)

 The area of parallelogram ABGH is the same as the area of triangle DEF
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset will consist of twelve real numbers, with no more than
3 decimal places each, on a single line. Those numbers will represent the x and y coordinates of points
A through F, as follows:

xA yA xB yB xC yC xD yD xE yE xF yF

Points A, B and C are guaranteed to not be collinear. Likewise, D, E and F are also guaranteed to
be non-collinear. Every number is guaranteed to be in the range from 1000.0 . . . 1000.0 inclusive.

End of the input will be a line with twelve zero values (0.0).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input set, print a single line with four floating point numbers. These represent points G and
H, like this:

xG yG xH yH

Print all values to a precision of 3 decimal places (rounded, NOT truncated). Print a single space
between numbers.
