---


```

Find the smallest integer N that has both of the following properties:

1. The binary representation of N has exactly P 1s & exactly Q 0s. (Leading Zeroes are allowed).

2. The number of 1s adjacent to one or more 0 in the binary representation is maximized.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains a single integer C, the number of test cases in the input file.
Each of the next C lines contains two non-negative integers P & Q (1  P +Q  50).

```

## Output

```
For each test case a print the value of N , as explained in the statement, in a line by itself.
