```
You probably dont know toys walk, play and talk when we are not around. And there are toys who
can perform intergalactic missions! But lets forget about alien planets now, the toyland on earth is in
danger, Zurg the evil emperor from outer world is planning to capture it. But as always when toyland
is in trouble the great space ranger Buzz Lightyear of star command comes for the rescue!

Toyland consists of several cities and bidirectional roads. The
Toyland chief wants to take following steps to save Toyland:

1. First divide the cities of Toyland into multiple regions. Two
cities MUST be included in same region if there is at least
one simple cyclic route connecting both cities. One city
can be included in multiple regions. Size of each region
should be maximal; that means extra city cant be added
in a region. Here simple cyclic route means no vertex should
appear more than one time in the route.

2. There are limited numbers of Buzz toys available. After
creating the regions, one Buzz toy will be sent to each of
them to save that region from Zurg!

Toys need energy to work. Each city can supply energy to infinite number of toys but the amount
of energy a city provides daily to a single toy is limited otherwise toys may waste energy. A toy is
assigned to a single region but it can get energy from any city within its region.

For a single toy, the total daily energy supply is the sum of the energy supply of all the cities within
its region.

Each Buzz may need different amount of energy to work. If a region provides too less energy than
additional energy need to be provided anyhow and it is considered as a loss. But if the region provides
more energy than required, Buzz wastes it by playing with laser and flying all around. So:

Daily Loss in region X = |Daily Energy required by Buzz assigned in that region
 Daily Energy supplied by region X|

Exactly one Buzz must be assigned in each region, if there are more toy than needed, theyll keep
them for emergency. The chief wants to minimize the maximum wastage among all the regions
and he needs your help desperately.

Help the toyland to survive, expand your mind To Infinity and Beyond and find the answer.

## Input

```
First line of input will contain the number of test cases T  600. For each case, first line will consist
of number of cities N (1  N  100), roads E and number of Buzz toys available B (1  B  50).
In next line there are N integers less than 1000, i-th integer denotes energy supply in city i. In next
line there are B integers less than 1000, j-th integer denotes energy required by Buzz j. Next there
are E lines each consisting two integer u and v denoting there is a bidirectional road between u and v
(u = v). There is at most one road between two cities. All inputs are non-negative.

## Output

```
For each test case first print number of regions. Then, if number of regions is more than number of
buzz available, output No; otherwise print the maximum wastage amount among all the regions. Print
case number for every case, see sample output for details.

Output Explanation: Regions and optimal assignment in 1st case:
