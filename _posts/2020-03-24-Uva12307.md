title: Uva 12307  Smallest Enclosing Rectangle
---


```
There are n points in 2D space. Youre to find a smallest enclosing rectangle of these points. By
smallest we mean either area or perimeter (yes, you have to solve both problems. The optimal
rectangle for these two problems might be different). Note that the sides of the rectangle might not be
parallel to the coordinate axes.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 10 test cases in the input. Each test case begins with a single integer n (3 
n  100, 000), the number of points. Each of the following n lines contains two real numbers x, y
(100, 000  x, y  100, 000), the coordinates of the points. The points will not be collinear. The last
test case is followed by a line with n = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line, print the area of the minimum-area enclosing rectangle, and the perimeter of the minimum-
perimeter enclosing rectangle, both rounded to two decimal places.

```
