## Input

```
Given the vertices of two triangles, check whether both of them have any common interior point. No
points on the edges or vertices are considered interior to a triangle.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer t (t  50) denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case
contains 12 integers which are the vertices of the triangles as (x, y) pair. First three pairs are for one
triangle and rest of them are for the other one. None of the triangles will be invalid. There is a blank
line before each test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input, print one line of output. Each line will contain yes if there are common interior points
between the two triangles, no otherwise. See the sample output for exact formatting.
