title: Uva 13116  Multistory Labyrinth
---


## Input

```text
Ada has found an old video game called multistory labyrinth. As its name indicates, the game consists
in a labyrinth (a field with multiple roads and walls where you should find a route from an origin point
to a destination point) with a little difference: This labyrinth is conformed for several floors (like a
building) where each floor belongs to the same labyrinth and you have elevators that connects different
floors. The source point and the destination point could be in any floor.

Each movement made by Ada in x, y or z (moving to north, sur, east, west, up or down a floor)
counts like a step. Ada is a strategic women and she doesnt want spend more steps than the necessary
to resolve the labyrinth. Can you make a program that compute the minimum number of steps required
to reach the end of the labyrinth?

The labyrinth is represented like a set of floors, and every floor is described as a grid with the next
conventions:

 # Represents a wall.

 . Represents a free square.

 - Represents an elevator (Can go up or down to the next floor if and only if the next floor have
an elevator in the same point). Elevators could be used as a free squares too, meaning that Ada
could pass through them without changing floor.

 S Starting point. Could be in any floor.

 E End point. Could be in any floor.

Example of one text case representing the first, second and third floor. The black squares denote
walls, the white free squares and those marked with an - are elevators.

Solution to the above proble. Each circle denotes an step. Note how from the first floor go to the
third and then down again to the first, reaching the end point in 13 steps.

## Output

```text
Input consist of multiple test cases. Each case starts with 3 integers l, w and h denoting respectively
the number of rows and columns of each floor of the labyrinth, followed by the number of floors
(1  w, l, h  100). After that will be the description of each one of the h floors (Starting from the
floor 1 and ending with the floor h). Each floor is conformed for w lines of l characters denoting the
floor with the conventions given in the exercise. It is guaranteed that there will be one and only one
character E and one and only one character S in the description of the building for each test case.
There is a blank space after the description of each floor. Input ends when l = 0, w = 0, h = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print a single line: the minimum number of steps needed to reach the end of the
labyrinth (or -1 if its not possible to find a way).
