## Input

```

Auto-mobile Charting & Manufacturing (ACM) is a company that specializes in manufacturing auto-
mobile spare parts. Being one of the leading automotive companies in the world, ACM are sure to keep
up the latest information in that world. In the 100-year anniversary of the company, ACM compiled a
huge list of range of prices of any automobiles ever recorded in the history. ACM then wants to develop
a program that they called Automobile Expert System or AES for short.

The program receives a price P as an input, and searches through the database for a car maker in
which P falls in their range of lowest price L and highest price H of car they ever made. The program
then output the car maker name. If the database contains no or more than one car maker that satisfies
the query, the program produce output UNDETERMINED (without quotes). Not so expert, huh? You are
about to develop that program for ACM.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a line containing an integer T (T  10), the number of test cases follow. Each
case begins with the size of the database D (D < 10000). The next each of D lines contains M , L
and H (0 < L < H < 1000000) which are the name of the maker (contains no whitespace and will
never exceeds 20 characters), the cars lowest price the maker ever made, and the cars highest price
the maker ever made respectively. Then there is the number of query Q (Q < 1000) follows. Each of
the next Q lines contains an integer P (0 < P < 1000000), the query price.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output for each query should be one line containing the name of the maker, or the string UNDETERMINED
(without quotes) if there is no maker or more than one maker that satisfies the query. You should
separate output for different case by one empty line.
