## Input

```text
Bicycle messengers who deliver documents and small items
to businesses have long been part of the guerrilla trans-
portation services in several major U.S. cities. The cyclists
of Boston are a rare breed of riders. They are notorious for
their speed, their disrespect for one-way streets and traffic
signals, and their brazen disregard for cars, taxis, buses,
and pedestrians.

Bicycle messenger services are very competitive. Billys
Bicycle Messenger Service is no exception. To boost its
competitive edge and to determine its actual expenses,
BBMS is developing a new scheme for pricing deliveries
that depends on the shortest route messengers can travel.
You are to write a program to help BBMS determine the
distances for these routes.

The following assumptions help simplify your task:

 Messengers can ride their bicycles anywhere at ground level except inside buildings.

 Ground floors of irregularly shaped buildings are modeled by the union of the interiors of rect-
angles. By agreement any intersecting rectangles share interior space and are part of the same
building.

 The defining rectangles for two separate buildings never touch, although they can be quite close.
(Bicycle messengers- skinny to a fault-can travel between any two buildings. They can cut the
sharpest corners and run their skinny tires right down the perimeters of the buildings.)

 The starting and stopping points are never inside buildings.

 There is always some route from the starting point to the stopping point.

Your program must be able to process several scenarios. Each scenario defines the buildings and
the starting and stopping points for a delivery route. The picture above shows a birds-eye view of a
typical scenario.
```

## Output

```text
The input file represents several scenarios. Input for each scenario consists of lines as follows:

First line: n
The number of rectangles describing the buildings in the scenario. 0  n  20

Second line: x1 y1 x2 y2
The x- and y-coordinates of the starting and stopping points of the route.

Remaining n lines: x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3
The x- and y-coordinates of three vertices of a rectangle.

The x- and y-coordinates of all input data are real numbers between 0 and 1000 inclusive. Successive
coordinates on a line are separated by one or more blanks. The integer -1 follows the data of the last
scenario.

## Sample Input

```text
Output should number each scenario (Scenario #1, Scenario #2, etc.) and give the distance of the
shortest route from starting to stopping point as illustrated in the Sample Output below. The distance
should be written with two digits to the right of the decimal point. Output for successive scenarios
should be separated by blank lines.
