title: Uva 01533  Moving Pegs
---


## Input

```

Venture MFG Company, Inc. has made a game
board. This game board has 15 holes and these holes
are filled with pegs except one hole. A peg can jump
over one or more consecutive peg s to the nearest
empty hole along the straight line. As a peg jump
over the pegs you remove them from the board. In
the following figure, the peg at the hole number 12 or
the peg at the hole number 14 can jump to the empty
hole number 5. If the peg at the hole number 12 is
moved then the peg at the hole number 8 is removed.
Instead, if the peg at the hole number 14 is moved
then the peg at the hole number 9 is removed.

Write a program which find a shortest sequence of moving pegs to leave the last peg in the hole that
was initially empty. If such a sequence does not exist the program should write a message IMPOSSIBLE.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T ) is given in the first line of the input
file. Each test case is a single integer which means an empty hole number.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the first line of the output file contains an integer which is the number of jumps
in a shortest sequence of moving pegs. In the second line of the output file, print a sequence of peg
movements. A peg movement consists of a pair o f integers separated by a space. The first integer of the
pair denotes the hole number of the peg that is moving, and the second integer denotes a destination
(empty) hole number.
