---


## Input

```
Taiwan baseball league and the sport division of the ministry of education of Taiwan are planning to
organize a major event with world baseball championship. After several rounds of discussions among
the members of the organizing committee, the details of the game plan are as follows.

1. There will be N teams invited to the competition, and N will be a power of 2. (N will also be
less than or equal to 128 and, of course, greater than 2.)

2. A round-robin competition and game schedule will be used. It means every team will play every
other team exactly once.

3. Two cities will collectively host the games. Kaohsiung and Taipei will be the two cities to host
the game, and Taipei Baseball Stadium and Kaohsiung Baseball Stadium (Lee-Der Stadium) will
be used as the game fields.

Please write a program to produce a schedule for the games. The schedule needs to satisfy the
following criteria.

a) The game schedule is round-robin. Suppose there are N teams to participate in the competition,
you need to schedule games to be played in exactly N  1 days. In each day of the competition,
every team will have to play exactly one game.

b) The games have to be scheduled evenly between Taipei and Kaohsiung. There will be equal
number of games to be played each day between Taipei and Kaohsiung in your produced schedule.

c) The organizing committee also hopes to reduce the total number of travellings for the teams.
Therefore, your schedule has to be the one with the minimum travellings for teams to travel
between Taipei and Kaohsiung. For example, if a team plays in Taipei in Day 1, and then the
same team plays in Kaohsiung in Day 2, we say that the travelling total is one. Your goal is to
produce a schedule so that the total travelling combined with all the teams is the minimum. The
fairness with the amount of travellings for each team is not required by the organizing committee.
We assume no travelling accounts in the first day of the game. The travelling total will be counted
from day 2 of the games.
