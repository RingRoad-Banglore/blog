title: Uva 12867  Mesh Cutter

```
Alan is building a small 3D modeling program that aims to be extremely
light-weight yet powerful enough to solve a large number of practical
problems. However, he is stuck with the knife operation: given a
mesh, a plane and a point, the knife operation cuts the mesh with the
plane, and removes the part that is in the same half-space as the point.

Knowing that programs written in ACM/ICPC competitions are
usually very compact, Alan comes for your help. In this problem, you
only need to deal with nice solid polygonal meshes (3D experts told
you that pure triangular meshes are too restrictive for editing), like this:

To be precise, nice means:

1. There will be no duplicated vertices/edges/faces.

2. Faces are planar convex polygons, usually triangles or quads.

3. The mesh is an orientable manifold without boundary.

4. The faces enclose a non-empty connected part of space (so we say its solid), and there will be
no hidden faces (i.e. no faces are invisible from outside).
For those of you who are unfamiliar with terms in point 3, it means:

5. Every edge is incident to exactly two faces. So when you walk across an edge from a face, you
will not directly reach the back side of that face (hence no boundary).

6. The faces incident to a vertex form a closed fan, see below. Note that if the faces form an open
fan, the boundary edges are violating point 7 because they are incident to only one face.

7. Its not something like the famous Mobius band.

Note that despite the nice properties above, those real-world meshes are still not easy to deal
with:

8. Two adjacent edges on a face can be collinear (but not overlapping).

9. Two adjacent faces (i.e. share a common edge) can be co-planar (but not overlapping).

10. The order of vertices in each face is either clockwise or counter-clockwise. That means the surface
normal either point towards or away from the solid.

Your task is to compute the volume, surface area of the meshes after cut, as well as the shape of
cross-section.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain at most 25 test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n, f (4  n  1, 000;
4  f  1, 000), the number of vertices and faces. Each of the following n lines contains three real
numbers x, y, z, the coordinates of the vertices. Each of the following f lines describes a face. Each
line contains a sequence of integers beginning with v (3  v  10), the number of vertices in the face
(vertices are numbered 1 to n), followed by a sequence of vertices in the face. The faces are guaranteed
to form a single connected solid.

The final line of each test case contains 12 real numbers: x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, x4, y4, z4 that
means the solid will be cut with the plane containing triangle P1(x1, y1, z1)P2(x2, y2, z2)P3(x3, y3, z3),
and you need to remove the half-space containing point P4(x4, y4, z4). It is guaranteed that P1P2P3 is
a valid triangle, and P4 is not on the plane of P1P2P3. Coordinates have absolute values not greater
than 100.

Important: coordinates will be either exact (like integers or finite real numbers like 0.5) or given with
enough precision, so you dont have to worry about precision problems like seemingly non-planar faces.
Furthermore, the distance between any mesh vertex and the cut-plane is at least 0.01, so dont worry
about degenerated cases.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and 5 lines. The first 3 lines are about the solids after cut.
Line 1: The number of connected solids after cut.
Line 2: The volumes of these solids, in decreasing order.
Line 3: The surface areas of these solids, in decreasing order.
It is guaranteed that the resulting solids will not touch each other. If nothing is left after cut, line

2 and line 3 should be empty.
Next two lines are about the cross-section.
Line 4: The number of connected regions in the cross-section.
Line 5: The areas of these connected regions, in decreasing order.

Note that adjacent co-planar faces in the cross-section should be considered as in the same connected
region. Beware that they may contain holes (and the holes can also enclose other connected regions).
If the cross-section is empty, line 5 should be empty.

All values representing volumes or areas should be rounded to 3 decimal places, and an absolute
error of up to 103 is allowed. It is guaranteed that all these volumes and areas are greater than 102.

Note: Be sure that your program can handle complex meshes like this one (one of judge test case):
