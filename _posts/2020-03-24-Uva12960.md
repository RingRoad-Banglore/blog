title: Uva 12960  Palindrome
---


## Input

```text
A palindrome is a string that if reversed is equal to the original string. In other words, it is a string
that, when read from back to front, is the same as the original string. For example, BANANAB is a
palindrome, while BANANAS is not. In this problem we are interested in a more interesting question.

Given a string S, we want to find a subsequence that is a palindrome. A subsequence is a string that
can be obtained from removing zero or more characters from the original string. For example ANNA
is a subsequence of BANANAS.

A set of positions of the string S, named special positions, will also be provided. Your task is to
find the size of the subsequence that is a palindrome and that includes the largest possible number of
special positions. In case there is more than one subsequence that maximizes the number of special
positions, you must output the size of the largest subsequence.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of a test case contains a string S of capital
letters with at least one and at most 2000 letters. The second line will contain an integer number N ,
0  N  |S|, indicating the number of positions that we are interested to include in the palindrome,
followed by N different numbers, between 1 and |S|, inclusive, describing the special positions of S.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case from the input your program should print one unique integer number, representing
the size of the biggest possible palindrome, as defined above.

```

## Sample Output

```text
BANANAS
0
BANANAS
1 7
ACDAAACX
3 2 3 8
MARATONA
4 3 1 5 2

```
