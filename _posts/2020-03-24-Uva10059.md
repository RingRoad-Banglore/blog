## Input

```
The department of Computer Science & Engineering of BUET is arranging a programming contest for
the young programmers of the department. The teachers have prepared eight problems for the contest.
The teachers have also written the judge solution for seven problems and after that they have gone
home to enjoy Christmas and EID Vacation. But the Head of the Department and also the BUET
contest team coach are still in the Department. They have discovered that the judge solution of one
question is still not written. But both of them are so exhausted with the preparation of the contest
that they have no strength to write the judge solution for another problem. Shahriar Manzoor a not so
young student of that department is then asked to write the solution and it is found out that he is not
as good a programmer as he pretends to be. He has no idea what so ever of how to solve the problem.
The problem is stated below. See if you can help out the exhausted teachers.

From a given point A, a person covered a certain distance d in a certain direction and reached a
point B and then he maintained that direction and reached a point C after he had covered a distance
e. Then he came back to point A and did the same thing covering the same amount of distances in
each step but may or may not be in another direction and got two similar points D and E. Here, D is
similar to B and E is similar to C. The point C, D and B, E are then connected. CD and BE intersects
at a point P (or in some case on a line P). The problem is that after one week that person forgot if the
distance e was measured from A or from B (in case of the second journey point D). He remembered one
thing that in both cases he followed the same strategy. He also discovered that if e < d he could assume
that the distance was not measured from A but in other cases he was unsure. Given the equation
of the line AC and AE and the value of d and e you will have to determine the equation of the line
AP (if possible). When there are infinite numbers of AP the determination of AP is impossible. The
determination of the equation of AP is also impossible when point A is at infinite distance. Keep one
thing in mind that the alphabetic symbols of this questions are case sensitive. That is A and a are
not the same. One of the angles between the two walking directions will be less than 180 degree.

## Output

```
The input contains and integer N at first, which is the number of test cases, then followed by N test
cases. Each test case contains two lines with three integers and one line with two integers. The two lines
with three integers contain the integers p, q, r and s, t, u (1000  p, q, r, s, t, u  1000) respectively
where the Equation of AC is px + qy + r = 0 and the equation of AE is sx + ty + u = 0 and the last
line with two integers are the values d (0  d = 1000) and e (0  e  1000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input output the coefficients of the equation of AP. The equation is of the form
x + by + c = 0 (when the absolute value of the coefficient of x is greater than the absolute value of
the coefficient of y or even equal) or of the form ax + y + c = 0 (in other cases). The output will be
in floating point format with three digits after the decimal. If the Equation of AP is not determinable
print the line Equation not found.

As a line denotes two directions so you may be confused which direction to take. In that case you
may get finite numbers of equations of AP. Print all those equations according to the rule specified
above, according to the sample output and in ascending order of their slopes. The numbers in the
output are separated by a single space.
