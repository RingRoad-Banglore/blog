title: Uva 12974  Exquisite Strings
---


```
Mr. Ed is a very sophisticated man and likes art very much, that is why he and his pals are visiting the
amazing museums of Paris. His favourite museum is the Muse dChane; it has a huge art collection,
but the masterpiece of the exhibition is a world famous string of n characters. Mr. Ed has spent hours
and hours looking for exquisite pairs of substrings inside the masterpiece.

A substring of a string S = s1s2 . . . sn, represented as Ti,j
for a pair of indexes i  j, is described as the concatenation
sisi+1 . . . sj1sj of characters from string S. Two substrings of S
are considered distinct if their indexes i and j are not the same.

The group does not want to observe a single string all day
long. In order to leave the museum as soon as possible, you want
to help Mr. Ed counting every pair of distinct substrings of the
exhibition string that are exquisite. If you dont have as much
artistic taste as Mr. Ed, a pair of strings is considered exquisite
if they share a common prefix of at least k characters.

If you dont have idea what a prefix is *sigh*, we define it as
a substring with starting index i equal to 1.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains a positive integer T representing the number of test cases.

The following T lines contain a non-empty string of 1  n  105 lowercase letters of the English
alphabet representing the museum exhibition string, followed by an integer number 1  k  n; the
length of the minimum prefix required in an exquisite pair of strings.

```

## Output

```
For each test case in the input, print a single line with an integer representing the number of exquisite
substring pairs, modulo 1,000,000,007 (109 + 7). See format below for details.
