## Input

```text
Given a positive integer N you will have to find two positive integers x and y such that:

N = x3  y3
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 100 lines of inputs. Each line contains a positive integer N (0 < N 
10000). Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one or more lines of output. Each of these lines contains two positive
integers x, y separated by a single space, such that N = x3  y3. If there is no such integer values of x
and y then produce the line No solution instead. If there is more than one solution then output the
one with smallest value of y.

```

## Sample Output

```text
7
37
12
0

```
