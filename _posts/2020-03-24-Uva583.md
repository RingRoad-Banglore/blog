## Input

```text
Webster defines prime as:

prime (prim) n. [ME, fr. MF, fem. of prin first, L primus; akin to L prior] 1: first in
time: original 2 a: having no factor except itself and one 3 is a  number b : having
no common factor except one 12 and 25 are relatively  3 a: first in rank, authority or
significance: principal b: having the highest quality or value  television time  [from
Websters New Collegiate Dictionary]

The most relevant definition for this problem is 2a: An integer g > 1 is said to be prime if and only
if its only positive divisors are itself and one (otherwise it is said to be composite). For example, the
number 21 is composite; the number 23 is prime. Note that the decompositon of a positive number g
into its prime factors, i.e.,

g = f1  f2      fn
is unique if we assert that fi > 1 for all i and fi  fj for i < j.

One interesting class of prime numbers are the so-called Mersenne primes which are of the form
2p  1. Euler proved that 231  1 is prime in 1772  all without the aid of a computer.

## Output

```text
The input will consist of a sequence of numbers. Each line of input will contain one number g in the
range 231 < g < 231, but different of -1 and 1. The end of input will be indicated by an input line
having a value of zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, your program should print a line of output consisting of the input number and
its prime factors. For an input number g > 0, g = f1  f2      fn, where each fi is a prime number
greater than unity (with fi  fj for i < j), the format of the output line should be
g = f1 x f2 x . . . x fn

When g < 0, if | g |= f1  f2      fn, the format of the output line should be
g = -1 x f1 x f2 x . . . x fn

```
