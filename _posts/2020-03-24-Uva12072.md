title: Uva 12072  Matrissor
---


```
Matrissor is a special kind of processor which can multiply a sequence of matrices in quick time. It has
certain capacity K which means the maximum number of computations (multiplications here) it can
perform at one step. For example if K is 1000, then it can multiply 2 matrices of 10  10 dimension. But
it cannot multiply a (10  11) matrix and another (11  10) matrix which require 1100 multiplications.
There is a limitation of matrissor. It cannot multiply a sequence of matrices optimally. If it is to
multiply m matrices, it processes first (m  1) matrices first and then multiples the resultant matrix
with mth matrix.

Your task is to multiply a sequence of matrices optimally using the matrissor with capacity K. Here
optimality depends on one criterion. You have to use the matrissor minimum number of times. Say you
have 4 matrices available - M1(10 1), M2(1 10), M3(10 1) and M4(1 10). Now if you use a 100
capacity matrissor, then you can multiply M2, M3 and M4 in one step and in last step you can multiply
M1, (M2, M3, M4). This can be expressed as (M1, (M2, M3, M4)), where (M2, M3, M4) denotes the
resultant matrix after multiplying M2, M3, M4.

## Input

```
The input file contains the number of test cases T first, which is at most 30. Each test case begins
with a positive integer N(2  N  50) which is the number of matrices. Following N lines contain
the dimensions of matrices, one line per matrix. Dimensions will be valid and any dimension will be in
between 1 to 50. Next line will contain another integer Q(1  Q  N) which is the number of queries,
followed by the capacities of the matrissor in one line. Each test case will be followed by a blank line.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input, print a line Matrix #D in first line, where D is the test case number starting
from 1. In next Q lines print the minimum number of steps to multiply all the matrices. If it is not
possible to multiply the matrices, then print Impossible.. Put a blank line after each output set. See
sample output for details.
