title: Uva 10479  The Hendrie Sequence
---


## Input

```text
The Hendrie Sequence H is a self-describing sequence defined as follows:

 H(1) = 0

 If we expand every number x in H to a subsequence containing x 0s followed by the number x+1,
the resulting sequence is still H (without its first element).

Thus, the first few elements of H are:

0,1,0,2,1,0,0,3,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,3,0,...

You must write a program that, given n, calculates the nth element of H.
```

## Output

```text
Each test case consists of a single line containing the integer n (0 < n < 263) . Input is terminated with
a line containing the number 0 which of course should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the nth element of H on a single line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
