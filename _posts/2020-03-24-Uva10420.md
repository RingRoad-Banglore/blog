title: Uva 10420  List of Conquests

## Input

```text
In Act I, Leporello is telling Donna Elvira about his masters long list of conquests:

This is the list of the beauties my master has loved, a list Ive made out myself: take
a look, read it with me. In Italy six hundred and forty, in Germany two hundred and
thirty-one, a hundred in France, ninety-one in Turkey; but in Spain already a thousand and
three! Among them are country girls, waiting-maids, city beauties; there are countesses,
baronesses, marchionesses, princesses: women of every rank, of every size, of every age.
(Madamina, il catalogo questo)

As Leporello records all the beauties Don Giovanni loved in chronological order, it is very
troublesome for him to present his masters conquest to others because he needs to count the number
of beauties by their nationality each time. You are to help Leporello to count.
