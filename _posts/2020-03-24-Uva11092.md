```
Alice and Bob reside in Independent Impeccable United
Countries (IIUC) a land of the free. There, all the houses
are placed in a hexagonal grid. The kings palace is num-
bered 0 and all others are numbered 1, 2, 3 . . . spirally keep-
ing the kings palace at the center. There is a single street,
starting at kings palace and built like a spiral, touching
the houses 1, 2, 3 . . . sequentially. The picture on the right
shows the first few houses and the street in heavy dark line.

Alice lives in house A and Bob lived in house B. When
Alice wants to visit Bob, since she is afraid of the dark, she
sticks to the road. When Bob wants to visit Alice, he walks
straight to Alices home.
