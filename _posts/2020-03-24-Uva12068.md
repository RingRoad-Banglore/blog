title: Uva 12068  Harmonic Mean
---


```
The harmonic mean (HN ) of N numbers a1, a2, a3 . . . aN1, aN is
defined as below:

HN =
N

1
a1

+ 1
a2

+ 1
a3

+ . . .+ 1
aN1

+ 1
aN

So the harmonic mean of four numbers a, b, c, d is defined as

H4 =
4

1
a
+ 1

b
+ 1

c
+ 1

d

In this problem your job is very simple: given N (0 < N < 9)
integers you will have to find their harmonic mean.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer S (0 < S < 501), which indicates how many sets of
inputs are there. Each of the next S lines contains one set of input. The description of each set is given
below:

Each set starts with an integer N (0 < N < 9), which indicates how many numbers are there in
this set. This number is followed by N integers a1, a2, a3 . . . aN1, aN (0 < ai < 101).

```

## Output

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by two
integers m and n separated by a front slash. These two numbers actually indicate that the harmonic
mean of the given four numbers is m

n
. You must ensure that gcd(m,n) = 1 or in other words m and n

must be relative prime. The value of m and n will fit into a 64-bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
4 1 2 3 4
4 2 2 3 1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 48/25
Case 2: 12/7
```
