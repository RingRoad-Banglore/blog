title: Uva 10735  Euler Circuit
---


## Input

```
An Euler circuit is a graph traversal starting and ending at the same vertex and using every edge
exactly once. Finding an Euler circuit in an undirected or directed graph is a fairly easy task, but what
about graphs where some of the edges are directed and some undirected? An undirected edge can only
be traveled in one direction. However, sometimes any choice of direction for the undirected edges may
not yield an Euler circuit.

Given such a graph, determine whether an Euler circuit exists. If so, output such a circuit in the
format specified below. You can assume that the underlying undirected graph is connected.
```

## Output

```
The first line in the input contains the number of test cases, at most 20. Each test case starts with a
line containing two numbers, V and E the number of vertices (1  V  100) and edges (1  E  500)
in the graph. The vertices are numbered from 1 to V . Then follows E lines specifying the edges. Each
such line will be in the format a b type where a and b are two integers specifying the endpoints of the
edge. type will either be the character U, if the edge is undirected, or D, if the edge is directed. In
the latter case, the edge starts at a and ends at b.

```

## Sample Input

```
If an Euler circuit exist, output an order in which the vertices can be traversed on a single line. The
vertex numbers should be delimited with a single space, and the start and end vertex should be included
both at the beginning and the end of the sequence. Since most graphs have multiple solutions, any
valid solution will be accepted. If no solution exist, output the line No euler circuit exist. Output
a blank line between each test case.
