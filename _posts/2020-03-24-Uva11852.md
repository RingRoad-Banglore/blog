by one square horizontally and two squares vertically.

infinite chess board would end up at one of the follow-
ing eight locations: (1,2), (-1,2), (1,-2), (-1,-2), (2,1),
(-2,1), (2,-1), (-2,-1).

Starting from location (0, 0), what is the minimum
number of moves required for a knight to get to some
other arbitrary location (x, y)?
