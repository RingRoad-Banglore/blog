title: Uva 12281  Hyper-Box
---


## Input

```text
You live in the universe X where all the physical
laws and constants are different from ours. For
example all of their objects are N -dimensional.
The living beings of the universe X want to
build an N -dimensional monument. We can
consider this N dimensional monument as an
N -dimensional hyper-box, which can be di-
vided into some N dimensional hypercells. The
length of each of the sides of a hyper-cell is one.
They will use some N -dimensional bricks (or
hyper-bricks) to build this monument. But the
length of each of the N sides of a brick cannot
be anything other than fibonacci numbers. A
fibonacci sequence is given below:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . .

As you can see each value starting from 3 is the sum of previous 2 values. So for N = 3 they can
use bricks of sizes (2,5,3), (5,2,2) etc. but they cannot use bricks of size (1,2,4) because the length 4
is not a fibonacci number. Now given the length of each of the dimension of the monument determine
the minimum number of hyper-bricks required to build the monument. No two hyper-bricks should
intersect with each other or should not go out of the hyper-box region of the monument. Also none of
the hyper-cells of the monument should be empty.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input file is an integer T (1  T  100) which denotes the number of test cases. Each
test case starts with a line containing N (1  N  15) that denotes the dimension of the monument
and the bricks. Next line contains N integers the length in each dimension. Each of these integers will
be between 1 and 2000000000 inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output contains a line in the format Case x: M where x is the case number (starting
from 1) and M is the minimum number of hyper-bricks required to build the monument.

```

## Sample Output
