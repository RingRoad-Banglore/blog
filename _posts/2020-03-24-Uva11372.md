title: Uva 11372  Arranging a Contest

```
Today is 29 November, 2007.

A month later, we will have our traditional Contest of
Newbies 2007, so it is time for the Newbie Problemset-
ters (NPS) to come up with the programming tasks. This
year, due to heavy schoolwork, NPS fail to write six brand-
new tasks for the contest. Luckily, they have a question
bank with many good programming tasks. NPS just have
to pick six of the tasks out from there. The question is:
which six?

A newbies contest should be easy enough so that even
a beginner is able to solve a couple of tasks for rewarding sake. At the same time, there should be
some harder ones to satisfy the needs of other more experienced contestants. To make the contest more
interesting, the tasks should be of various types.

For each problem in the question bank, NPS have assigned a difficulty level and a favour in-
dex. The problems are of course on different topics, including dynamic programming (DP), simple
mathematics, graph theory etc. NPS would like to choose the tasks such that:

 There are exactly 2 easy tasks and exactly 2 hard ones; and

 There are at least 2 DP tasks, at least 1 graph problem, and at least 1 about maths; and

 The total favour indices is then to be maximized.

Can you write a program to help them?
```

## Input

```
The input file consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains an integer N (6  N 
200), the number of tasks in the question bank. Then there are N lines, each corresponding to one task
in the question bank. See figure below:

The input file is terminated by a line with only the number 0.

## Output

```
For each case, if it is not possible to satisfy the requirements, print No solution. (without the
quotes). Otherwise, print the IDs of the six problems that NPS should choose. If there are more than
one solutions, print the lexicographically smallest one (i.e. treat the output line as a string and consider
its ASCII value).
