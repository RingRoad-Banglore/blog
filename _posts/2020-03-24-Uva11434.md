title: Uva 11434  The Careless Postman Problem
---


```
Once upon a time, there was a postman in china, who walked all through the city to deliver letters. He
wanted to cover this path in shortest time, and thus created the famous Chinese Postman Problem.

Now, after quite a long time, a similar problem arose to a postman. Like the Chinese postman, he
also delivers letters walking through the roads. But due to his careless nature, he often delivers them
really late, and if you are too unlucky, he might lose the letters as well. So, people are really angry at
him. Since, our postman knows about that, he has no intention of facing them. So, he started delivering
them, in disguise. But that also has problems too. People may be deceived by his disguise for 1 or 2
times, but they will recognize him, if they meet him over and over. For each road ei, he may traverse
the road at most pi times. On the other hand, he doesnt like to stay on the same road for long time.
So, each time he traverses, he only delivers one letter. So, if he need to deliver qi letters along a path,
he has to traverse it at least qi times.

Now, given the road network, number of letters to deliver along each road and maximum number
of time, a road can be traversed, find the shortest time the postman needs to deliver all the letters. All
roads are unidirectional.
```

## Input

```
First line of input contains an integer T , the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two
integers, n and m, the number of vertices and number of edges. The following m lines each contain
5 integers, ui, vi, ti, qi and pi, which denotes an edge from ui to vi, which required ti time for the
postman to travel. qi is the number of letters to deliver along the path, and pi is the maximum number
of times the road can be traversed. The postman can start from any vertex, but has to return to that
vertex, after delivering all the letters. You can assume that (a) The graph is connected and (b) Every
vertex has at least one road leading out of it with a required delivery.

Constraints:
T  100
1  N  100,M  N  (N  1)/2
1  ui, vi  N , no edge is given twice
0  ti, pi, qi  100

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number followed by the minimum time the postman requires to deliver
all the letters. If it is not possible to deliver all the letters, print Impossible (without quotes).
