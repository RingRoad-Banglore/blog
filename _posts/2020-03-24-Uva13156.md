title: Uva 13156  In the Kingdom of Hirak

## Input

```text
Once upon a time, there was a king named Hirak Raj. He was so cruel and greedy that farmers
in his kingdom had to pay taxes even when they were starving. Diamonds were accumulated in his
treasury, but the workers in the mine were not paid properly. Those who tried to protest were taken
to Jantar-mantar Ghar, the chamber for brainwashing people. The king divided his kingdom into
R regions. People in one region could communicate by sending letters to any other person within the
same region but no letter could be sent from one region to another.

A reputed teacher named Udayan Pandit was preparing to revolt against the king by educating
his disciples in all the regions of the kingdom. Most of his disciples wrote encrypted letters to each
other to fix the time and place of their meetings. Any disciple would always forward any letter (s/he
wrote or received from others) to other disciples s/he knew in the same region. Udayan Pandit called
a collection of his disciples a group if a letter written by any member of that group would eventually
reach all other members of the group. Moreover, a group always contained the maximal number of
disciples, i.e. no more disciple could be added to a group without violating the property stated above.
Hirak Raj knew all the information about who was communicating with whom, but his police could
not decipher the encrypted letters and distinguish the secret letters from other normal letters.

Soon Hirak Raj became very desperate to find all the miscreants in the kingdom who want to
dethrone him. He ordered every citizen to be taken to an updated version of Jantar-mantar Ghar,
where a device was installed to determine whether a citizen had any intention to revolt or not. All
the citizens classified as miscreants were arrested immediately. But the king was not satisfied with the
efficiency of the machine. So he made another rule: any citizen who was not yet taken to jail would be
arrested if at least K members of his/her group were already classified as miscreants by the device.

Udayan Pandit noticed that the device in Jantar-mantar Ghar is faulty. It classified any person
as a miscreant with probability p without depending on any information of that person. So, he wanted
to know the expected number of arrested disciples in every region of the kingdom.

## Output

```text
The first line of input file contains a single integer, T (1  T  10). Then T test cases follow. Each
case starts with a line containing two integers, R (1  R  20) and K (1  K  2000) and two more
integers a and b (0 < a < b  1000), where a/b = p, the probability of classifying a disciple as a
miscreant. Then there will be descriptions of the communications in those R regions.

Each description starts with a line containing two integers, n (2  n  50000), number of Udayan
Pandits disciples in the region and m (1  m  100000), the number of communications between two
disciples. Then m lines follow. Each of these m lines contains two integers u and v (1  u, v  n and
u = v), indicating disciple u forwards any letter (s/he wrote or received from others) to disciple v.

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output Case x: in a separate line, where x denotes the case number. Then there will
be R lines of output for each case. For each of these R lines, output Region y: z, where y is the
region number (starting from 1 to R) and z is the expected number of disciples arrested.

Suppose, z = u/v in the reduced form. Print u  (v1) mod 1000000007(109 + 7), where v1
is the inverse of v mod 1000000007. You may assume that there will be unique modular
inverse v1 mod 1000000007.

Explanation of Region 1 in the 1st test case: There are only two disciples in the region and they
form a group. Let x be the random variable which denotes the number of disciples arrested.

So, E[x] = 1  Pr(x = 1) + 2  Pr(x = 2).
Now, Pr(x = 1) = Pr(1 was classified as miscreant by the device and 2 was not) + Pr(2 was

classified as miscreant by the device and 1 was not) = 0.5  0.5 + 0.5  0.5 = 0.5.
For the remaining part, Pr(x = 2) = Pr(Both 1 and 2 were classified as miscreants by the device)

+ Pr(Either 1 or 2 was classified as miscreant by the device and the other one was arrested later)
= 0.5  0.5 + 0 = 0.25.

So, E[x] = 1  0.5 + 2  0.25 = 1, which is the expected number of arrested disciples.
