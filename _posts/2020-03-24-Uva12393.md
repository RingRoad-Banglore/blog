title: Uva 12393  Nonnegative Partial Sums
---


```
You are given a sequence of n numbers a0, , an1. A cyclic shift by k positions (0  k  n  1)
results in the following sequence: ak, ak+1, . . . , an1, a0, a1, . . . , ak1. How many of the n cyclic shifts
satisfy the condition that the sum of the first i numbers is greater than or equal to zero for all i with
1  i  n?
```

## Input

```
Each test case consists of two lines. The first contains the number n (1  n  106), the number of
integers in the sequence. The second contains n integers a0, , an1 (1000  ai  1000) representing
the sequence of numbers. The input will finish with a line containing 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print one line with the number of cyclic shifts of the given sequence which satisfy
the condition stated above.
