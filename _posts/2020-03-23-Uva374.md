374 Big Mod
Calculate

R := BP mod M

for large values of B, P , and M using an efficient algorithm. (That’s right, this problem has a time
dependency !!!.)

## Input
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive test cases are
separated by a single blank line.

Three integer values (in the order B, P , M) will be read one number per line. B and P are integers
in the range 0 to 2147483647 inclusive. M is an integer in the range 1 to 46340 inclusive.

## Output
For each test, the result of the computation. A single integer on a line by itself.
