```

Rikka is a high school girl suffering seriously from Chunibyo (the age of fourteen would either act like
a know-it-all adult, or thinks they have special powers no one else has. You might google it for detailed
explanation) who, unfortunately, performs badly at math courses. After scoring so poorly on her maths
test, she is faced with the situation that her club would be disband if her scores keeps low.

Believe it or not, in the next exam she faces a hard problem described as follows.

Lets denote f(x) number of ordered pairs satisfying (a  b)|x (that is, x mod (a  b) = 0)
where a and b are positive integers. Given a positive integer n, Rikka is required to solve
for f(1) + f(2) + . . .+ f(n).

According to story development we know that Rikka scores slightly higher than average, meaning
she must have solved this problem.

So, how does she manage to do so?
```
