## Input

```text
You have a square maze of size N N . You begin from a source cell and start your journey in hope of
reaching the target cell in minimum number of moves. You can move to new cell if it shares an edge with
the current cell you are standing on. The minimum moves required arent always the Manhattan distance
as there are few obstacles placed on certain places of the maze. You have to avoid those obstacles in
your path. In addition to the obstacles, there are more impediments in the form of guards. The guards,
however, arent that clever and they are also short-sighted. Initially every guard monotonously walks
to the right. If it encounters an obstacle or reaches the end of the maze (last column) it turns left
and starts walking. It walks left until it reaches an obstacle or the end (first column) when it changes
direction to the right and starts walking. Every guard moves 1 cell per unit time. Your speed is also 1
cell per unit time. In every unit time, you can either make a move or stay in the same position. Staying
in the same position also counts as a move.

You are caught by a guard if both of you land on the same cell at the same time or if you bump
into each other during a move. In the latter case, you are caught in between the cells.

Every cell of the maze will be represented by one of the following:

S - Starting Cell.
T - Target Cell.
# - An Obstacle
X - A Guard
. - An Empty Cell

There will be at most 3 guards in a maze and all of them will be situated in different rows.
An example of the movement of a guard for first 6 seconds of its locomotion:

```

## Output

```text
The input file starts with an integer T (T < 50) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
starts with a positive integer N (N < 10). The next N lines contain N characters each that fill up the
maze. There will be exactly one S character and one T character. There will be no more than 3 X
characters in the maze.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input, output the case number followed by the minimum number of moves required. If it is
impossible to reach the target, output -1 instead.
