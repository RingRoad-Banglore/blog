## Input

```

Imagine you are in a well planned city in which a very large area has all streets or avenues set nicely in a
perpendicular way resembling a grid. For a real example consider Downtown Manhattan in New York.
Obviously, there may be cases in which a street or avenue is suddenly discontinued. For you, streets or
avenues are the same and to simplify we call them roads. You can always walk in any direction along
a road (either North/South or East/West).

We have a small challenge for you. As illustrated in the figure, we want you to determine in how
many ways can you go from a start position A to an end position B. By position we mean a crossing
between two roads. There is a small catch, you are not allowed to travel South or West.

Given a grid of N N roads, a starting position A = (Ax, Ay) and a ending position B = (Bx, By),
your task is to count in how many ways can you go from A to B without ever travelling South or
West. You can assume that there will always be at least one valid path between the start and the end
positions.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains C (0 < C < 1000), the number of test cases that follows.

Each test case starts with a line containing the number N (1 < N  30) of vertical and horizontal
roads, followed by two lines containing the start position and the end position. Each position is defined
by two integer coordinates separated by a single space.

The next line contains the number of places, W (limited by the size of the grid), where the roads
are discontinued. The following W lines, describe such places. Each place is defined by two integer
coordinates Px and Py (road numbers between 1 and N) followed by a symbol D (D in {N,E, S,W})
indicating that there are men working in the direction D with respect to junction (Px, Py). The three
values that characterize a place are separated by a single space.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input case your program must output a line indicating the number of ways you can go from
the start to the end point, given that you are not allowed to travel South or West.

Note: The first test case illustrates the figure.
