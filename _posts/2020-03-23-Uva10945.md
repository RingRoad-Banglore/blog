10945 Mother Bear
Unforunately for our lazy “heroes”, the nuts were
planted by an evil bear known as.. Dave, and they’ve
fallen right into his trap. Dave is not just any bear,
he’s a talking bear, but he can only understand sen-
tences that are palindromes. While Larry was dazed
and confused, Ryan figured this out, but need a way
to make sure his sentences are palindromic. So he
pulled out his trustly iPod, which thankfully have
this program you wrote just for this purpose... or did
you?

## Input
You’ll be given many sentences. You have to deter-
mine if they are palindromes or not, ignoring case and punctuations. Every sentence will only contain
the letters A-Z, a-z, ‘.’, ‘,’, ‘!’, ‘?’. The end of input will be a line containing the word ‘DONE’, which
should not be processed.

## Output
On each input, output ‘You won't be eaten!’ if it is a palindrome, and ‘Uh oh..’ if it is not a
palindrome.

## Sample Input
<p>Madam, Im adam!</p><p>Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor.</p><p>Me so hungry!</p><p>Si nummi immunis</p><p>DONE</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>You won't be eaten!</p><p>You won't be eaten!</p><p>Uh oh..</p><p>You won't be eaten!</p>
