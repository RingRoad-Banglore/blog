title: Uva 01651  Binary Operation
---


## Input

```text

Consider a binary operation  defined on digits 0 to 9,

:{0, 1, . . . , 9}  {0, 1, . . . , 9}  {0, 1, . . . , 9}

such that 0 0 = 0.
A binary operation  is a generalization of  to the set of non-negative integers,

:ZZ0+  ZZ0+  ZZ0+
The result of a  b is defined in the following way: if one of the numbers a and b has fewer digits

than the other in decimal notation, then append leading zeroes to it, so that the numbers are of the
same length; then apply the operation digit-wise to the corresponding digits of a and b.

Example. If a b = ab mod 10, then 5566 239 = 84.

Let us define  to be left-associative, that is, a b c is to be interpreted as (a b) c.
Given a binary operation  and two non-negative integers a and b, calculate the value of

a (a+ 1) (a+ 2) . . . (b 1) b
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first ten lines of the input file contain the description of the binary operation . The i-th line

of the input file contains a space-separated list of ten digits  the j-th digit in this list is equal to
(i 1) (j  1).

The first digit in the first line is always 0.
The eleventh line of the input file contains two non-negative integers a and b (0  a  b  1018).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output on a line by itself a single number  the value of a  (a + 1)  (a + 2) 
. . . (b 1) b without extra leading zeroes.

```

## Sample Output

```text
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2

4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3

5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4

6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
