title: Uva 11904  One Unit Machine
---


```
OUM is a one unit machine which processes jobs. Since it cant handle heavyweight jobs; jobs needs to
be partitioned into units. Initially, all the job information and unit partitions are given as input. Then
the machine allocates necessary time slots. And in each time slot it asks the user for the name of the
job to be processed. After getting the name; the machine determines the next unprocessed unit of that
job and processes that unit in that slot. If there is no such unit, the machine crashes. A job is said to
be complete if all the units of that job are complete.

For example, let J1 and J2 be two jobs each having 2 units. So, OUM will create 4 time slots. Now
the user can give J1 J2 J2 J1 as input. That means it completes the 1-st unit of J1 in time slot 1 and
then completes the 1-st unit of J2 in time slot 2. After that it completes the 2-nd unit of J2 and 2-nd
unit of J1 in time slots 3 and 4 respectively. But if the user gives J1 J1 J2 J1 as input, the machine
crashes in time slot 4 since it tries to process 3-rd unit of J1 which is not available.

Now, Sam is the owner of a software firm named ACM and he has n jobs to complete using OUM.
He wants to complete Jobi before Jobi+1 where 1  i < n. Now he wants to know the total number of
ways he can complete these jobs without crashing the OUM. He assigned you for this task. Two ways
are different if at t-th slot one processed a unit of Jobi and another processed a unit of Jobj where
i = j. For the example above, there are three ways:

J1 J1 J2 J2
J1 J2 J1 J2
J2 J1 J1 J2
```

## Input

```
The first line of input will contain T ( 100) denoting the number of cases.

Each case starts with an integer n (1  n  1000). The next line contains n space separated positive
integers k1, k2, k3, , kn. Where, ki denotes the number of units for the i-th job. You can assume that
total number of units for all the jobs in any case is not greater than 106.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the case number and the result modulo 1000,000,007.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
2
2 2
3
2 2 3

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 45
```
