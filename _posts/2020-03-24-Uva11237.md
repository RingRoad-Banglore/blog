title: Uva 11237  Halloween treats
---


## Input

```
Every year there is the same problem at Halloween: Each neighbour is only willing to give a certain total
number of sweets on that day, no matter how many children call on him, so it may happen that a child
will get nothing if it is too late. To avoid conflicts, the children have decided they will put all sweets
together and then divide them evenly among themselves. From last years experience of Halloween they
know how many sweets they get from each neighbour. Since they care more about justice than about
the number of sweets they get, they want to select a subset of the neighbours to visit, so that in sharing
every child receives the same number of sweets. They will not be satisfied if they have any sweets left
which cannot be divided.

Your job is to help the children and present a solution.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers c and n (1  c  n  100000), the number of
children and the number of neighbours, respectively. The next line contains n space separated integers
a1, . . . , an (1  ai  100000), where ai represents the number of sweets the children get if they visit
neighbour i.

The last test case is followed by two zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output one line with the indices of the neighbours the children should select (here,
index i corresponds to neighbour i who gives a total number of ai sweets). If there is no solution where
each child gets at least one sweet, print no sweets instead. Note that if there are several solutions
where each child gets at least one sweet, you may print any of them.

```

## Sample Output
