title: Uva 12373  Pair of Touching Circle
---


## Input

```text
Given a rectangular grid of height H and width W . A problem setter wants to draw a pair of circles
inside the rectangle so that they touch each other but do not share common area and both the circles
are completely inside the rectangle. As the problem setter does not like precision he also wants their
centers on integer coordinates and their radii to be positive integers as well. How many different ways
can he draw such pair of circles? Two drawings are different from each other if any of the circles has
different center location or radius.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains the number of test cases T (T  500). Each of the next T lines will
contain two integers H and W (0 < H,W  1000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input output the case number and the number of ways of drawing such pairs of circles
maintaining the mentioned constraints. See sample output for exact formatting. The output will fit
into 64-bit signed integer.
