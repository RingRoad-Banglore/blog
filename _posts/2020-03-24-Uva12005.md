## Input

```text
Look at the following equation:

c = ab
a+ b

2
+ 1

Now given the value of c, how many possible values of and a and b are there (a and b must be
positive integers)? That is you will have to find the number of pairs (a, b) which satisfies the above
equation.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains around 3000 line of input. Each line contains an integers n (0 < n  1014).
This n actually denotes the value of c. A line containing a single zero terminates the input. This line
should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains two integers. First integer denotes
the value of c and the second integer denotes the number of pair of values of a and b that satisfies the
above equation, given the value of c.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1020
400
0

```
