title: Uva 11749  Poor Trade Advisor
---


## Input

```text
Yesterday, you were working on a strange
machine found in an old garage (later,
you find out it was Dr. Emmett Browns
garage), when you accidentally pushed
a button and were sent back in time to
48 BC with only a laptop in your hand!
Fortunately, you knew enough Latin to
communicate with one of the locals who
turned out to be Caesars trade advisor.
The advisor invited you to his house and
gave you food. In return, you asked him
how you could help him. He answered
that recently, Caesar has decided to es-
tablish a new province in a high profit
region of his empire. The empire is a net-
work of cities connected by bidirectional
roads, and each road has a certain profit
per annum (PPA) value. The PPA of any given road is calculated by subtracting its annual upkeep
cost from its annual revenue.

The new province will consist of a connected, non-empty set of roads (and the corresponding cities).
The province must also have the highest possible average PPA. Caesar further asked his trade advisor
to determine the maximum possible number of cities in such a province. Now, the advisor needs your
help to solve this problem, or he is worried that Caesar will put him to the sword. You decide to write
a program to solve this problem, but you should remember that your laptop has a limited remaining
battery and you must be fast!
```

## Output

```text
Each test case starts with two integers 1 < n  500 and 1  m  1, 000, 000, the numbers of cities and
roads in the empire respectively. The next m lines each contain three integers where the first two are
distinct, between 1 and n, and represent the endpoints of a road, while the third integer is the PPA of
that road (fits in a signed 32 bit variable). Input is terminated with a line consisting of n = m = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
There is one line of output for each test case consisting of a single integer that is the maximum number
of cities in a highest average PPA province.
