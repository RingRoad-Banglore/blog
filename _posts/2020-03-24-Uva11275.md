title: Uva 11275  3D Triangles
---


## Input

```
Given the vertices of two triangles in 3D Coordinates, check whether both of them have any common
point. All points on the edges or vertices are considered to be part of the a triangle. Two points are
considered to be the same point if their Euclidean distance is less or equal to 0.000001.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer t (t  100000) denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case
contains 18 floating point numbers with at most 7 digits after the decimal. They are the vertices of the
triangles as (x, y, z) first three triples are for one triangle and the rest of them are for the other one.
None of the triangles will be invalid.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input value, output 1 on a single line if the triangles share a common point. Otherwise,
output 0.
