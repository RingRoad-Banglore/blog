## Input

```
Write a program, that given the fixtures of a football championship, outputs the corresponding classi-
fication following the format specified below. Win, draw and loss earn respectively three, one and zero
points.

The criteria of classification are the number of points scored, followed by goal difference (goals
scored minus goals suffered), and then scored goals. When more than one team have exactly the same
number of points, goal difference, and scored goals, these are considered as having the same position in
the classification.
```

## Output

```
The input will consist of a series of tests. Each test starts with a line containing two positive integers
28  T  1 and G  0. T is the number of teams and G is the number of games played. Follow then
T lines, each containing the name of a squad. Squad names have up to 15 characters, and may only
contain letters and dash characters (-). Finally the following G lines contain the score of each game.
The scores are output with the following format: name of home team, number of goals scored by home
team, a dash, number of goals scored by away team, and name of away team.

The input ends with a test case where T = G = 0 and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input
