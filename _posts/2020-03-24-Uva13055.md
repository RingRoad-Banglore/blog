## Input

```
Dom Cobb and his partner Arthur perform illegal stuffs by entering the subconscious minds of their
targets. They use two-level dream within a dream strategy to extract valuable information. Dreamers
are awakened either by a sudden shock (a kick), or they may die in the dream.

Now Dom wants your help. Because he has a complex assignment. He has to go through a lot of
peoples dreams. He travels from one persons dream to another persons dream. He is too consumed
that he can no longer keep track whether he is awake or in someone elses dream.

He will give you n queries to process, each of the queries will be in one of the following forms:

Sleep X  This means person named X will be sleeping and Dom is going into Xs dream, from
the previous persons dream (if any).

Kick  This means the current person in whose dream Dom has entered, will be awaken, and Dom
will return to the previous persons dream from where he came to this dream. If Dom is not in
anyones dream anymore, ignore this query.

Test  This means Dom wants to know whose dream he is in at the moment. You have to print
the persons name. If Dom is not in anyones dream at the moment, you have to print Not in a
dream (without the quotes).
```

## Output

```

a string composed of only uppercase or lowercase letters and no more than 15 characters long.
