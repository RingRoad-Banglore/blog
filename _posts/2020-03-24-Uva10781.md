## Input

```text
One day Mahbub lost his way in a forest. He had no GPS receiver. But he had a watch which gives time
in GMT and he knew the date. With the watch he note the time of sunrise and sunset and calculated
his approximate position on the earth.

The word solstice is a corruption of 2 Latin words that mean sun and stand. The days when this
occurs are known as the Summer Solstice and the Winter Solstice. Very basically the Earth revolves
round the Sun, also the Earths axis is tilted relative to the Sun at 23.45. The relative tilt of the Earths
varies to the supposed axis of the Sun as we progress through the year. With the respective movements
of Sun and Earth at these significant times during the year the northern and southern hemispheres are
nearer the Sun, or the Sun is further north or south. In the northern hemisphere, when the Sun is
furthest north at the time of the Summer Solstice the Sun is overhead at latitude 23.45 north, also
known as the Tropic of Cancer. Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes are in fact the point when the Sun
passes over the Equator.

For calculation Mahbub assumes the following:

 The earth is a perfect spare of radius 6378 km.

 The earth rounds the sun in a perfect circular path in 365 days (neglect leap years) with a constant
speed.

 The earth rounds around its own axis in 24 hours.

 Earths axis is tilted relative to the Sun at 23.45.

 21st June 12 pm GMT is the Summer Solstice.

  = 2  arccos(0)

NB: There are days at north and south pole, at which the sun shines the whole day, or it doesnt shine
at all. There will be be no such input.

## Output

```text
Input is consist of several test cases. Each test case contains date (dd/mm) and time (hh:mm:ss) of
sunrise in GMT, time (hh:mm:ss) of sunset in GMT. Input will be terminated by end of file.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print the latitude and the longitude (ddd:mm:ss NSEW). Error of at most 1 minute
is acceptable. When it is impossible to calculate either latitude or longitude print the line Lost My
Way. Each test case should be separated by new line.

```
