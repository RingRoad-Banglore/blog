title: Uva 12937  Internet of Lights and Switches
---


## Input

```
You are a fan of Internet of Things(IoT), so you build a nice Internet of Lights and Switches in your
huge mansion. Formally, there are n lights and m switches, each switch controls one or more lights, i.e.
pressing that switch flips the status of those lights (on  off, off  on).

Initially, all the lights are on. Your task is to count the number of ways to turn off all the lights by
pressing some consecutive switches. There is only one restriction: the number of switches you pressed
should be between a and b (inclusive).
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing four integers n, m, a,
b (2  n  50, 1  a  b  m  300000). Each of the following m lines contains a 01 string of length
n. The i-th character is 1 if and only if that switch controls the i-th light. The size of the whole input
file does not exceed 8MB.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number, and the number of ways to turn off all the lights.
