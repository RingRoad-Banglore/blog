## Input

```text
On Killer Sudoku Online,

(http://www.killersudokuonline.com/)
there is a very interesting Sudoku variant 
Greater Than Sudoku.

The right figure shows a Greater Than Su-
doku puzzle. As you can see, there is abso-
lutely no number to start with! There are
only greater-than signs (>) between the cells.
Beside usual Sudoku rules, there is an extra
one: all greater-than signs must be satisfied, i.e.
each of them must point from a larger number
to a smaller one.

If there is no number given, then where shall
we begin? Look at the partial puzzle shown in
the left. Note that the centre cell (coloured in
blue) is the only cell in its big square with all
its greater-than signs pointing inwards. There-
fore, it must contain the smallest number, i.e.
1 (one). Together with the usual Sudoku skills
and some new tricks, we can solve the puzzle
completely.

This sample puzzle is discussed in great detail in ReallyEvilCanines blog
(A Day in the Life: Solving Greater Than Sudoku Puzzles

Write a program that solves Greater Than Sudoku puzzles. In short,
for each puzzle, we need to complete the grid so that each row, column and
3 3 box contains every digit from 1 to 9 (inclusive), and each greater-than
sign points from a larger digit to a smaller one.
