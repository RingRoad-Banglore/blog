## Input

```text
The Dummywood film industry is infamous for its repetitive sto-
ries. The phrase, if you have seen one, you have seen them all
perfectly applies to it. The movies are made by fitting together
existing set of scenes. This reduces production time, as there is
hardly ever a new stunt to perform, nor the writers need to be cre-
ative in bringing out something innovative. To make the movies
lengthy, the producers opt to repeat monotonous events, such as
repetitive breaking of glass doors or the bad guys rolling over
the floor. Cutpiece is a producer who wants to use the power of
computers to gain advantage in this film industry. He has a set
of scenes out of which he wants to make his next movie. He plans
to merge these scenes to make one complete movie. Although,
mere merging of the scenes in some order would make a movie,
but Cutpiece wants to minimize the length of the movie. The
minimizing technique that he plans to apply relies on the fact
that, scenes are so repetitive in their components that, the beginning of one and ending of another
may be identical up to a certain length. Cutpiece has decided to condense these scenes so that the
repetitive portions are included once in the merging process. In this problem, given a set of scenes,
you will have to determine the minimum length of the movie that can be made by merging the given
scenes in a particular order, condensing the repetitive portions during the merging process. Look at
the explanation for sample input/output below to further clarify the condensing process.

## Output

```text
The first line of input will consist of a positive integer T  50, where T denotes the number of test cases.
Each case starts with a positive integer n  6 where n denotes the number of scenes that Cutpiece will
merge. The following n lines will each contain a string of length at most 10. The strings will consist of
upper case letters only and will have at least one character. Each of these strings represents one scene
and the individual letters correspond to components forming a scene.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case of input, there will be one line of output. It will consist of the case number followed
by the minimum length of movie that can be made. Look at the output for sample input for exact
formatting.

Explanation of Sample Input/Output:
Case 1 -> if we order the input strings as ABCD CDEF and DEFGH. Merge the first 2 to get

ABCDEF. Here we condense (CD) into a single occurrence since this is the longest length common suffix
of one and prefix of another. Next we merge ABCDEF with DEFGH to obtain ABCDEFGH, giving us a string
of length 8. Any other ordering of the three strings will not yield a shorter final string. Note that,
when merging, we always merge from left to right after ordering the string. Therefore, for the above
ordering, we would not merge CDEF and DEFGH first.

Case 2 -> Here one string is a subset of another and we can entirely condense the components of
shorter string to give us a string of length 7.
