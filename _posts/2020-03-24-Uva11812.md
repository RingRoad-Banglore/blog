## Input

```
Its FIFA World Cup 2010. The whole world is waiting for the greatest event on the planet. Since huge
number of people will come to South Africa for the world cup; its quite tough for them to maintain the
flow of the people as well as the traffic. Thats why they are planning to forbid vehicles to use some
roads. But if all the roads are forbidden then people would be in trouble.

The World Cup authority has divided South Africa into n junctions and m one way roads. Before
each match, the authority will consider some junctions as interesting junctions, where people will get
together and set out for the stadium in processions. Now each procession will try to use the shortest
path towards the stadium. Thats why the World Cup authority wants to forbid vehicles in the roads
which may be used by the processions.

The idea is as follows. They will first find the shortest path amongst the paths from the interesting
junctions to the stadium. They will block all the roads in the path. If there are multiple shortest paths
from one or multiple interesting junctions to the stadium, they will block all of them. They will send
some vehicles along the paths which will put notice boards to the roads such that no vehicles can go
through. After that they will search for more shortest-paths considering the blocked roads and send
vehicles for the paths (if any). They will continue blocking the roads until no path is found.

Now your task is to solve the problem for them.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a blank line. The next line contains three integers n (2  n  100), m
(0  m  10000), and S (1  S < n). S is the total number of interesting junctions.

The next line will contain S + 1 different integer (each of them lies between 1 and n) separated by
spaces, where the first S integers denote the interesting junctions, and the last one denotes the stadium.

Each of the next m lines will contain 3 integers u v w (1  u, v  n, u = v, 1  w  10000) meaning
that there is a road from u to v, and the length is w. If multiple roads are listed for same junctions in
either direction, you can assume that the roads are different.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case print the case number in a single line. If no path is found then print No road to block.
If a shortest path is found then print the path cost c as The path cost is c. After that report the
roads that are blocked in u v w form (as in input). They should be listed in ascending order based on
u; for same u, based on v. Report all the shortest path costs and the roads in similar format. Check
the samples for more details.
