## Input

```
You just inherited the rights to n previously unreleased songs recorded by the popular group Raucous
Rockers. You plan to release a set of m compact disks with a selection of these songs. Each disk can
hold a maximum of t minutes of music, and a song can not overlap from one disk to another. Since you
are a classical music fan and have no way to judge the artistic merits of these songs, you decide on the
following criteria for making the selection:

1. The songs will be recorded on the set of disks in the order of the dates they were written.

2. The total number of songs included will be maximized.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input indicates the number of datasets, then
there is a blank line and the datasets separated by a blank line.

Each dataset consists of one line containing the values of n, t and m (integer numbers) followed by
a line containing a list of the length of n songs, t1, t2, ..., tn ordered by the date they were written (Each
ti is less than t minutes long and

n
i=1 ti > m t.)

```

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset, the output consists of one integer indicating the number of songs that, following the
above selection criteria will fit on m disks.

Print a blank line between consecutive datasets.
