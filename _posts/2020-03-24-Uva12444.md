## Input

```
Let A and B be non-negative integers and let
C = A&B and D = A|B. Given C and D,
can you find A and B such that the absolute
difference (|A  B|) is minimal? (A&B and
A|B are bitwise AND and OR respectively).
```

## Output

```
The input starts with an integer T  the num-
ber of test cases (T  100). T cases follow on
each subsequent line, each of them containing
integers C and D (0  C,D < 231).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print integers A and B on a
line such that A&B = C, A|B = D, A  B and B A is minimal. If there are no such A and B, print
-1 on the line instead.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
2 3
3 2
3 15

```
