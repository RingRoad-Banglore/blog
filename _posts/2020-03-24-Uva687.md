## Input

```
Once upon a time, there was a king who loved beautiful costumes very much. The king had a special
cocoon bed to make excellent cloth of silk. The cocoon bed had 16 small square rooms, forming a 44
lattice, for 16 silkworms. The cocoon bed can be depicted as follows:

The cocoon bed can be divided into 10 rect-
angular boards, each of which has 5 slits:

Note that, except for the slit depth, there is
no difference between the left side and the right
side of the board (or, between the front and the
back); thus, we cannot distinguish a symmetric
board from its rotated image as is shown in the
following:

Slits have two kinds of depth, either shallow
or deep. The cocoon bed should be constructed
by fitting five of the boards vertically and the
others horizontally, matching a shallow slit with
a deep slit.

Your job is to write a program that calcu-
lates the number of possible configurations to
make the lattice. You may assume that there is
no pair of identical boards. Notice that we are
interested in the number of essentially differ-
ent configurations and therefore you should not
count mirror image configurations and rotated
configurations separately as different configura-
tions.

The following is an example of mirror im-
age and rotated configurations, showing ver-
tical and horizontal boards seperately, where
shallow and deep slits are denoted by 1 and
0 respectively.

Notice that a rotation may exchange positions of a vertical board and a horizontal board.

## Output

```
The input consists of multiple data sets, each in a line. A data set gives the patterns of slits of 10
boards used to construct the lattice. The format of a data set is as follows:

xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 687  Lattice Practices 3/3

Each x is either 0 or 1. 0 means a deep slit, and 1 a shallow slit. A block of five slit
descriptions corresponds to a board. There are 10 blocks of slit descriptions in a line. Two adjacent
blocks are separated by a space.

For example, the first data set in the Sample Input means the set of the following 10 boards:

The end of the input is indicated by a line consisting solely of three characters END.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each data set, the number of possible configurations to make the lattice from the given 10 boards
should be output, each in a separate line.

```

## Sample Output
