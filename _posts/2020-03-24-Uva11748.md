title: Uva 11748  Rigging Elections
---


## Input

```
Elections in your country are performed
in a one-on-one elimination style. Each
week, two people are chosen from a pool
of candidates and the country votes on
which one they prefer. The loser is elim-
inated and the winner is returned to the
pool of candidates. This process contin-
ues until only one candidate remains.

To make a bad voting system even
worse, a single person is charged with the
responsibility of choosing the two candi-
dates each week. This person happens to
be you! Since you are a very selfish per-
son, you plan on rigging the election so
your preferred candidate wins. You have
access to polling data from which you can
determine who would win in every possible head-to-head matchup. Assuming the data accurately rep-
resents what the real outcome would be, is it possible to schedule the candidates so your candidate
wins?
```

## Output

```
The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and c with 1  n  100, 1  m  100
and 1  c  n. Here, n indicates the total number of candidates in the initial pool, m is the number
of voters and c is the number of your preferred candidate. This is followed by m lines, each containing
a permutation of the numbers 1 through n. The i-th line should be interpreted as a ranking of the n
candidates by voter i. If two candidates are pitted against each other in an election, then voter i will
vote for whoever appears first in their list. You may also assume m is always odd. The last line of
input contains three zeros and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
There is a single line of output for each test case with either the message yes or no indicating if it
is possible for you to rig the elections so your preferred candidate c wins.
