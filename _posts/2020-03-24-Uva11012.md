## Input

```text
CABBAGE, n.

A familiar kitchen-garden vegetable about
as large and wise as a mans head.

Ambrose Bierce

Scientists from the planet Zeelich have figured out a way to grow cabbages in space. They have
constructed a huge 3-dimensional steel grid upon which they plant said cabbages. Each cabbage is
attached to a corner in the grid, where 6 steel cables meet and is assigned Cartesian coordinates. A
cosmic ant wants to crawl from cabbage X to cabbage Y along the cables that make the grid. The
cosmic ant always chooses the shortest possible path along the grid lines while going from cabbage X
to cabbage Y. This distance is called the cosmic distance between two cabbages. Given a collection of
cabbages what is the maximum distance between any two of the cabbages?
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (0 < N < 21). N test cases follow. Each one starts
with a line containing n (2  n  105). The next n lines will each give the 3-dimensional coordinates
of a cosmic cabbage (integers in the range [108, 108]).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the largest cosmic distance
between cabbages X and Y, out of all possible choices of X and Y.
