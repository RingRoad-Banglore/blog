title: Uva 01608  Non-boring sequences
---


## Input

```text

We were afraid of making this problem statement too boring, so we decided to keep it short. A sequence
is called non-boring if its every connected subsequence contains a unique element, i.e. an element such
that no other element of that subsequence has the same value.

Given a sequence of integers, decide whether it is non-boring.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T . The descriptions of the test cases follow:
Each test case starts with an integer n (1  n  200000) denoting the length of the sequence. In

the next line the n elements of the sequence follow, separated with single spaces. The elements are
non-negative integers less than 109.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Print the answers to the test cases in the order in which they appear in the input. For each test case
print a single line containing the word non-boring or boring.

```

## Sample Output

```text
