The kingdom of ByteLand is in trouble. The enemies are going to attack ByteLand. The enemies
know that ByteLand has exactly N cities and exactly M bidirectional roads and it is possible to go
from any city to every other city directly or via other cities. They also know that any pair of cities
can be directly connected by at most one road. But they do not have any information about which
road connects which two cities. They are planning to destroy all critical roads of ByteLand. A road is
critical if after destroying that road only at least one pair of cities become disconnected. They are very
optimistic so they expect to destroy maximum number of critical roads. What is the maximum number
of critical roads that can be present in ByteLand according only to the information the enemies have
about ByteLand?
