title: Uva 12557  Detecting Code Snippets
---


```
Have you tried to modify code by changing some names of the identifiers? For example, the following
codes can be changed to each other.

int i, j; int a, i;
i = 3; a = 3;
j = i + 1; i = a + 1;

However, int cannot be changed, because its a keyword, not an identifier. Similarly, operators
like = or + cant be changed, either.

To simplify the I/O, we use one upper-case letter to denote one kind of token that cannot be
changed, and use one lower-case letter to denote an identifier whose name can be changed. However,
two different lower-case letters cannot be changed to the same letter.

For example, if we use the following table:

Token int , ; = 3 + 1
letter A B C D E F G

Then the first program can be written as AiBjCiDECjDiFGC, the second one is AaBiCaDECiDaFGC.
Given a snippet (a small piece of code), can you find all its occurrences (possibly overlapping) in a

large program?
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case contains two lines, the first
line is the program to be searched in, and the second line is the snippet. Both lines will contain letters
only. There will be at most 106 characters in either string. The total input size will be less than 10M
bytes.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the number of occurrences of the snippet in the program.
Explanation:

In the first sample, ccd and dde are both changed version of aab. def is not counted because
a cannot be changed into both d and e. In the second sample, DEabc is not counted because AB
cannot be changed into DE. ABcaa is not counted because b and c cannot be both changed to a.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
ccddef
aab
ABdefDEabcABcaa
ABabc

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 2
Case 2: 1
```
