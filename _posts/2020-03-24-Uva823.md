Figure 1. Two stoppers.

Stephen Steppers Supply Store sells stoppers  rub-
ber corks for sealing jars, bottles, and other contain-
ers that have round openings. A stopper is shaped
like two concentric cylinders, each of height 1.5 cen-
timeters, glued together. Figure 1 shows two stoppers
of different sizes.

When Stephen packages an order to be shipped by
mail, he tries to use space efficiently to conserve pack-
ing material. Since stoppers are the smallest items in
his store, he packs them last, and finds that he must often pack several stoppers into small triangular
gaps at the top of the shipping carton. Stoppers must inserted in one of the two orientations shown
in Figure 1. The triangular spaces are only 3 cm deep, so stoppers cannot be placed on top of one
another; however, the large cylinder of one stopper is permitted to overlap the large cylinder of another
inverted stopper as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Your job is to help Stephen decide what collections of
stoppers will fit into a triangular space.

Figure 2: Three stoppers packed
inside a triangle.

For instance, suppose a triangular space with side lengths 8, 7,
and 10 were available, and we had to fit three stoppers in it with
inside/outside diameters of 2cm/3cm, 1.5cm/3cm, and 1cm/3cm.
One way to pack them is as shown in Figure 2. (The dotted
circle indicates that the smaller cylinder of one of the stoppers
is underneath the larger one.) The only packing Stephen will
consider has the larger cylinder of each stopper touching two sides
of the triangle, with no two larger cylinders touching the same
pair of sides.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of a sequence of triangle specifications and descriptions of three stoppers for each
triangle. Each triangular space is specified by three positive integers representing the lengths of the
three sides; only valid triangles will appear in the input. A pair of positive real numbers represents each
stopper. The first number in the pair represents the diameter of the smaller cylinder, and the second
represents the diameter of the larger cylinder. The final line of the input file contains zeros for all the
data values.

```

## Output

```
For each triangle, print a line identifying its sequence number in the input data and a line indicating
whether or not the stoppers can be packed into the triangular space. Separate the output for each
triangle with a blank line. Do not print anything for the final line of zeros in the input. Imitate the
sample output as closely as possible.
