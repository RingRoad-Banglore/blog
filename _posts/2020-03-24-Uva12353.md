title: Uva 12353  Fence Making

## Input

```
The City of Haka is very famous for its traffic jam. This has
given birth to many problemsetters (Those who pose questions for
programming contests) as in traffic jam some people have nothing
meaningful to do other than thinking about new problems. Most
wide roads in Haka have fence along the divider. Perforated steel
sheets (As shown in the figure on the left) are often used in these
fences.

In this problem we will discuss the manufacturing
process of one kind of perforated steel strips and ask
you to solve a problem related to this building process.

For this problem the rectangular per-
forated steel strips have two circular holes
in each row. Circular holes in the same
row are 2d distance apart. Two consecu-
tive circular holes in the same column are
also 2d distance apart. The distance of
each circle from its nearest side is d. The
radius of all the circles is r. So automat-
ically the width of the metal sheet/strip
becomes (4d+4r). The length of the ini-
tial sheet is S. Such a sheet with holes
in it is shown in the picture on the right.
Holes are only drilled if they can be cut
according to rules mentioned above. The
circular steel sheets which are obtained
by cutting the holes and part of the sheet
that is unused (Such as portion below
the red dotted line in the figure on the
right) are melted to create a new steel
sheet/strip of width (4d+4r). Now holes
are cut according to the rules mentioned
above. This process is repeated until the
newly created sheet is so small that two holes (In the same row) cannot be created in it following the
above-mentioned restrictions. Suppose C(d, r, S) denote the total number of holes that are created.
Now given the minimum possible value of r (rmin), maximum possible value of r (rmax), minimum pos-
sible value of d (dmin) and maximum possible value of d (dmax) you will have to find the total number
of holes created.

In other words you will have to find
rmax

r=rmin

dmax
d=dmin

C(d, r, S).

It should be clear to you now that the value of d and r are always integer. Your method should be
quite efficient. You must assume that the initial given strip and the strips created later on have equal
and uniform thickness in all places.

## Output

```
Input file contains 1000 sets of inputs. The input for each set is given in a single line. Each line contains
five integers rmin (5, 000  rmin  10, 000), rmax (0  rmax  rmin  1, 000) , dmin (1  dmin  21),
dmax (0  dmax  dmin  100) and S (1, 000, 000  S  2, 000, 000, 000). By now it should be clear to
you that value of r and d can only be a round number.

Input is terminated by a line containing five zeroes. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set/line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer, which denotes the
value of

rmax
r=rmin

dmax
d=dmin

C(d, r, S).

You can safely assume that the value of this integer will comfortably fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
Errors not exceeding 107% will be ignored.
