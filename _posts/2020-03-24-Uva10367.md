title: Uva 10367  Equations
---


## Input

```
Given 2 equations on the variables x and y, solve for x and y.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains N , the number of test cases. Each
test case consists of two equations, each on a separate line. An
empty line separates cases. An equation consists of two or more
terms separated by addition, subtraction, or equality operators.
A term is an integer, or a variable name (x or y) optionally pre-
ceded by a minus sign or an integer coefficient.

There is exactly one equality operator. All operators are sur-
rounded by spaces, and there are no spaces within terms.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print two lines, giving the values of x and y as
rationals in simplest terms. If x or y has no unique rational value
such that both equations hold, print don't know for its value.

Print an empty line between cases.

```

## Sample Output

```
7
2x + 3y = x
5 = x + y + 3

2x + 3y = 0
10x = -15y

2x + 3y = 0
10x = -15y + 1

x = 1
3x = 6y

2x = 3x + -x + y
x + y = x + y

2x = -3
-2y = 3

1 = 2
x = 3
