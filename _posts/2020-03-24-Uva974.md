title: Uva 00974  Kaprekar Numbers
---


```

Shri Dattathreya Ramachandra Kaprekar was an Indian mathematician,
whose name is associated with a number of concepts in number theory. He
was born in Dahanu, near Mumbai, in India. Even as a small child, he was
already interested in numbers.

Among his numerous contributions are the so called Kaprekar numbers.
These are non-negative integer numbers such that the representation of their
square can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again.
For example, 55 is a Kaprekar number, because 552 = 3025, which can be
split into 30 and 25, and 30 + 25 = 55. There is one special rule: both
parts of this sum must be positive. This means that, for example, 10 is not a
Kaprekar number, even when 102 = 100 and 10+0=10 (but the second part
of the sum is zero  not positive).

Given a range of numbers, your task is to discover and print all Kaprekar numbers within that
range.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains a single number N , representing the number of test cases that follow
(1  N  1000).

Than follow exactly N lines (one for each test case), each one containing two positive integers
separated by a single space: INF and SUP (2  INF  SUP  40000), indicating that the range to
consider is the number interval [INF, SUP ] (this means that the limits are included in the interval to
consider).

```

## Output

```
For each test case you should start by printing a line in the format case #NUM  where NUM is the
test case number (starting in one).

Then, you must print all the Kaprekar numbers that appear in the respective range, in ascending
order, one per line. If there are no Kaprekar numbers in the specified interval, you should print no
kaprekar numbers.

There should also be a blank line between test cases.
