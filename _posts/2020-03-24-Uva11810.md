```
All of you must have heard the name of The Lord of
the Rings. As we know that the ring, that was said
to be the lord of the rings, was destroyed by Frodo
Baggins in the mountain of doom. And so, the evil
spirit Sauron was not able to capture the ring and
was finally destroyed. After defeating Saurons army,
Aragorn became the king and with his coronation the
world moved into the dominion of Men. And they
lived happily ever after.

But thats not actually the whole story. Defeating
Sauron was not the final victory over evil as such.
Because the evil dark lord and Saurons master 
Morgoth can still recover, grow and take shape again.

After the death of Sauron, many years have
passed. Aragorn is old now and his son Eldarion is the king. Things were going fine except one
day they discovered the fact that Morgoth has recovered his powers and is planning to take over the
world. The whole middle Earth is again waiting for another war.

Eldarion has made several plans with the wise council to stop Morgoth. They have the map, so
they are aware of the fact that there are some territories in Middle-Earth. Many two-way roads exist
between some pairs of territories. The times to travel all roads are known to them. To go from a
territory to another one, they can use one or more roads. And all territories are reachable from any
territory.

Thats why they have the fear that if Morgoths army enters to any territory then they can invade
any territory they want. To protect a road, huge number of armies has to be placed there.

Eldarion is a man of honor like his father. So, he doesnt want to leave any territory unguarded
or weak. But since his armies are little in number compared to Morgoths, he is at a loss. Cause if
he sends armies to protect the roads then they may win, but some territories might go down. But if
he sends the armies to protect the territories, then if any territory goes down, more will be in danger
because Morgoths army will forward their march using the unguarded roads and of course they can
capture roads and can hamper the communication amongst territories. But if Eldarion places armies
to protect both roads and territories then both roads and territories will be weak since the number of
armies protecting a territory or a road will be too low to fight against Morgoths army.

After a long discussion, they have got many ideas, but no idea fascinated Eldarion. So, he went to
his father, Aragorn  the old king. Aragorn took a day to think, and the next day he told his son
about his idea. The idea is to keep as fewer roads as possible such that the armies can still be sent from
any territory to all other territories. Rest of the roads will be destroyed. As they have many trebuchets
and catapults, they can destroy roads easily and without heavy effort.

After that they will pick some territories that have the higher chances to be attacked first. These
territories will be selected by Aragorn himself from his past experience in battles, and these are called
the prime territories. All the armies will be assigned to protect these territories only. When a territory
is under attack, either prime or non-prime, the informers in this territory will seek help from a prime
territory. This helping territory will be randomly chosen. After the arrival of the armies, the informers
will seek help from another randomly chosen prime territory. And they will continue seeking help until
armies from all the prime territories come. The informers will always choose a new prime territory for
seeking help. So, the estimated time for a territory is the total required time for armies from all prime

territories to reach this territory. And the Total estimated time is the summation of estimated times of
all territories. You can assume that the time to inform other territories is negligible.

Now, they are planning to use Aragorns idea. So, they want to keep the roads such that the Total
estimated time is as low as possible. You are one of the head councilors and you know the map fully.
Now you have to find the minimum Total estimated time. Remember that the whole middle earth is
depending on you.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input will contain T ( 100), denoting the number of cases.

Each case starts with a blank line. The next line will contain three integers n (2  n  16), m
and k (1  k  n), where n is the number of territories, m is the total number of roads and k is the
number of prime territories. The territories are numbered from 0 to n  1. The next line contains k
integers separated by spaces. These integers denote the prime territories. Each of the next m lines will
contain three integers u, v (0  u, v < n and u = v) and w (1  w  1000) denoting that there is a
two way road between territory u and v and the time to cross this road is w minutes. You can assume
that all the roads are valid, no road is listed more than once and multiple roads between same pair of
territories dont exist.
