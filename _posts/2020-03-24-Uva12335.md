of English alphabet but their ordering is different. You want to know the original order of the symbols
in that particular alphabet. You have a string consists of all the letters of that alphabet and you know
that this is the k-th (1 based) lexicographic permutation of these symbols. You have to arrange these
symbols in lexicographic order of that language.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input will contain an integer T (T  5000) which denotes the number of test cases.

Each of the following T lines contains a string s and an integer k. The string will be of length n
(1  n  20) and will consist of lowercase letters only. All the letters in the string will be distinct. The
value of k will be in the range (1  k  n!).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input output the case number and a string which contains the letters in lexicographic
order in that language.

abdc 2 cadb 14
acbd 3 cbad 15
acdb 4 cbda 16
adbc 5 cdab 17
adcb 6 cdba 18
bacd 7 dabc 19
badc 8 dacb 20
bcad 9 dbac 21
bcda 10 dbca 22
bdac 11 dcab 23
bdca 12 dcba 24

```

## Sample Output
