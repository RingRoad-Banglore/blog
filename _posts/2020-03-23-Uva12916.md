12916 Perfect Cyclic String
A perfect cyclic string is a string which can be represented as the repeated concatenation of one of its
substrings. In fact, all strings can be formed in such way, and perhaps with more than one possible
substring; substrings also can be the original string itself.

For example: The string “cdabcdabcdab” can be formed with the substring “cdab”. The string
“abababab” can be formed with the substrings “ab” or “abab”, or even “abababab”. And the string
“qwertyuiop” can be formed only with the substring “qwertyuiop” (the string itself).

Given some string, you must find the size of the minimum substring which can be used to form the
original given string.

## Input
The first line contains an integer number T not greater than 103 representing the amount of strings to
process. Each of the following T lines contains a string for processing of at most 103 lowercase letters of
the English alphabet. You can safely assume that the sum of lengths of all given strings do not exceed
5 · 105.

## Output
For each input string you must print an integer number with an end of line, representing the size of the
minimum substring which can be used to form the original given string.

## Sample Input
<p>5</p><p>aaaa</p><p>abababab</p><p>cdabcdabcdab</p><p>qwertyuiopasdfg</p><p>abcabcabcabcxabcabcabcabx</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>1</p><p>2</p><p>4</p><p>15</p><p>25</p>
