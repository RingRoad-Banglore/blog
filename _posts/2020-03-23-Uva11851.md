11851 Celebrity Split
Jack and Jill have decided to separate and divide their prop-
erty equally. Each of their N mansions has a value between
1,000,000 and 40,000,000 dollars. Jack will receive some of
the mansions; Jill will receive some of the mansions; the
remaining mansions will be sold, and the proceeds split
equally.

Neither Jack nor Jill can tolerate the other receiving
property with higher total value. The sum of the values of
the mansions Jack receives must be equal to the sum of the
values of the mansions Jill receives. So long as the value
that each receives is equal, Jack and Jill would like each to
receive property of the highest possible value.

Given the values of N mansions, compute the value of
the mansions that must be sold so that the rest may be
divided so as to satisfy Jack and Jill.

Example
Suppose Jack and Jill own 5 mansions valued at 6,000,000, 30,000,000, 3,000,000, 11,000,000, and

3,000,000 dollars. To satisfy their requirements, Jack or Jill would receive the mansion worth 6,000,000
and the other would receive both manstions worth 3,000,000 dollars. The mansions worth 11,000,000
and 30,000,000 dollars would be sold, for a total of 41,000,000 dollars. The answer is therefore 41000000.

## Input
The input consists of a sequence of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N , the number of mansions, which will be no more than 24. This line is followed by N lines, each
giving the value of a mansion. The final line of input contains the integer zero. This line is not a test
case and should not be processed.

## Output
For each test case, output a line containing a single integer, the value of the mansions that must be
sold so that the rest may be divided so as to satisfy Jack and Jill.
