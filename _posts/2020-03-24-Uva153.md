## Input

```text
Given a string of characters, we can permute the individual characters to make new strings. If we
can impose an ordering on the characters (say alphabetic sequence), then the strings themselves can
be ordered and any given permutation can be given a unique number designating its position in that
ordering. For example the string acab gives rise to the following 12 distinct permutations:

aabc 1 acab 5 bcaa 9
aacb 2 acba 6 caab 10
abac 3 baac 7 caba 11
abca 4 baca 8 cbaa 12

Thus the string acab can be characterised in this sequence as 5.

Write a program that will read in a string and determine its position in the ordered sequence of
permutations of its constituent characters. Note that numbers of permutations can get very large;
however we guarantee that no string will be given whose position is more than 2311 = 2, 147, 483, 647.
```

## Output

```text
Input will consist of a series of lines, each line containing one string. Each string will consist of up to
30 lower case letters, not necessarily distinct. The file will be terminated by a line consisting of a single
#.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each line of the input. Each line will consist of the
position of the string in its sequence, right justified in a field of width 10.

```

## Sample Output

```text
bacaa
abc
cba
#
