title: Uva 11955  Binomial Theorem
---


```
John likes mathematics a lot. His main passion is the binomial theorem. However it is rather hard to
calculate binomial coefficients, so he decided to write a computer program that can expand any power
of a sum into a sum of powers. Mathematically it can be written like this:

(a+ b)k = x1a
k + x2a

k1b+ x3a
k2b2 + . . .+ xk+1b

k

where x1...k+1 are binomial coefficients xi = Cik.
```

## Input

```
There is a number of tests T (T  100) on the first line. After T test follows. Each test is written on a
single line in form of (a+b)^k. Where a and b are same variables names. Variables names are strings
constructed from az characters. And k (1  k  50) is a power that you need to raise the sum.
You can assume that there are no lines longer than 100 characters.

```

## Output

```
For each test output a single line Case N: T . Where N is the test number (starting from 1) and T is
an expanded expression (see examples for clarification). By the way, you shouldnt output coefficients
and powers equal to one.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
(a+b)^1
(alpha+omega)^2
(acm+icpc)^3

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: a+b
Case 2: alpha^2+2*alpha*omega+omega^2
Case 3: acm^3+3*acm^2*icpc+3*acm*icpc^2+icpc^3
```
