10367 Equations
Given 2 equations on the variables x and y, solve for x and y.

## Input
The first line of input contains N , the number of test cases. Each
test case consists of two equations, each on a separate line. An
empty line separates cases. An equation consists of two or more
terms separated by addition, subtraction, or equality operators.
A term is an integer, or a variable name (x or y) optionally pre-
ceded by a minus sign or an integer coefficient.

There is exactly one equality operator. All operators are sur-
rounded by spaces, and there are no spaces within terms.

## Output
For each case, print two lines, giving the values of x and y as
rationals in simplest terms. If x or y has no unique rational value
such that both equations hold, print ‘don't know’ for its value.

Print an empty line between cases.
