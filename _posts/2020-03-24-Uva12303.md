## Input

```
Given n points and m planes in 3D place, you will need to perform t transformations on them, and
then calculate their final states. By transforming a plane, we mean transforming all the points on
that plane.

There are three kinds of transformations (in the text below, P means the point being transformed):

TRANSLATE a b c If P s position was (x, y, z), it becomes (x+ a, y + b, z + c) after the
transformation.

ROTATE a b c theta P is rotated. The rotation axis is vector (a, b, c), the angle of rota-
tion is theta degrees. The rotation follows the right-hand rule, so if
the vector (a, b, c) points toward you, the rotation will be counter-
clockwise from your point of view. The rotation axis always passes
through (0, 0, 0).

SCALE a b c If P s position was (x, y, z), it becomes (ax, by, cz) after the trans-
formation.

This problem uses right-hand coordinate system:
```

## Output

```
There will be only one test case, beginning with three integers n, m, t (1 
n,m  50, 000, 1  t  1, 000). Next n lines contain the coordinates of
each point. Next m lines contains four integers a, b, c, d to describe a plane
ax+ by + cz + d = 0 (at least one of a, b, c will be non-zero). Next t lines contain the operations. All
the input coordinates and parameters a, b, c, d are real numbers with absolute values not larger than
10. These input real numbers will have at most two digits after the decimal point. Parameter theta is
an integer between 0 and 359 (inclusive).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each point, print three real numbers x, y, z on a single line. For each plane, print four real numbers
a, b, c, d on a single line. To avoid floating-point issues, a2+ b2+ c2 must be 1, but if there is more than
one choice of (a, b, c, d) to represent the answer, anyone is acceptable. Output each real number to two
decimal places. To reduce the impact of floating-point errors, each number you print could differ from
the standard output by up to 0.05.

```

## Sample Output

```
1 1 3
1 2 3
0 0 1 -2
TRANSLATE 2 3 4
ROTATE 1 0 0 90
SCALE 3 2 1
