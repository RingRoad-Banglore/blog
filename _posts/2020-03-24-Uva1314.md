title: Uva 01314  Hidden Password
---


```

Some time the programmers have very strange ways to hide their passwords. See for example how Billy
Hacker Geits hide his password. Billy chooses a string S composed of small Latin letters with length
L. Then he makes all L 1 one-letter left cyclic shifts of the string and takes as a password one prefix
of the lexicographically first of the obtained strings (including S). For example let consider the string
alabala. The cyclic one-letter left shifts (including the initial string) are:

alabala

labalaa

abalaal

balaala

alaalab

laalaba

aalabal

and lexicographically first of them is the string aalabal. The first letter of this string is in position
6 in the initial string (the positions in the string are counted from 0).

Write a program that for given string S finds the start position of the smallest lexicographically
one-letter left cyclic shift of this string. If the smallest lexicographically left shift appears more than
once then the program have to output the smallest initial position.
```

## Input

```
Your program has to be ready to solve more than one test case. The first line of the input file will
contains only the number T of the test cases. Each of the following T lines will describe one test case
 first the length L of the string (5  L  100000) and then, separated by one space, the string S
itself.

```

## Output

```
The output file have to contain exactly T lines with a single number each  the initial position found
by your program.

## Sample Input

```

6 baabaa

7 alabala

```

## Sample Output

```
