---


## Input

```
The Fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...) are defined by the recurrence:

F0 = 0

F1 = 1

Fi = Fi1 + Fi2 for i > 1

Write a program which calculates Mn = Fn mod 2m for given pair of n and m. 0  n  2147483647
and 0  m < 20. Note that a mod b gives the remainder when a is divided by b.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several lines specifying a pair of n and m.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output should be corresponding Mn, one per line.

```

## Sample Output

```
11 7
11 6
