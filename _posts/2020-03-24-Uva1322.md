title: Uva 01322  Minimizing Maximizer
---


## Input

```text

The company Chris Ltd. is preparing a new sorting hardware called Maximizer. Maximizer has n
inputs numbered from 1 to n. Each input represents one integer. Maximizer has one output which
represents the maximum value present on Maximizers inputs.

Maximizer is implemented as a pipeline of sorters Sorter(i1, j1), . . . , Sorter(ik, jk). Each sorter has
n inputs and n outputs. Sorter(i, j) sorts values on inputs i, i + 1, . . . , j in non-decreasing order and
lets the other inputs pass through unchanged. The n-th output of the last sorter is the output of the
Maximizer.

An intern (a former ACM contestant) observed that some sorters could be excluded from the pipeline
and Maximizer would still produce the correct result. What is the length of the shortest subsequence of
the given sequence of sorters in the pipeline still producing correct results for all possible combinations
of input values?

Task
Write a program that:

 reads the description of a Maximizer, i.e. the initial sequence of sorters in the pipeline,

 computes the length of the shortest subsequence of the initial sequence of sorters still producing
correct results for all possible input data,

 writes the result.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test case, each separated by a blank line. The first line of the file indicates the
number of test cases, and its followed by a blank line.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2  n  50000, 1  m  500000)
separated by a single space. Integer n is the number of inputs and integer m is the number of sorters
in the pipeline. The initial sequence of sorters is described in the next m lines. The k-th of these lines
contains the parameters of the k-th sorter: two integers ik and jk (1  ik < jk  n) separated by a
single space.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of only one line containing an integer equal to the length of the shortest subsequence
of the initial sequence of sorters still producing correct results for all possible data.

Print a blank line between test cases.
