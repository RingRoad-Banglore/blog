title: Uva 12691  Seven Segment Display
---


## Input

```

Seven segment numeric displays are ubiquitous. It uses seven segments to display numbers.

Here is a figure which depicts all the segments used in a typical seven segment display (Well be
using the acronym SSD for convenience from now on).

Figure 1: Segments used for SSD representation.
Here, DP represents decimal place which is not necessary in the context of this problem.

And here are the numbers from 0 to 9 represented in SSD.

0 uses segments A, B, C, D, E, F
1: B, C
2: A, B, G, E, D
3: A, B, C, D, G
4: B, C, F, G
5: A, C, D, F, G
6: A, C, D, E, F, G
7: A, B, C
8: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
9: A, B, C, D, F, G

Now, imagine the SSD representation of a digit as a graph. The endpoints of the segments are the
nodes and segments are edges. So, the digits will look like:

We call this representation a 0-degree SSD graph. A k-degree (k > 0) SSD graph is made by dividing
each edge of a 0-degree graph into k + 1 edges and introducing k nodes in between them.

To explain more, 1-degree graphs of all digits are shown below. The darker nodes are the newly
introduced nodes.

Youll be given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Youll need to print all the (degree, digit) pairs
for which the given graph is valid.

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer which denotes the number of test cases T (1  T  20).
T sets of case will follow. Each case will start with a couple of numbers n (1  n  500) and m
(1  m  1000)  the number of nodes and the number of edges respectively. Each of the next m lines
will contain a pair of numbers (u, v) meaning that there is an edge from node u to node v. Nodes are
numbered from 1 to n. Its guaranteed that there is no duplicate or self-edges in the input.

## Sample Input

```
For each set of inputs, output one set of output. First line of a set should be of the format, Case X:
Y  (here, X is the serial of the input and Y is the number of (digit, degree) pairs) in a line. Then
print each (digit, degree) pair  one pair in each line. The pairs should be sorted according to digit
first then degree. Each number in a pair should be separated with a space. Print a blank line between
consecutive test cases.
