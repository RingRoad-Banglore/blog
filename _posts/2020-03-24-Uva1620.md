title: Uva 01620  Lazy Susan
---


## Input

```

There are N marbles, which are labeled 1, 2, . . . , N . The N marbles are put in a circular track in an
arbitrary order. In the top part of the track there is a lazy Susan, which is a tray that can hold
exactly 4 marbles. The tray can be rotated, reversing the orientation of the four marbles. The tray can
also be moved around the track in both directions.

For example, 9 marbles 1, 9, 8, 3, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2 are put in the circular track in clockwise order as
shown in the following figure. This figure also shows how the tray is moved and rotated.

Trung wants you to arrange the marbles by moving and rotating the tray so that when listing the
marbles from some position in the track in clockwise order, we get (1, 2, . . . , N). Your task is to write
a program to tell Trung that either this can be done or not.
```

## Output

```
The input file consists of several data sets. The first line of the input file contains the number of data
sets which is a positive integer and is not bigger than 100. The following lines describe the data sets.

For each data set, the first line contains the integer N (8  N  500). The second line describes
the initial state of the track. It contains N numbers which are the labels of the marbles when listing
in clockwise order.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, write in one line possible if there exists a solution to arrange the marbles. If not
so, write impossible.
