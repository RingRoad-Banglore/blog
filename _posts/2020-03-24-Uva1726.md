title: Uva 01726  Automatic Cheater Detection
---


## Input

```text
In recent times a very bad incident is happening
repeatedly in Wonderland ((Poets Poets claim
that she is the queen of all countries), ques-
tions of many public examination and admis-
sion tests are being leaked before the exam.
The effect is less terrible when the exam in-
volved is a written public exam, because still
one has to go to exam halls and write things
correctly. But if the exam involved has only
MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) the situa-
tion becomes grave  anyone who has a little
bit of memorization power can get good marks
if he gets MCQ questions with solution the day
before the exam.

For technical reasons and added expendi-
ture, such an MCQ based exam cannot always
be taken again. So you are given the responsibility of detecting cheaters of such an MCQ based exam.
The details of this exam and cheater detection process is given below:

(a) There are at most 50000 MCQ questions in the exam.

(b) All questions have a difficulty, a status and a result associated with it. This difficulty is denoted
with an integer d between 1 and 10 (Inclusive). The higher the value of d, the more difficult the
question is. The status s can be either 1 (The question was leaked) or 0 (The question was not
leaked). The result r is either c (The answer given by the student is correct) or i (The answer
given by the student is incorrect). So a single MCQ question is denoted with two integers d, s
and a character r.

(c) A suspicious activity is counted when someone answers a leaked question with difficulty d1 cor-
rectly but fails to answer a not leaked question with difficulty d2 correctly and (d1 > d2).

(d) Given the description of questions in a set (including the correctness of each question for a
particular examinee) your job is to write a program to find the total number of suspicious activities
for that examinee.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input file contains a positive integer T (T  80) which denotes the number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

Each test case starts with a positive integer Q (1  Q  50000) which denotes the number of
questions in the exam and each of the next Q lines describes 1 MCQ question. Each of the line contains
two integers di (1  di  10), si and a character ri, here di denotes the difficulty, si denotes the status
(1 means it was leaked and 0 means that it was not leaked) and ri denotes whether the examinee
answered the question correctly (c) or incorrectly (i). In reality a day long MCQ exam does not have
50000 questions but this is just being given as input to test the efficiency of your algorithm as your
program will be used to find cheaters among ten million students in a very short time.

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer which denotes the total
number of suspicious activities for the given input.

Illustration of the Sample Input below:
In sample 1, one suspicious activity is that the first not leaked question was answered incorrectly

but the second leaked question was answered correctly (Although first one had a higher difficulty). The
other suspicious activity is that first not leaked question was answered incorrectly but the third leaked
question was answered correctly (Although it had a higher difficulty). So the total no of suspicious
activities is 2.

Similarly, in 2nd sample there are four suspicious activities with the answering of the following
question pairs (Q2, Q1), (Q4, Q1), (Q2, Q3), (Q4, Q3)

```

## Sample Output

```text

2 0 i
3 1 c
4 1 c
5 1 i

2 0 i
4 1 c
3 0 i
5 1 c
