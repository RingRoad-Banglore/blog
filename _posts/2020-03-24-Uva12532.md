## Input

```text

Its normal to feel worried and tense the day before a programming contest. To relax, you went out for
a drink with some friends in a nearby pub. To keep your mind sharp for the next day, you decided to
play the following game. To start, your friends will give you a sequence of N integers X1, X2, . . . , XN .
Then, there will be K rounds; at each round, your friends will issue a command, which can be:

 a change command, when your friends want to change one of the values in the sequence; or

 a product command, when your friends give you two values I, J and ask you if the product
XI XI+1  . . .XJ1 XJ is positive, negative or zero.

Since you are at a pub, it was decided that the penalty for a wrong answer is to drink a pint of
beer. You are worried this could affect you negatively at the next days contest, and you dont want
to check if Ballmers peak theory is correct. Fortunately, your friends gave you the right to use your
notebook. Since you trust more your coding skills than your math, you decided to write a program to
help you in the game.
```

## Output

```text
Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains two integers N and K, indicating
respectively the number of elements in the sequence and the number of rounds of the game (1 
N,K  105). The second line contains N integers Xi that represent the initial values of the sequence
(100  Xi  100 for i = 1, 2, . . . , N). Each of the next K lines describes a command and starts with
an uppercase letter that is either C or P. If the letter is C, the line describes a change command, and
the letter is followed by two integers I and V indicating that XI must receive the value V (1  I  N
and 100  V  100). If the letter is P, the line describes a product command, and the letter
is followed by two integers I and J indicating that the product from XI to XJ , inclusive must be
calculated (1  I  J  N). Within each test case there is at least one product command.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a line with a string representing the result of all the product commands in
the test case. The i-th character of the string represents the result of the i-th product command. If the
result of the command is positive the character must be + (plus); if the result is negative the character
must be - (minus); if the result is zero the character must be 0 (zero).
