## Input

```text

Whittingtons cat is very well trained

Whittington is showing his trained cat in its
surprising feat of going from A to Z, grabbing
all the mice in his way while stepping on each
circle just once.

You receive an arbitrary, undirected graph,
where each node is identifed by a single upper-
case letter. One vertex is the source, or starting
point, and the other is the target, or end point.

Your job is to imitate the cats ability, and
identify a path that goes from the source to
the target, visiting each node in the graph ex-
actly once. If there is more than one valid path,
choose the lexicographically lowest one.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases.

Theres a blank line at the beginning of each case. Then two integers are given in a single line:
N and M , representing the number of nodes and the number of bi-directional edges in the graph,
respectively. You can assume that there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes, and that each
edge will be reported only once.

The next line will contain N distinct letters, separated by spaces, which are the identifers for all
the nodes in the graph. The frst letter in this list will be the source, the last letter will be the target.
All letters will be uppercase letters from the English alphabet.

Then M lines will be presented, describing the edges of the graph. Each of these lines contain two
distinct letters, which describe two nodes that are connected by an edge.

T  60; 2  N  15

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the sequence of letters that describe the path
from the source to the target, visiting all nodes exactly once.

If a valid solution doesnt exist, print the word impossible.
