title: Uva 12942  Subexpression Counting
---


```
Suppose we want to search arithmetic expressions for sub-expressions of certain shape. We are consid-
ering only fully parenthesized expressions with binary operators, numerical constants, and variables, as
defined in the following BNF-like notation:

expr ::= var | num | (exprbinopexpr)
var ::= a | b |    | z

num ::= digit | digitnum
digit ::= 0 | 1 |    | 9
binop ::= + | - | * | /

For example, consider the arithmetic expressions  and  defined as follows:

 : (x+ (3  z))
 : ((x+ (3  z)) ((5 (2 y))/y)).

The syntax tree associated to each one of these arithmetic expressions is shown below:

+

x 

3 z

-

+

x 

3 z

/

-

5 -

2 y

y

 

We want to report all nodes v in  such that the sub-tree rooted at v is structurally identical to
, ignoring all labels in the nodes. In this case, there are 2 such nodes because: (i) expression  is a
sub-expression of  and (ii) sub-expression (5  (2  y)) of  has the same tree structure as . The
corresponding sub-trees have been shaded in the syntax tree of  depicted above.

Your task is to write an efficient computer program that, given inputs  and , computes the number
of nodes v in  such that the sub-tree rooted at v is structurally identical to .
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line describes
the expression  and the second one the expression . You can assume that 1  ||  400000 and
1  ||  400000, and that these expressions do not contain any blanks.

identical to .
