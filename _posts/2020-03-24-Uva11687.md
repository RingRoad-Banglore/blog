title: Uva 11687  Digits
---


```
A googol written out in decimal has 101
digits. A googolplex has one plus a googol
digits. Thats a lot of digits!

Given any number x0, define a se-
quence using the following recurrence:

xi+1 = the number of digits in the deci-
mal representation of xi

Your task is to determine the smallest
positive i such that xi = xi1.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several lines. Each line
contains a value of x0. Every value of x0
is non-negative and has no more than one million digits. The last line of input contains the word END.

```

## Output

```
For each value of x0 given in the input, output one line containing the smallest positive i such that
xi = xi1.

```

## Sample Input

```
42
END

```

## Sample Output

```
3
```
