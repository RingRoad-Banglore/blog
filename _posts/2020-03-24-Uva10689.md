title: Uva 10689  Yet another Number Sequence
---


```
Lets define another number sequence, given by the following function:

f(0) = a

f(1) = b

f(n) = f(n 1) + f(n 2), n > 1

When a = 0 and b = 1, this sequence gives the Fibonacci Sequence. Changing the values of a and
b, you can get many different sequences. Given the values of a, b, you have to find the last m digits of
f(n).
```

## Input

```
The first line gives the number of test cases, which is less than 10001. Each test case consists of a
single line containing the integers a b n m. The values of a and b range in [0, 100], value of n ranges in
[0, 1000000000] and value of m ranges in [1, 4].

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the last m digits of f(n). However, you should NOT print any leading zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
0 1 11 3
0 1 42 4
0 1 22 4
0 1 21 4

```

## Sample Output

```
89
4296
7711
946
```
