title: Uva 01092  Tracking Biobots
---


```
The researchers at International Bio-bot Makers (IBM) have invented a new kind of Bio-bot, a robot
with behavior mimicking biological organisms. The development of the new robot is at a primitive
stage; they now resemble simple four-wheeled rovers. And like most modern robots, Bio-bots are not
very mobile. Their weak motors and limited turning capability put considerable limitations on their
movement, even in simple, relatively obstacle-free environments.

Currently the Bio-bots operate in a room which can be described as an m  n grid. A Bio-bot
occupies a full square on this grid. The exit is in the northeast corner, and the room slopes down
towards it, which means the Bio-bots are only capable of moving north or east at any time. Some
squares in the room are also occupied by walls, which completely block the robot. Figure 1, which
corresponds to the sample input, shows an example of such a room.

Clearly, a Bio-bot located on square A is capable of leaving the room, while one at square B is
trapped inside it, no matter what it does. Locations like B are called stuck squares. (Walls do not
count as stuck squares.) Given the description of a room, your job is to count the total number of stuck
squares in the room.

## Input

```
Input consists of multiple test cases, each describing one room. Each test case begins with a line
containing three integers m, n, and w (1  m,n  106, 0  w  1000). These indicate that the room
contains m rows, n columns, and w horizontal walls.

Each of the next w lines contains four integers x1, y1, x2, y2, the coordinates of the squares delimiting
one wall. All walls are aligned from west to east, so 0  x1  x2 < n and 0  y1 = y2 < m. Walls
do not overlap each other. The southwest corner of the room has coordinates (0,0) and the northeast
corner has coordinates (n 1,m 1).

The last test case is followed by a line containing three zeros.
