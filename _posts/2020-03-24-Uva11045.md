title: Uva 11045  My Tshirt suits me
---


## Input

```
Our friend Victor participates as an instructor in an environmental volunteer program. His boss asked
Victor to distribute N T-shirts to M volunteers, one T-shirt each volunteer, where N is multiple of six,
and N  M . There are the same number of T-shirts of each one of the six available sizes: XXL, XL,
L, M , S, and XS. Victor has a little problem because only two sizes of the T-shirts suit each volunteer.

You must write a program to decide if Victor can distribute T-shirts in such a way that all volunteers
get a T-shirt that suit them. If N = M , there can be some remaining T-shirts.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a line with two
numbers N and M . N is multiple of 6, 1  N  36, and indicates the number of T-shirts. Number M ,
1  M  30, indicates the number of volunteers, with N  M . Subsequently, M lines are listed where
each line contains, separated by one space, the two sizes that suit each volunteer (XXL, XL, L, M , S, or
XS).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case you are to print a line containing YES if there is, at least, one distribution where
T-shirts suit all volunteers, or NO, in other case.
