title: Uva 10522  Height to Area
---


```
Its an easy geometry problem. For any triangle ABC we know that the height from A to the line BC
(or its extension) is Ha, from B to the line AC (or its extension) is Hb and from C to the line AB (or
its extension) is Hc. Now you are given these three values and you have to figure out the area of the
ABC
```

## Input

```
At first the input will be an integer n. Which denotes the number of invalid inputs after which the
input will terminate. Then there will be three real numbers Ha, Hb and Hc per line.

```

## Output

```
For each input block there should be one output line. For valid inputs the line contains the area of the
ABC up to 3 decimal places after the decimal point and for invalid inputs there will be a line These
are invalid inputs!. After n invalid input sets the program will terminate.

```

## Sample Input
