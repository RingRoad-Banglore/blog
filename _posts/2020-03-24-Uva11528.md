title: Uva 11528  Switch Grid
---


## Input

```

There is a grid with N rows and M columns. The rows are numbered from 0 to N  1 and columns are
numbered from 0 to M  1. Each of the cell in row 0 and each of the cell in column 0 contains a bulb.
Except the cell in row 0 and column 0 is empty. All the other rows can contain a switch. The switch in
the cell on row r and column c change the states of both bulbs in row r and column c. You are given
the initial states and the desired states of each of the bulb. Now given a list of switches you need to
press them in such a way that all the bulbs change their states from their initial to desired states.
```

## Output

```
Input contains multiple test cases. First line contains T the number of test cases. Each of the test case
consists of 7 lines.

1. 3 space separated integers N (1  N  1000),M (1  M  1000) and S (1  S  4000). N is
the number of rows in the grid, M is the number of columns in the grid and S is the number of
switches.

2. N  1 space separated integers. Each of these integers is either 0 or 1. The i-th (i starts from
1) denotes the initial state of the bulb in (i, 0). 0 means off and 1 means on.

3. N  1 space separated integers. Each of these integers is either 0 or 1. The i-th (i starts from
1) denotes the final state of the bulb in (i, 0).

4. M  1 space separated integers. Each of these integers is either 0 or 1. The i-th (i starts from
1) denotes the initial state of the bulb in (0, i).

5. M  1 space separated integers. Each of these integers is either 0 or 1. The i-th (i starts from
1) denotes the final state of the bulb in (0, i).

6. S space separated integers. Each of these integers is between 1 and N  1 inclusive. The i-th (i
starts from 0) integers denote the row number of the i-th switch.

7. S space separated integers. Each of these integers is between 1 and M  1 inclusive. The i-th (i
starts from 0) integers denote the column number of the i-th switch.

There is a blank line after each of the test case. There will be 100 test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output contains a single line. When there is no way to transform the state of all the
bulbs the line contains -1. Otherwise the line starts with X followed by X integers. X is the number
of switch presses required to transform all the bulbs into the desired states. X should be less than
10000. The next X integers denotes the indices of the switches that need to be pressed. All of these
X integers should be distinct. Any combination of switch presses that transforms all the bulbs to their
desired state will be considered correct.
