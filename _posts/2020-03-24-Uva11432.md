title: Uva 11432  Busy Programmer

## Input

```
Our famous programmer Gordov Mia (Mr. Donkey) is having a very busy time in his office. His
erratic boss has assigned him to two projects (project MICRO and project GOO) at the same time.
Consequently, problems have occurred while making a feasible work schedule for him. The boss needs
to submit a report to the CEO specifying the schedule of work for all the resources working under him
for a period of 2D days. Gordov must work D days on each project. He doesnt work more than a single
project on a particular day. Gordov must finish the work of the project he started earlier (i.e. on the
first day of the schedule) first. As the progress of both the projects depends on him, he can not be away
from any project for more than G consecutive days. (of course unless a project is already complete.)
For example, if D = 3 and G = 2, there can be ten valid schedules,

Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6
1 MICRO MICRO GOO MICRO GOO GOO
2 GOO GOO MICRO GOO MICRO MICRO
3 MICRO MICRO GOO GOO MICRO GOO
4 GOO GOO MICRO MICRO GOO MICRO
5 MICRO GOO MICRO MICRO GOO GOO
6 GOO MICRO GOO GOO MICRO MICRO
7 MICRO GOO MICRO GOO MICRO GOO
8 GOO MICRO GOO MICRO GOO MICRO
9 MICRO GOO GOO MICRO MICRO GOO
10 GOO MICRO MICRO GOO GOO MICRO

Now, Given D and G, you are to determine the number of possible schedules with the given con-
straints.
```

## Output

```
There are around 2400 test cases in the input file. Every test case has two non-negative integers, D
and G (D,G  33) on a line by itself. A case with D = G = 1 terminates the input. This case must
not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a line in the format Case x: y where x is the case number and y is the
number of possible schedules.

```

## Sample Output

```
3 2
3 1
-1 -1

```
