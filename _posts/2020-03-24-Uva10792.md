title: Uva 10792  The LaurelHardy Story
---


## Input

```
Laurel and Hardy are two famous movie char-
acters of the 50s. They are well known for their
differences in weight as you can see in the pic-
ture on the left. In case you dont know them I
should add that Laurel was the lighter guy. In
their younger days Laurel and Hardy used to
play with a strange seesaw and when the see-
saw was at a stable position Hardy was always
nearer the ground. We will now investigate a
two dimensional version of their seesaw.

The seesaw that Laurel Hardy used can be
considered as part of a circle of radius r, as
shown in the picture below (Filled gray and
having the shape of a D). Hardy sat on point B
(rightmost point of the seesaw) and Laurel sat on point A (Leftmost point of the seesaw top AB). d=EF
is the distance between the midpoint of line AB and arc AFB. So E is the midpoint of line AB and F is
the midpoint of arc AFB. MN is the ground of the seesaw, which is horizontal with the plane. BD=h1
is the distance of Hardy from the ground. Your job is to find out the distance of Laurel (denoted by
h2=AC) from the ground.

## Output

```
First line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N  1000), which indicates how many sets of
inputs are there. Each of the next N lines contains a single set of input. The description of each set is
given below:

Each line contains three integers r (10  r  100), d (5  d  r), h1 (5  h1  d). The meanings
of these integers are given in the problem statement above.

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by a
floating-point number, which indicates the value of h2. This floating-point number should be rounded
up to four digits after the decimal point. Look at the output for sample input for details.
