place to another.

The people of Amardesh is very irritated with this as all the roads are blocked when Prime Minister
Bodi is traveling to ensure his security, and the people has to suffer for that. So the Government has
decided to let Bodi travel each road only once and build some flyovers, which connects two notable
places, so that he can complete his visit to all the notable places while going through every road in
Khakha city. Bodi can start his journey at any place and end at any place you select. Please note, all
roads are flyovers are bi-directional.

You are given this task to minimize the cost of building flyovers for Bodi to complete his journey.
The cost to build a flyover is the square of the Euclidean distance between two notable points. You can
assume that all the notable places are already connected with each other.
