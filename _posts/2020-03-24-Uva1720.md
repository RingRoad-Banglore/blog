title: Uva 01720  Weather Report
---


```

You have been hired by the Association for Climatological
Measurement, a scientific organization interested in track-
ing global weather trends over a long period of time. Of
course, this is no easy task. They have deployed many
small devices around the world, designed to take periodic
measurements of the local weather conditions. These are
cheap devices with somewhat restricted capabilities. Ev-
ery day they observe which of the four standard kinds of
weather occurred: Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, or Frogs. After
every n of these observations have been made, the results
are reported to the main server for analysis. However, the
massive number of devices has caused the available com-
munication bandwidth to be overloaded. The Association needs your help to come up with a method
of compressing these reports into fewer bits.

For a particular devices location, you may assume that the weather each day is an independent
random event, and you are given the predicted probabilities of the four possible weather types. Each
of the 4n possible weather reports for a device must be encoded as a unique sequence of bits, such
that no sequence is a prefix of any other sequence (an important property, or else the server would not
know when each sequence ends). The goal is to use an encoding that minimizes the expected number
of transmitted bits.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line of input contains an integer 1  n  20, the number of observations that go into each

report. The second line contains four positive floating-point numbers, psunny, pcloudy, prainy, and pfrogs,
representing the respective weather probabilities. These probabilities have at most 6 digits after the
decimal point and sum to 1.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, display the minimum expected number of bits in the encoding of a report, with an
absolute or relative error of at most 104.
