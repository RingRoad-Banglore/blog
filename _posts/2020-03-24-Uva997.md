title: Uva 00997  Show the Sequence

## Input

```text

The problem of finding the next term of a given sequence of numbers is usually proposed in QI tests.
We want to generate the N terms of a sequence from a given codification of the sequence.

Let S = (Si)iIN denote a sequence of real numbers whose i-order term is Si. We codify a constant
sequence with the following operator:

S = [n] meaning that Si = n i  IN,

where n  ZZ. We also define the following operators on a given sequence of numbers S = (Si)iIN:

V = [m+ S] meaning that Vi =

{
m , i = 1
Vi1 + Si1 , i > 1

;

V = [m  S] meaning that Vi =
{
m  S1 , i = 1
Vi1  Si , i > 1

;

where m  IN. For example we have the following codifications:
[2 + [1]] = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6    [1 + [2 + [1]]] = 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36   

[2  [1 + [2 + [1]]]] = 2, 6, 36, 360, 5400, 113400    [2  [5 + [2]]] = 10, 30, 30,30, 90,450, 3150   
Given a codification, the problem is to write the first N terms of the sequence.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases. For each of them, the program input is a single line containing
the codification, without any space, followed by an integer N (2  N  50).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the program output is a single line containing the list of first N terms of the sequence.

Examples

Input Output

[1+[2+[1]]] 5 1 3 6 10 15

[2*[1+[2+[1]]]] 6 2 6 36 360 5400 113400

```

## Sample Output

```text
[2+[1]] 3

[2*[5+[-2]]] 7

```
