title: Uva 11016  Square Counting
---


## Input

```
A simple polygon with vertices having integer coor-
dinates is placed on a checker board. Determine the
number of light and dark squares completely encom-
passed by the polygon.
```

## Output

```
The input will contain several test cases (at most 25).
Each test case starts with an integer N , the number
of vertices (3  N  100) of the polygon. Then
N lines follow, each containing two integers x and
y, describing the coordinates of the polygon vertices
(0  x  10000, 0  y  10000). The input ends
with a case when N equals 0, which should not be
processed. You can assume that the top left corner has coordinate (0,0). The picture above corresponds
to the first sample input.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a line containing two space separated integers, the number of light and dark
squares completely encompassed by the polygon in descending order.
