title: Uva 12785  Emacs Plugin

## Input

```text

Emacs is a text editor characterized by its extensibility via plugins. Sometimes Emacs is described as
the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor. Nowadays, Emacs is one of
the main contenders in the traditional editor wars of Unix culture.

As a seasoned veteran in the competitive programming scene, Emacs is most of the time your editor
of choice. You wish you could always use it but this is not possible because of a feature that is currently
not working as expected: a very specific text search capability. In particular, you have gathered proof
that searching a text against a regular expression pattern takes a considerable amount of time for some
special kinds of patterns. As usual, to the extents of your ego, you are certain that you can implement
a much better specific purpose algorithm than the general purpose one currently shipping with Emacs.

A text is a string made from lowercase letters (a to z). A pattern is a string made from lowercase
letters and the wild-card symbol (*). The pattern p matches a text t iff p can be found in t as a
substring, with each symbol * in p witnessing an arbitrary substring in t.

For example, let t =heyhelloyou, p1 =hel*, p2 =*o*e, and p3 =e*o. Note that p1 matches t
with * witnessing, for example, the substring loyo or even the empty string . Also, p3 matches t
with, for example, witness lloy. However, p2 does not match t.

You have decided to implement a new algorithm for matching a pattern to a text as part of a new
Emacs plugin. Can you come up with a very efficient algorithm?
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with an integer number n indicating the
number of patterns on a single line (1  n  50). The next line contains the text t (1  |t|  105). The
next n lines contain the patterns p1, p2, . . . , pn (1  |pi|  105 for each 1  i  n), each on a single line.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output n lines, where the i-th line indicates whether pi matches t or not. If pi matches
t, then output yes; otherwise, output no.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4

*o*e

e*o
