title: Uva 00833  Water Falls
---


## Input

```text
Consider the set of line segments P1, P2 and P3 of figure 1, representing the side view of a set of
planes. What happens if some water falls (in the vertical direction and ignoring horizontal deviations
created by kinetics) from source point Sa? It flows over the plane P3, to P1, finally falling on the
ground at the point Ga. It is easy to see that, if the water is falling from source point Sb, then it hits
the ground at the point Gb.

Figure 1 - Water is falling from Sa and Sb to Ga and Gb respectively.

Given a list of lines segments and a list of source points, the proposed problem is to determine
the corresponding falling points on the ground. To simplify the problem, it is assumed that neither
horizontal lines nor crossing lines are given. Also no coincidences exist in the vertical projection of all
points (the x coordinates of the end points and of the source points are all different).
```

## Output

```text
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The input is a text file, containing several lines as follows.
The first line of the input contains the number NP (integer format) of line segments. It is followed

by NP lines containing, each one, the coordinates of the two end points of a segment, in the sequence
x1 y1 x2 y2, separated by single spaces. No order is supposed, for this case, between point 1 and point
2 and numbers are written in the integer format.

The next line is the number NS (integer format) of source points. It is followed by NS lines
containing, each one, a pair of integer values x y, separated by a single space, which are the coordinates
of the corresponding source point.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

NS lines of text containing, each one, the coordinate x (integer format) of the corresponding falling
point G. The output values must keep the input order.
