title: Uva 00503  Parallelepiped walk
---


## Input

```text
Two points A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2) are placed on the
surface of parallelepiped P = {(x, y, z) : 0  x  L, 0 
y  W, 0  z  H} with L W H dimensions (see figure).
These two points can be linked with various curves lying
on the surface of P . You are to find out the square of the
shortest curve length.

Parallelepiped dimensions L, W , H and coordinates of
the points are integers, 0  L,W,H  1000.
```

## Output

```text
The input data file consists of a series of lines with
each line containing 9 integers (in indicated order):
L,W,H, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2. The numbers are separated
with spaces.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input there will be one line of output, which should contain the square of the shortest
curve length between points A and B on the surface of P .

```

## Sample Output

```text
5 5 2 3 1 2 3 5 0
300 600 900 300 550 0 0 550 900
