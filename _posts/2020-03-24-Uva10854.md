## Input

```
Although testing is a technique which does not allow us to prove the correctness of a program, it is
used to assess its reliability, thus increasing our confidence in its correctness. In the literature, there
are many testing methods to select test cases which are applied as an input to the program.

A programmer has the intention of testing a program. With this aim in mind, he needs to know
how many test cases he should obtain such that each distinct path of execution is covered with a test
case. Your task is to write a program which computes the number of different paths of execution from
the initial sentence to the final sentence, in a given program P .
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains the number of programs. Subsequently, each program is listed. Each
program consists of a set of sentences with a keyword per line. The program finishes with the keyword
ENDPROGRAM

There are only two types of sentences: conditional and non-conditional. A non-conditional sentence
is represented by means of the keyword S. A conditional sentence is represented by the keywords IF,
ELSE and END_IF. The condition of the IF sentence is omitted (i.e., only the IF keyword appears) and
it is supposed that all IF sentences have a corresponding ELSE. So, for example, the shortest program
with a conditional sentence would be:

IF
ELSE
END_IF
ENDPROGRAM

which has 2 paths of execution.

```

## Sample Input

```
For every program you are to print a line containing the number N of different paths of execution. It
is supposed that N is never greater than 2  32.

```

## Sample Output

```
