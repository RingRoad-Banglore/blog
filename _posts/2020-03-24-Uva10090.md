title: Uva 10090  Marbles
---


```
I have some (say, n) marbles (small glass balls) and I am going to buy some boxes to store them. The
boxes are of two types:

Type 1: each box costs c1 Taka and can hold exactly n1 marbles

Type 2: each box costs c2 Taka and can hold exactly n2 marbles

I want each of the used boxes to be filled to its capacity and also to minimize the total cost of buying
them. Since I find it difficult for me to figure out how to distribute my marbles among the boxes, I
seek your help. I want your program to be efficient also.
```

## Input

```
The input file may contain multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer
n (1  n  2, 000, 000, 000). The second line contains c1 and n1, and the third line contains c2 and n2.
Here, c1, c2, n1 and n2 are all positive integers having values smaller than 2,000,000,000.

A test case containing a zero for n in the first line terminates the input.

```

## Output

```
For each test case in the input print a line containing the minimum cost solution (two nonnegative
integers m1 and m2, where mi = number of Typei boxes required) if one exists, print failed otherwise.

If a solution exists, you may assume that it is unique.
