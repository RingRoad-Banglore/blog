The Eagles Nest is an action adventure game. The
basic idea of the game is to beat up the good guys,
create public nuisance, gather money through differ-
ent illegal activities and gradually become a success-
ful gangster. But being a gangster is not so simple,
not in this game, at least.

The game has a non-linear storyline which allows
the players to choose from multiple alternate mis-
sions. However, there is a catch. A player can only
play the missions that are harder than all the mis-
sions that he/she has completed. And once a mission
is successfully completed it is no longer available for
the current player. The only exception to this rule
is the first mission and the final mission, which are
never removed and does not even appear in the list of
missions. As you might have guessed, the first mission
is the easiest, and the final mission is the hardest. It
is pretty obvious that one gets to complete the game
without playing many missions. Thats why, the authors of the game has provided some goodies to the
player who would be able to complete the maximum number of missions. And trust me; the goodies
are worth playing for. Youd get more health, more ammo, and more good guys to beat up!

For the hardcore gamers, there is some more exciting news. Let K be the maximum number
of missions that can be completed when one plays the game for the first time. If one can play the
game multiple times (starting at the first mission and finishing with the final mission) so that exactly
K number of missions is completed every time and one completes the maximum number of missions
possible under the given constraints, then the player would be given infinite ammo and invincibility.
And thats not all; all the missions would be unlocked for the player. That means infinite ammo, infinite
health and infinite amount of good guys left at your mercy.

Your task is plain and simple. You are to help a hardcore gamer by giving out the maximum
number of missions that can be completed under the given constraints. Please remember, the order of
the missions is important, as they are based on a storyline.
```

## Input

```
There can be at most 20 test cases in the input file. Each test case begins with an integer N , 2 < N <
100. Each of the next N lines will give you the name of the mission and the difficulty level. The name
of the mission will be a string of at most 20 characters, and the difficulty level would be a positive
integer. You can assume that the names of the missions are case sensitive and they would be composed
of alpha numeric characters and underscore only. The difficulty level would be at most 108. In a test
case no mission name would be duplicated. The input ends with a case where N = 0, you must not
process this case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case print the case number followed by a single integer in one line. This integer should
be the maximum number of missions that can be completed under the given constraints. This number

of missions excludes the first and the final mission.

Note: If you are confused with the first test case you can try doing the following things:

1. Read the problem statement again.

2. Talk to your team mates.

3. Read the following explanation: for the first case, the player can play the game 3 times, each time
completing one mission only. The first mission and the final mission will always be played, but
they will never be counted.

4. Or try a combination of the previous three.
