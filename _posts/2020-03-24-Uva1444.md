```

You are in a library equipped with bookracks that move on rails. There are many parallel rails, i.e.,
the bookracks are organized in several rows, see figure:

The boockracks in the library. There is no passage to the librarian at the moment.

To borrow a book, you have to find the librarian, who seems to hide on the opposite side of the
bookracks. Your task then is to move the racks along the rails so that a passage forms. Each rack has a
certain integer width, and can be safely positioned at any integer point along the rail. (A rack does not
block in a non-integer position and could accidentally move in either direction). The racks in a single
row need not be contiguous  there can be arbitrary (though integer) space between two successive
bookracks. A passage is formed at position k if there is no bookrack in the interval (k, k + 1) in any
row (somehow you dont like the idea of trying to find a more sophisticated passage in this maze.)

The passages formed in the library: at position 8 (the left figure) and at position 9 (the right figure).
Both attained at cost 3 by moving the bookracks marked with arrows.

Moving a rack requires a certain amount of efflort on your part: moving it in either direction costs
1. This cost does not depend on the distance of the shift, which can be explained by a well known fact
that static friction is considerably higher than kinetic friction. Still, you are here to borrow a book, not
to work out, so you would like to form a passage (at any position) with as little efflort as possible.

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input contains a positive integer Z  15,
denoting the number of test cases. Then Z test cases follow, each conforming to the format described
below.

Two space separated integers R and L (1  R, 1  L  106) are given in the first line of an input
instance. They denote the number of rows and the width of each and every row, respectively. Then
R lines with rows descriptions follow. Each such line starts with an integer ni, followed by ni integers
ai,1, ai,2, . . . ai,ni , all separated by single spaces. Number ai,j denotes either the width of a bookrack
when ai,j > 0 or a unit of empty space when ai,j = 0. Note that for any row i,


j ai,j equals L minus

the number of ai,j that are equal to zero. You may assume that n1+n2+   +nR  2  107. Moreover,
there will be at least one 0 in the description of each row, which means that creating a passage is
always possible.

## Output

```
For each test case, your program has to write an output conforming to the format described below.

In the first line, your program should output the minimum cost of making a passage through the
bookracks. In the second line, it should print out the increasing sequence of all the positions at which
a minimum cost passage can be formed.
