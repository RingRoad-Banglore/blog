## Input

```text

Prof. Tigris is the head of an archaeological team who is currently in charge of an excavation in a site
of ancient relics.

This site contains relics of a village where civilization once flourished. One night, examining a
writing record, you find some text meaningful to you. It reads as follows.

Our village is of glory and harmony. Our relationships are constructed in such a way that
everyone except the village headman has exactly one direct boss and nobody will be the
boss of himself, the boss of boss of himself, etc. Everyone expect the headman is considered
as his bosss subordinate. We call it relationship configuration. The village headman is at
level 0, his subordinates are at level 1, and his subordinates subordinates are at level 2,
etc. Our relationship configuration is harmonious because all people at same level have the
same number of subordinates. Therefore our relationship is . . .

The record ends here. Prof. Tigris now wonder how many different harmonious relationship con-
figurations can exist. He only cares about the holistic shape of configuration, so two configurations are
considered identical if and only if theres a bijection of n people that transforms one configuration into
another one.

Please see the illustrations below for explanation when n = 2 and n = 4.

The result might be very large, so you should take module operation with modules 109 + 7 before
print your answer.
