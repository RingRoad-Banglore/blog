title: Uva 13249  A Contest to Meet
---


## Input

```
A Contest to Meet (ACM) is a reality TV contest that sets three contestants at three random city
intersections. In order to win, the three contestants need all to meet at any intersection of the city as
fast as possible. The contestants are given communication devices to help them in sharing information
about the city (e.g., where the sun is, how far the mountains are, etc.).

It should be clear that the contestants may arrive at the intersections at different times, in which
case, the first to arrive can wait until the others arrive. Moreover, it is guaranteed that there is a path
between any pair of intersections.

From an estimated walking speed for each one of the three contestants, ACM wants to determine the
minimum time that a live TV broadcast should last to cover their journey regardless of the contestants
initial positions and the intersection they finally meet. You are hired to help ACM answer this question.

You may assume the following:

 Each contestant walks at a given estimated speed.

 The city is a collection of intersections in which some pairs are connected by bidirectional streets
that the contestants can use to traverse the city.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two blank-separated integer values N and S, indicating the
number of intersections and the number of streets in the city, respectively (1  N  100, 0  S  9000).
Then follow S lines, each one with three blank-separated integer values i, j, and d (0  i < N ,
0  j < N , i = j, 1  d  200), meaning that there is a street of length d meters connecting the i-th
and the j-th intersections. Note that intersections are indexed from 0 to N  1. You can assume that
there is at most one street connecting any pair of intersections and that the input lists a street exactly
once.

At the end of each test case there is one line with three blank-separated integer values sA, sB, sC
(50  sA, sB, sC  100), representing the walking speed of each of the three contestants, in meters per
minute.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a single line with an integer indicating the minimum number of minutes that
will pass before the three contestants can meet, if they start to walk immediately after the show starts.
Remember that the contestants can start at any random (unknown) intersection and can decide to meet
at any intersection: you need to account for the worst case scenario.

The answer should be given rounding decimals to the next integer (e.g., 2.9 minutes rounds up to
3 minutes and 3.2 minutes rounds up to 4 minutes).
