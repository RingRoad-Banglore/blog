title: Uva 00911  Multinomial Coefficients
---


```

One of the first formulas we were taught in high school mathematics is (a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab+ b2.
Later on, we learned that this is a special case of the expansion (a+ b)n, in which the coefficient of

akbnk is the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time. We never learned (at least I never
did . . . ) what happens if instead of a binomial a+ b we have a multinomial a+ b+ c+ . . .+ x.

Your task is to write a program that, given a multinomial m = a1 + a2 + . . .+ ak , k  1, computes
the coefficient of a given term in the expansion of mn, n  1. The given term is specified by a sequence
of k integer numbers z1, z2, . . . , zk, representing the powers of a1, a2, . . . , ak in the expansion. Note that
z1 + z2 + . . .+ zk = n. For example, the coefficient of ab

2c in (a+ b+ c)4 is 12.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them with three lines.
The first line contains a number representing the value of n. The second line contains a number

representing the value of k. The third line contains k numbers, representing the values of z1, z2, . . . , zk.
All test cases are such that k  100 and the computed coefficient is less than 231.

## Output

```
For each test case, write to the output one line.
This line contains one integer number representing the value of the coefficient of the term az11  a
