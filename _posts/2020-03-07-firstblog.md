Regional Programme for the Sustainable Management of the Coastal Zones* of the Countries of the Indian Ocean (PROGECO in French). 
This project ended in 2011. 

***Way ahead for India:***

For India, engagements with this region will become critical as the Navy begins to strengthen its presence 
under its mission based deployments. Engagements with the region, especially with the islands- given 
their geo-strategic location- could become key in supporting Indian naval presence as well as
furthering Delhiâ€™s Indian Ocean engagement.
