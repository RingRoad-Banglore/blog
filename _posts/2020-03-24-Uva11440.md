title: Uva 11440  Help Mr Tomisu
---


## Input

```
After wasting a significant time of his life in problem-setting, Mr. Tomisu is now searching for glory: A
glory that will make him famous like Goldbach and rich like Bill Gates :). And he has chosen the field
of Number Theory as his prime interest. His creator did not make him very bright and so he needs
your help to solve an elementary problem, using which he will begin his pursuit for glory!

Tomisu has come to know that finding out numbers having large prime factors are very important
in cryptography. Given two integers N and M , he aims to count the number of integers X between 2
and N ! (factorial N), having the property that all prime factors of X are greater than M .
```

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 500 lines of inputs. Each line contains two integers N (1 < N <
10000001) and M (1  M  N and N M  100000). Input is terminated by a line containing two
zeroes. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the value T%100000007 (Modulo
100000007 value of T ). Here T is the total number of numbers between 1 and N ! (factorial N) which
have prime factors greater than M .

```

## Sample Output

```
100 10
100 20
10000 9000
0 0

```
