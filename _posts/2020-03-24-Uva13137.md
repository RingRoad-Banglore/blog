## Input

```
Ailin is learning algorithms on matrices, and now she have an array of integers and she wonders what
is the maximum submatrix that meets the following property:

ai,j = ai1,j + 1 (0 < i < p, 0  j < q)
ai,j = ai,j1 + 1 (0  i < p, 0 < j < q)

Where p, q are the dimensions of the submatrix (1  p  n, 1  q  m) and n, m are the dimensions
of the matrix (1  n,m  1000). A submatrix is larger than another if the number of cells of the first
is greater than the number of cells in the second.
```

## Output

```
Input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n and m (1  n,m  1000),
the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix. The following n lines contain m numbers
each, these are the values of the matrix ai,j (1  ai,j  1000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, you have to print in one line the number of elements of the maximum submatrix
which meets the above described property.

```

## Sample Output

```
4 7
3 4 5 6 7 8 9
5 4 2 7 8 9 10
6 3 1 8 9 11 11
7 4 2 9 11 10 12
2 2
4 4
4 4
