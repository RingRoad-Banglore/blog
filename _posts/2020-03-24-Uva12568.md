title: Uva 12568  Optimizing Key Signature

```
A key signature is not the same as a key; key signatures are merely notational devices.
They are convenient principally for diatonic or tonal music. Some pieces that change key
(modulate) insert a new key signature on the staff partway, while others use accidentals:
natural signs to neutralize the key signature and other sharps or flats for the new key.

 Wikipedia

You see, key signatures can be really confusing at times. For example, consider the follow score, whose
key signature is 0 sharp/flat (which usually indicates C major/A minor):

(In ASCII format: B #C #D E #F #G #A B)

Its more reasonable to rewrite the score in the key signature 5 sharp (which usually indicates B
major/g# minor):

(In ASCII format: B C D E F G A B)

This is more natural because no accidentals (i.e. sharp/flat/natural sign) exist.

Given a music piece with a key signature, your task is the find the best key signature that minimizes
the number of accidentals. Under that condition, the number of sharps/flats in the key signature should
be minimized. Note that you CANNOT change the staff position of any note. For example, you cant
change #G to bA even if this can save accidentals.

To simplify this problem, we only consider sharp, flat and natural accidentals (no double accidentals
or half-sharps etc), and all the notes are in the same octave. No notes will be tied to the same note
across the barline.

In your optimized score, no courtesy or cautionary accidental should be placed by a note whose pitch
is, strictly speaking, already given by the key signature. However, in the original piece, such accidentals
might exist to make peoples life easier, because even musicians may sometimes get confused when
reading the score at speed.

Important notes:

 Dont forget the effect of accidental last until the end of the measure. For example, the measure
bA A A A contains only one accidental, but the last three notes are also affected, so all four notes
are of the same pitch.

 The effect of the accidental has to be understood in relation to the natural meaning of the
notes staff position, so in the key signature with 3 sharps, a bG note is actually TWO semitones
lower than G (which is actually #G, thanks to the key signature).

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case begins with the initial
key signature formatted as m#/b, that means the key signature has m sharps/flats (0  m  7).
If m = 0, then the #/b part is omitted. The next line contains the notes, separated by barlines |
and ending with a double barline ||. Consecutive notes and barlines are separated by a single space.
Each note is formatted as two characters, where the first is either empty or one of #(sharp), b(flat)
or n(natural), the second character is one of C,D,E,F,G,A,B (upper-case). There will be at most 10
measures and 100 notes in each score.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the minimum number of accidentals in the first line, and then the best key
signatures having the least number of sharps/flats, in the same format as the input. Key signatures
should be sorted lexicographically.

Print a blank line after each test case.

Appendix:

Staff. In standard Western musical notation, the staff, or stave, is a set of five horizontal lines
and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch. You can see in the web page:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_%28music%29.

Key signature. A key signature is a series of sharp or flat symbols placed on the staff, designating
notes that are to be consistently played one semitone higher or lower than the equivalent natural notes
unless otherwise altered with an accidental... See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature.

Accidentals. An accidental is a note
whose pitch (or pitch class) is not a mem-
ber of a scale or mode indicated by the
most recently applied key signature... In
most cases, a sharp raises the pitch of a
note one semitone while a flat lowers it
a semitone. A natural is used to cancel
the effect of a flat or sharp. This sys-
tem of accidentals operates in conjunction
with the key signature, whose effect contin-
ues throughout an entire piece, unless can-
celed by another key signature. An acci-
dental can also be used to cancel or re-
instate the flats or sharps of the key sig-
nature...accidentals have been understood to
continue for the remainder of the mea-
sure in which they occur, so that a sub-
sequent note on the same staff position
is still affected by that accidental, unless
marked as an accidental on its own... See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_%28music%29
