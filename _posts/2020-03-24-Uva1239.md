title: Uva 01239  Greatest KPalindrome Substring
---


## Input

```

Palindrome is a string that can be read in the same way in either forward or backward direction. For
example: ABBA is a palindrome, MOM is also a palindrome, but MATE is not. A non-palindrome
string can be transformed into a palindrome by changing some of its characters. We call a string a
k-palindrome if it can be turned into a palindrome by changing at most k characters. By this definition,
a regular palindrome string is 0-palindrome.

Given a string S of length N that contains only lowercase characters (a. . .z) and an integer k,
find the longest substring of S which is k-palindrome.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T , the number of test cases to follow. Each case consists
of string S (1  |S|  1000) and integer K (0  K  |S|). String S consists of lowercase characters
(a . . . z) only. |S| denotes the length of string S.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print in a single line: the length of the longest substring of S which is k-palindrome.

```

## Sample Output

```
3

abba 0

mate 1

zabcddcbxy 1

```
