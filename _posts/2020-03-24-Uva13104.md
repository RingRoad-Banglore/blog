title: Uva 13104  Tobby and Prime Sum
---


```
Tobby has learned to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number X, but this is very easy for him.
Lately he has been studying about prime numbers and he has found a more challenging question:

How many integer numbers in the range from L to R (inclusive) exist such that the sum of
their digits is a prime number?.

Tobby is an smart puppy but he can only count to 100, can you help him to solve this problem?
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases and must be read until EOF. The first line of each test case
contains two integers L and R (1  L  R  10500).

```

## Output

```
For each test case the output consists of one number X indicating how many numbers in the range
L, R meet the property previously mentioned. Because this amount can be very large you also should
print the answer modulo 109 + 7.

```

## Sample Input

```
1 10
20 46

```

## Sample Output

```
4
11
```
