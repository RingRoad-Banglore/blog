title: Uva 10273  Eat or not to Eat?
---


## Input

```text
A young farmer has N cows, but they produced really really a
very very small amount of milk. John cannot live on the milk
they made, so hes planning to eat some of the worst cows to
get rid of hunger. Each day, John chooses the cow that produces
the LEAST amount of milk on that day and eat them. If there
are more than one cow with minimal milk, John will be puzzled
and will not eat any of them (Yeah! Thats GREAT!!).

The i-th cow has a cycle of production Ti. That means, if it
produces L unit milk on one day, it will also produce L unit after
Ti days  If it will not be eaten during these day :-). Though
John is not a clever man, he doubts whether the cows will be
eventually eaten up, so he asks for your help. Dont forget that
he will offer you some nice beef for that!
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains a single integer T , indicating
the number of test cases (1  T  50). Each test case begins with an integer N (1  N  1000), the
number of cows. In the following N lines, each line contains an integer Ti (1  Ti  10), indicating the
cycle of the i-th cow, then Ti integers Mj (0  Mj  250) follow, indicating the amount of milk it can
produce on the j-th day.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input, print a single line containing two integers C, D, indicating the number
of cows that will NOT be eaten, and the number of days passed when the last cow is eaten. If no cow
is eaten, the second number should be 0.
