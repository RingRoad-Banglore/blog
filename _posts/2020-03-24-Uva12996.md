title: Uva 12996  Ultimate Mango Challenge
---


## Input

```
Rajshahi is one of the oldest cities in
Bangladesh. Its land is mother of one of
the most delicious fruits in the world, Mango.
You can find mango in various parts of the
world, but the mango from Rajshahi is famous
worldwide for its unique and delicious taste.
People are so obsessed with these mangoes
that sometimes they hear  
in japanese shop (well . . . they actually say
irasshaimasewhich means welcome). The va-
riety of mangoes that grows around Rajshahi is
truly overwhelming. As an outsider, it might
be really surprising to see people of Rajshahi
eating mangoes (or food prepared from man-
goes) three times a day. I was surprised first
time to see such enthusiasm. But I was not ready to face what was coming next.

One of my relative from Rajshahi challenged me to eat mangoes like they do. When I tried to get
out of it I was mocked in various ways, and was called a coward. So I decided to give it a shot. But as
a CSE major, I wanted to know beforehand whether I am going to pass or fail the challenge. It will be
really easy to find out using a program. But I cant use laptop keyboard and only you can help me out
from this big trouble.
```

## Output

```

types of mangoes and L (0  L  20), my limit of eating maximum number of mangoes at one meal.
Next line contains N integers, all of them will be less than 10. Each of these integers indicates number
of mangoes of each kind in the plate in front of me. Next line will contain N integers, all of them less
than 10. Each of these integers indicates my limit of eating a particular type of mango. I need to finish
every mango in the plate to win the challenge. Total number of mangoes I eat cannot exceed my limit
L. Also number of a particular type mangoes eaten should also not exceed the limit for that particular
type.

```
