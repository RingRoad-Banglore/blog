title: Uva 11028  Sum of Product
---


```
Given n, there can be n! circular arrangement of the numbers 0 to n 1.

Lets represent every permutation as P1 P2 P3 . . . Pn!
SOP (Pk) = sum of product of every two contiguous numbers in Pk.
Consider an example where n = 4 and Pk = (1 3 2 0), therefore SOP (Pk) = 13+32+20+01 = 9.
You have to find out the number of distinct values of SOP (Pk) for k = 1 to n!.
For n = 3,

Pk Permutation SOP (Pk)
P1 0 1 2 2
P2 0 2 1 2
P3 1 0 2 2
P4 1 2 0 2
P5 2 0 1 2
P6 2 1 0 2

So, for n = 3, there is only 1 distinct value of SOP (Pk).
```

## Input

```
There will be multiple test cases. Each case consists of a line containing a positive integer n (1 < n  20).
The last line of input file contains a single 0 that doesnt need to be processed. The total number of
test cases will be at most 30.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the case number followed by the number of distinct SOPs.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
4
6
0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case #1: 1
Case #2: 3
Case #3: 21
```
