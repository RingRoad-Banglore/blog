title: Uva 12122  Infinite Matrix
---


```
You are given a Vector V and Matrix M. V has n variables V1, V2, , Vn. M is lower triangular matrix
with n rows numbered from 1 to n. Row i has i 1 column. You can calculate an infinite matrix R by
the following equation.

Ri,j =

{
(Ri1,j +

j1
k=1 i

Mj,k Ri,k)%m if i > 1
Vj if i = 1

The matrix R has n columns and infinite rows. Now consider about a function Sp,a,b,c,d. You can
calculate this by the following equation.

Sp,a,b,c,d =


 c

i=0

d
j=0

(i+ 1)p Ri+a,j+b


%m

For our problem the value of m is 1000000007. This is a prime number. Your task is to given V
and M you have to calculate Sp,a,b,c,d.
```

## Input

```
First line contains T (1  T  5) the number of test cases. Each test case contains multiple number of
lines.

Line 1 contains 1 integer n (1  n  200). Line 2 to Line n+ 1 contains the information about V
and M.

Among these lines Line i+ 1 contains i integers.
First integer is the value of Vi (1  Vi  200). Subsequent integers are M1,i, M2,i, M3,i, , Mi1,i

in order. (0  Mi,j < min(10, j  i)).
Line n + 2 contains an integer q (1  q  1000) the number of queries. Each of the next q lines

contains 5 integers p (0  p  9), a (1  a  1015), b (1  b  n), c (0  c  1015), d (0  d  n b)
separated by a single space.

```

## Output

```
For each query output a single integer denoting the value Sp,a,b,c,d. Output a blank lines after each test
case.
