title: Uva 11792  Krochanska is Here!

## Input

```text

If you do a bit of espionage, you will discover
here that Cirilo Krochanska is...

This is a problem about spies and counter-spies in
the old days of the Iron Curtain. CONTROL, the
secret intelligence agency of the free world, must fight
against KAOS, the international organization of evil.

CONTROL agents 82 through 85 have all died
attempting to deliver the payroll for Controls free-
lance agents located behind the Iron Curtain. They
all were killed by the mysterious and sinister KAOS
agent Cirilo Krochanska, while traveling aboard the
Orient Express. You are Maxwell Smart, agent 86,
and you must board the train, make contact with
agent B-12, give him the encrypted message tnih se-
vig cilc thgir, deliver the payroll, and avoid becom-
ing Krochanskas fifth victim!

But, where is Krochanska? We know he always
travel by train; he is in some important train station
in Europe, and is ready to reach immediately any destination where he is required.

The railway network of Europe consists of a number of lines. Each line goes between two different
stations; and there are also some intermediate stations uniformly distributed in each line. For example,
if we enumerate the stations from 1 to 13, we can have the following three lines:

 Line 1. 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7.

 Line 2. 8 - 9 - 4 - 10 - 13.

 Line 3. 11 - 2 - 12 - 9 - 6 - 7.

Trains travel in both directions of the lines. The time to travel from a station to the following
(or the previous) station of the line is always 2 hours. As you can observe, some stations are used by
different lines we call them the important stations, while other stations are only used by one line
the secondary stations.

We believe Krochanska is situated in an important station where he can travel faster to any other
station. In particular, he tries to minimize the average of the minimum times from his station to the
rest of important stations. You can assume that there is no loss of time to switch from one line to
another at a station.

You have to find out where Cirilo Krochanska is.

## Output

```text
The input will contain several test cases. The first line indicates the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains two integers: N and S. N is the total number of existing
stations, and S is the number of lines. Stations are numbered from 1 to N ; N is not greater than 10000;
and S is not greater than 100. Next, we have S lines, one for each train line. These lines consist of a
list of stations, separated by blank spaces, ending with a 0.

There will be between 1 and 100 important stations, inclusive. There is always a path between any
pair of stations.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, you have to output the number of the resulting station, in the following format:

Krochanska is in: X

where X is the number of the station. If there are more than one important station with the minimum
distance, then you have to output the one with the smallest number.
