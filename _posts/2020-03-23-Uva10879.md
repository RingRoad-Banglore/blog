10879 Code Refactoring
“Harry, my dream is a code waiting to be
broken. Break the code, solve the crime.”

Agent Cooper

Several algorithms in modern cryptography are based on the fact that factoring large numbers is
difficult. Alicia and Bobby know this, so they have decided to design their own encryption scheme
based on factoring. Their algorithm depends on a secret code, K, that Alicia sends to Bobby before
sending him an encrypted message. After listening carefully to Alicia’s description, Yvette says, “But
if I can intercept K and factor it into two positive integers, A and B, I would break your encryption
scheme! And the K values you use are at most 10,000,000. Hey, this is so easy; I can even factor it
twice, into two different pairs of integers!”

## Input
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (at most 25000). N test cases follow. Each one
contains the code, K, on a line by itself.

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing ‘Case #x: K = A * B = C * D’, where A, B, C and
D are different positive integers larger than 1. A solution will always exist.

## Sample Input
<p>3</p><p>120</p><p>210</p><p>10000000</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>Case #1: 120 = 12 * 10 = 6 * 20</p><p>Case #2: 210 = 7 * 30 = 70 * 3</p><p>Case #3: 10000000 = 10 * 1000000 = 100 * 100000</p>
