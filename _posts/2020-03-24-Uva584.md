History

Bowling has been traced to articles found in the tomb of an Egyptian child buried in 5200 BC. The
primitive implements included nine pieces of stone at which a stone ball was rolled, the ball having
first to roll through an archway made of three pieces of marble.

Another ancient discovery was the Polynesian game of ula maika, which also used pins and balls of
stone. The stones were to be rolled at targets 60 feet away, a distance which is still one of the basic
regulations of tenpins.

Bowling at tenpins probably originated in Germany, not as a sport but as a religious ceremony.
Martin Luther is credited with settling on nine as the ideal number of pins.

Tracing history reveals the game moved through Europe, the Scandinavian countries and finally
to the United States, where the earliest known reference to bowling at pins in America was made by
author Washington Irving about 1818 in Rip Van Winkle.

Although the game was being played throughout the world, rules were different almost everywhere,
and even basic equipment was not the same. In fact, why and when the 10th pin was added from the
European game of ninepins to the American game of tenpins is still a mystery.
Rules

A single bowling game consists of ten frames. The object in each frame is to roll a ball at ten
bowling pins arranged in an equilateral triangle and to knock down as many pins as possible.

For each frame, a bowler is allowed a maximum of two rolls to knock down all ten pins. If the
bowler knocks them all down on the first attempt, the frame is scored as a strike. If the bowler does
not knock them down on the first attempt in the frame the bowler is allowed a second attempt to knock
down the remaining pins. If the bowler succeeds in knocking the rest of the pins down in the second
attempt, the frame is scored as a spare.

The score for a bowling game consists of sum of the scores for each frame. The score for each
frame is the total number of pins knocked down in the frame, plus bonuses for strikes and spares. In
particular, if a bowler scores a strike in a particular frame, the score for that frame is ten plus the sum
of the next two rolls. If a bowler scores a spare in a particular frame, the score for that frame is ten plus
the score of the next roll. If a bowler scores a strike in the tenth (final) frame, the bowler is allowed
two more rolls. Similarly, a bowler scoring a spare in the tenth frame is allowed one more roll.

The maximum possible score in a game of bowling (strikes in all ten frames plus two extra strikes
for the tenth frame strike) is 300.
