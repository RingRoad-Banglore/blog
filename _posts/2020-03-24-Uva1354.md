## Input

```

There is a mysterious planet called Yaen, whose space is 2-dimensional. There are many beautiful
stones on the planet, and the Yaen people love to collect them. They bring the stones back home and
make nice mobile arts of them to decorate their 2-dimensional living rooms.

In their 2-dimensional world, a mobile is defined recursively as follows:

 a stone hung by a string, or

 a rod of length 1 with two sub-mobiles at both ends; the rod is hung
by a string at the center of gravity of sub-mobiles. When the weights
of the sub-mobiles are n and m, and their distances from the center of
gravity are a and b respectively, the equation n a = m b holds.

For example, if you got three stones with weights 1, 1, and 2, here are some possible mobiles and
their widths:

Given the weights of stones and the width of the room, your task is to design the widest possible
mobile satisfying both of the following conditions.

 It uses all the stones.

 Its width is less than the width of the room.

You should ignore the widths of stones.
In some cases two sub-mobiles hung from both ends of a rod might

overlap (see the figure on the right). Such mobiles are acceptable. The
width of the example is (1/3) + 1 + (1/4).
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input gives the number of datasets. Then the specified number of datasets follow.
A dataset has the following format.

r
s
w1
...
ws

r is a decimal fraction representing the width of the room, which satisfies 0 < r < 10. s is the number
of the stones. You may assume 1  s  6. wi is the weight of the i-th stone, which is an integer. You
may assume 1  wi  1000.

You can assume that no mobiles whose widths are between r0.00001 and r+0.00001 can be made
of given stones.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset in the input, one line containing a decimal fraction should be output. The decimal
fraction should give the width of the widest possible mobile as defined above. An output line should
not contain extra characters such as spaces.

In case there is no mobile which satisfies the requirement, answer -1 instead.
The answer should not have an error greater than 0.00000001. You may output any numb er of

digits after the decimal point, provided that the ab ove accuracy condition is satisfied.
