title: Uva 13253  Rational Coins

## Input

```
Ratioland is a beautiful and highly rational country where the official currency is the Ration and
the currency symbol is R. Coins are available in denominations of 1

q
R, for each natural number

q = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . . Some years ago, the Royal Bank of Ratioland promoted a law to define the properties
of all coins: each coin of denomination 1

q
R had to be a cylinder made of gold with a thickness of

0.1 inches, radius of 1
2q2 inches, and labeled with the fraction representing the magnificent Rational

Number 1
q
.

Coins of denomination 1
q
R, for values of q = 1, 2, 3, 4.

In order to celebrate the beauty of its currency, the Royal Bank of Ratioland wants to display some
coins in its museum. For this purpose, it has designed a frame with a width of 2 inches, a height
of 1 inch, and a thickness of 0.1 inches. In this frame, two coins of denomination 1

1
R fit exactly.

Moreover, many other coins can be placed in the frame. Raphaello, a renowned and rational artist born
in Ratioland, was invited by the bank manager to design the layout to place the coins in the frame.
After a week of hard work, Raphaello invented a rational procedure to place the coins inside the frame
without any overlapping:

 Embed the frame in a Cartesian coordinate system, locating its corners at

)
,(

.

 Since it is possible to place only two coins of denomination 1
1
R, these coins are to be placed with

their centers at
(
0, 1

2

)
and

(
1, 1

)
, respectively.

 For each natural number q > 1, and each natural value p such that 0 < p
q
< 1 and p

q
is an

irreducible fraction, a coin of denomination 1
q
R is to be placed with center at

(

, 1
2q2

)
.

All coins are placed tangent to the horizontal axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. In order
avoid confusion, Raphaello decided to name the coin of denomination 1

q
R with center at

(
p
q
, 1
2q2

)
as

M(p/q). For example:

 M(0/1) is the coin of denomination 1
1
R with center at

(
0, 1

)
;

 M(1/1) is the coin of denomination 1
1
R with center at

(
1, 1

2

)
; and

 M(1/2) is the coin of denomination 1
2
R with center at

(
1

, 1

)
.

Raphaello wants to know the first n coins that touch the coin M(p/q) inside the frame when sorting
all these coins by decreasing order of radius (i.e., by increasing order of q). If two coins share the same
radius, he wants them sorted by increasing order of x coordinates (i.e., by increasing order of p).
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is described by a line containing three blank-
separated integers p, q, and n (0  p

q
 1, 1  q  106, 1  n  103), with p

q
an irreducible fraction.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a single line with the n blank-separated names of the first n coins that touch
M(p/q) in the frame. The list of coins must be printed in the order previously described.
