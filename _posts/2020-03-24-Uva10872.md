title: Uva 10872  How Many Triangles?
---


## Input

```text
A triangle is a polygon with three sides and a positive area (greater than zero). Two different triangles
can have the same perimeter. For example the two different triangles (3, 4, 6) and (3, 5, 5) has the
same perimeter 13. In this problem you will be given an integer perimeter. Your task is to determine
how many different triangles there are having this perimeter, such that the length of all the sides of the
triangle are also integers. Two triangles are same if the lengths of three sides of a triangle are equal to
the length of three sides of the other triangle.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains less than 2001 lines of inputs. Each line contains a positive integer N (N 
231  1) that indicates the perimeter of a triangle. Input is terminated by a line containing a single
zero. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output, which contains the serial of output as shown in the
output for sample input followed by an integer T . Here T denotes the number different triangles with
perimeter N . You can safely assume that T will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
