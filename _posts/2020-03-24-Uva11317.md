title: Uva 11317  GCD + LCM
---


## Input

```text
Given the value of N , you will have to find the number of digits in G and L in base googol (10100). The
definition of G and L are given below:

G =

N1
i=1

N
j=i+1

GCD(i, j) L =

N1
i=1

N
j=i+1

LCM(i, j)

If you are not accustomed with the symbol


, then for your kind information we give an example:

41
i=1

4
j=i+1

GCD(i, j) = GCD(1, 2) GCD(1, 3) GCD(1, 4) GCD(2, 3) GCD(2, 4) GCD(3, 4)

Here GCD(i, j) means the greatest common divisor of integer i and integer j, and LCM(i, j) means
the Least Common Multiplicand of integer i and integer j.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 100 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer N (1 < N < 1000001).
Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by
two integers DG and DL. Here DG is the number of digits in G when written in base googol and DL
is the number of digits in L when written in base googol. Dont even think of submitting a brute force
solution: It will probably take more than 2 years for the largest possible input. Look at the output for
sample input for format details.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10
100
20000
0

```
