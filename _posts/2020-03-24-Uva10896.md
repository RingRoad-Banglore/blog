title: Uva 10896  Known Plaintext Attack

## Input

```
One of the earliest encrypting systems is attributed to Julius Caesar: if the letter to be encrypted is
the m-th letter in the alphabet, replace it with the (m + k)-th where k is some fixed integer. Caesar
used k = 3, or a  d, as the key to the encryption. That is, a would be encrypted to d, b would
be e, and so on until z would be c. For example, for a  k, the sentence this is a test
would become drsc sc k docd.

Now you have an encrypted sentence, and you know a decrypted word in that sentence. Your task
is to find all the possible keys to the encryption.
```

## Output

```
The input starts with a line containing a number, n, followed by n sets of encrypted sentence/decrypted
word pairs. Each set has two lines, the first line is the encrypted sentence which contains only words
separated by a space with no punctuation, the second line contains a word which is one of the decrypted
word of the sentence above it. All words are in lowercase letters. You may assume a word is at most
16 characters long, and a line has no more than 70 characters.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output has n lines of character(s), corresponding to the n sets of encrypted sentence/decrypted
word pairs.

The line consists of lowercase letter(s) of possible key(s). That is, if the plaintext a is encrypted
to x, then x would be in the line.

Each line of characters must be sorted in alphabetical order.
