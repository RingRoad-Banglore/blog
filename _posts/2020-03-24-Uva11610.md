title: Uva 11610  Reverse Prime
---


```
There are a few 7 digit positive numbers whose reverse number is a prime number and less than 106. For
example: 1000070, 1000090 and 1000240 are first few reverse prime numbers because all of the numbers
are 7 digit numbers whose reverse number is a prime number and less than 106. You have to find out
all the 7 digit reverse prime numbers and also its number of prime factors. Prime factors of a positive
integer are the prime numbers that divide into that integer exactly, without leaving a remainder. For
example, prime factors of 24 are 2, 2, 2 and 3.
```

## Input

```
In this problem, youll encounter 2 types of input:

Query: This type of input will be formatted like this  q i.

Deletion: This type of input will be formatted like this d reverse_prime.

It is guaranteed that i will be a valid index and reverse_prime will be a valid 7 digit reverse prime
number. It is also guaranteed that no two reverse_prime will be same.

There will be at most 71000 query lines and 3500 deletion lines in the data set. The program will
terminated by EOF.

```

## Output

```
For Query type input, you have to calculate the cumulative summation of the number of prime factors
of reverse prime numbers from 0-th to i-th index.

For Deletion type input, you have to delete reverse_prime from the set and update your summation.
No output is required in such cases.
