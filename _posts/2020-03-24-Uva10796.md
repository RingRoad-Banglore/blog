title: Uva 10796  Right Hand Rule
---


```
Mazes are one of the most popular forms of puzzles. The numerous branches and dead ends of intricately
constructed mazes can put the patience and problem-solving skill of the solver to a challenging test.
But even for a budding programmer, writing a computer program that explores a maze is a trivial task.
However, the addition of a rather not so intelligent agent to the maze can really make it delicate.

There are many strategies that one can employ while exploring a maze. Marking off the cells, and
carrying a ball of thread are two such strategies. There is yet another strategy which we call the Right
Hand Rule. This rule suggests that the solver keeps the right hand in constant contact with one of the
walls as he proceeds. This method guarantees that if there is an exit, the solver will be able to reach
it, if it is reachable from the cell he started. Otherwise, it would take him through every cell that is
reachable from his starting cell. This may not be the best idea when one would want to go from a cell
to another cell in the maze. But if we would like to put a programmed agent to keep exploring the
maze, this rule can be quite useful.

In this problem, we have one such programmed agent, called
Agent K, that is continuously exploring a rectangular maze.
Agent K can move in four directions, UP, DOWN, LEFT and
RIGHT, but cannot move through the walls. K has its right
hand in constant contact with the wall. It goes through the cells
of the maze taking one unit time to make a move. It does not
take any time to make a turn in the same cell, though. It may
happen that K finds an exit from the maze and falls out. But
that does not end Ks exploration. The moment it falls out, it is
re-spawned in the cell from where its journey began.

The accompanying picture illustrates this scenario. In a 10
10 rectangular maze, Agent K is placed in cell (9,3) facing UP.
The impermeable walls are gray, and the passable cells are white.
K follows the right hand rule and moves along the path in the

red line. At time 42, K is at cell (3,0)  so at time 43, K is supposed to be out of the maze. But instead
of falling out, K reappears at cell (9,2) at time 43. For some mazes it may happen that K never finds
an exit. In those cases, K will have a closed path, which in which it would loop forever.

Now your task is to find the shortest path from a given starting
cell to a designated destination cell. You must avoid Agent K
at all cost. You may not be in the same cell as K at the same
time as him, and you may not walk to a cell if K is walking from
that cell to your cell (then you would be caught in the corridor
if you and K approach each other from opposite direction). You
can move in the same four directions as K, and you both make
your moves simultaneously. Additionally, you may choose to not
move, and wait one unit of time for agent K to do its next move.

Let us illustrate this scenario in the same sample maze. If you
are to go from cell (1,1) to cell (9,2) in shortest possible time, one
approach could be waiting at cell (1,1) till time 10 and then start
moving along the path shown in blue. There are of course, other

ways to go from (1,1) to (9,2) but the minimum possible time required remains to be 21. You only need
to compute the minimum time, not the path.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of the input file contains a single integer, T
(1  T  25) indicating the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each
of the test case would give you the number of rows, R (1  R  20) and the number of columns, C
(1  C  20) of the maze. In the next line you would find three pairs of numbers and a letter. The
pairs are given in row, column format representing your starting cell, destination cell and agent Ks
starting cell respectively. The letter at the end of this line can be U, D, L, or R giving you the
direction K is facing. So 1 1 9 2 9 2 U would essentially mean that you are at cell (1,1), you need
to go to cell (9,2), and agent K is at cell (9,2) and is facing UP. It is guaranteed that there will be a
wall to the right hand side of agent K. In the next R lines, the maze description is given. A # in a
cell represents an impermeable wall, whereas a . would mean that the cell is passable. Cell (0,0) is
the upper left corner of the maze.

```

## Output

```
The output for each test case starts with the test case number in the format Maze x:  where
1  x  T . Then there would be exactly one integer denoting the minimum unit time required for you
to reach the destined cell; if it is impossible to reach the destined cell, output -1 instead.
