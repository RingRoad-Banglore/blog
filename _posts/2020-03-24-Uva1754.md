```

Pixels in a digital picture can be represented with three integers in the range 0 to 255 that indicate
the intensity of the red, green, and blue colors. To compress an image or to create an artistic effect,
many photo-editing tools include a posterize operation which works as follows. Each color channel
is examined separately; this problem focuses only on the red channel. Rather than allow all integers
from 0 to 255 for the red channel, a posterized image allows at most k integers from this range. Each
pixels original red intensity is replaced with the nearest of the allowed integers. The photo-editing tool
selects a set of k integers that minimizes the sum of the squared errors introduced across all pixels in
the original image. If there are n pixels that have original red values r1, . . . , rn , and k allowed integers
v1, . . . , vk , the sum of squared errors is defined as

n
i=1

min
1jk

(rivj)2.

Your task is to compute the minimum achievable sum of squared errors, given parameter k and a
description of the red intensities of an images pixels.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line of the input contains two integers d (1  d  256), the number of distinct red values

that occur in the original image, and k (1  k  d), the number of distinct red values allowed in the
posterized image. The remaining d lines indicate the number of pixels of the image having various red
values. Each such line contains two integers r (0  r  255) and p (1  p  226), where r is a red
intensity value and p is the number of pixels having red intensity r. Those d lines are given in increasing
order of red value.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, on a line by itself, display the sum of the squared errors for an optimally chosen set
of k allowed integer values.
