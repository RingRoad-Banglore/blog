title: Uva 12981  Secret Master Plan
---


```
Master Mind KongMing gave Fei Zhang a secret master plan stashed in a pocket. The plan instructs
how to deploy soldiers on the four corners of the city wall. Unfortunately, when Fei opened the pocket
he found there are only four numbers written in dots on a piece of sheet. The numbers form a 2  2
matrix, but Fei didnt know the correct direction to hold the sheet. What a pity!

Given two secret master plans. The first one is the masters original plan. The second one is the
plan opened by Fei. As KongMing had many pockets to hand out, he might give Fei the wrong pocket.
Determine if Fei receives the right pocket.
```
