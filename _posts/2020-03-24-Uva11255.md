```
Once upon a time, three girls  Winnie, Grace and Bonnie  owned a large number of pearls. However,
each of them only had a single color of pearls. Winnie had white pearls, Grace had grey pearls and
Bonnie had black pearls. One day, after a long discussion, they decided to make necklaces using the
pearls. They are interested in knowing how many patterns can be formed using a certain number of
pearls of each color, and have asked you to solve this problem for them.

Note that rotating or flipping over a necklace cannot produce a different kind of necklace. i.e. The
following figure shows three equivalent necklaces.

The following figure shows all possible necklaces formed by 3 white pearls, 2 grey pearls and 1 black
pearl.
