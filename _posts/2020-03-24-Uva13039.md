title: Uva 13039  Fibonacci Triangle
---


## Input

```
Given some sticks with length equal to a Fibonacci number, for example 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. You have
to make triangle with positive area using these sticks. One stick can be used at most once (for making
only one triangle). N -th Fibonacci number is F (N).

F (1) = 2
F (2) = 3
F (n) = F (n 1) + F (n 2) for n  3
```

## Output

```
Given T  100 denoting test cases. Each case starts with a positive integer n  1000. Then, there will
be n non-negative integers, i-th integer denote the number of sticks with side length F (i).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case you have to print an integer in a line denoting the maximum number of triangles (with
positive area) you can form using these sticks. The number is guaranteed to be less than 108.

## Sample Output

```
