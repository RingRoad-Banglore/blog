title: Uva 10789  Prime Frequency
---


## Input

```text
Given a string containing only alpha-numerals (0-9, A-Z
and a-z) you have to count the frequency (the number of
times the character is present) of all the characters and
report only those characters whose frequency is a prime
number. A prime number is a number, which is divisible
by exactly two different integers. Some examples of prime
numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 etc.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input is an integer T (0 < T < 201)
that indicates how many sets of inputs are there. Each of
the next T lines contains a single set of input.

The input of each test set is a string consisting alpha-numerals only. The length of this string is
positive and less than 2001.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by the
characters whose frequency in the input string is a prime number. These characters are to be sorted in
lexicographically ascending order. Here lexicographically ascending means ascending in terms of the
ASCII values. Look at the output for sample input for details. If none of the character frequency is a
prime number, you should print empty (without the quotes) instead.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
ABCC
AABBBBDDDDD
ABCDFFFF

```
