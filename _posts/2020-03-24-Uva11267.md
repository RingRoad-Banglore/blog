## Input

```
As some other websites, Hire-a-Coder is a new website that works as an agent between custom software
buyers and freelance software developers. According to the Hire-a-Coder business model, a number
of clients are registered in the system. Some of them are software buyers. They post custom software
projects on the site. Then the coders bid on the projects and each of the projects is assigned to a single
particular coder after the biddings and dealings. Any buyer may have more than one open project at a
time. Similarly any coder can take up more than a single project at any time. But no coder is allowed
to take multiple projects from the same buyer at a time. The site works as a medium in the total
procedure. Now, if a coder successfully completes his assigned project and the buyer accepts his work,
Hire-a-Coder gets some commission for that. But if the coder fails to complete a project or satisfy the
client with his work, the company has to pay a penalty to the buyer thus suffering a loss.

Recently it is found out that there are a number of fake coders that take up a project but never
finish their work eventually causing the company a good amount of loss. So, they need someone to
advise them which of the possible project assignments are to make and which are to avoid in order to
minimize their loss.

Assume, all the registered clients of the company are denoted by a unique positive integer number
between 1 and N . By the help of a great fortune-teller, they have already tabulated the future of
assigning all possible buyer-coder pairs. You can assume that assigning any project from a particular
buyer to a particular coder has the same future. In their tabulation, if a coder fails to do a project from
a buyer, a positive integer value is assigned to this particular buyer-coder pair. The value indicates the
amount of loss the company is going to suffer if they pair-up these two clients. On the other hand, in
case of a successful completion of a project from a buyer-coder pair, a negative integer value is assigned
to this pair which denotes negative loss i.e. amount of profit.

You are assured that, every single individual in the community has a communication link to all
other people in this community, not necessarily through direct acquaintance. The link may well be via
one or more other people. Also note that, if A knows B then B always knows A.

Theres one more problem. You have the pairing information for all those N people but you dont
know which of them are buyers and which of them are coders. But you know that, all the registered
clients are either a buyer or a coder and theres no one who is a buyer and a coder simultaneously. If
the data for any test case violates this assumption, print Invalid data, Idiot! and stop processing
that case further.

Now, bearing all these factors in mind, you are to select a subset of the possible pairings so that
if the company makes strictly those assignments, their loss is minimum possible. Also, you have to
choose the subset so that every single person still has a direct / indirect communication link to all other
people.
```

## Output

```
Every test case starts with a single positive integer N (2  N  200) which is the number of registered
clients. The second line has another positive integer E (1  Nle11000), the number of pairs tabulated by
the fortune-teller. Each of the next E lines contains 3 integers A,BandC which means, if the company
pairs A with B, they will end up in a loss with amount C. (1  A,B  N) and 1000  C  1000).
The last test case will be followed immediately by a single line containing a 0. This line indicates the
end of file.
