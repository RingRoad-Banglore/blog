title: Uva 00253  Cube painting
---


## Input

```

Figure 1

We have a machine for painting cubes. It is supplied with three different
colors: blue, red and green. Each face of the cube gets one of these
colors. The cubes faces are numbered as in Figure 1.

Since a cube has 6 faces, our machine can paint a face-numbered
cube in 36 = 729 different ways. When ignoring the face-numbers,
the number of different paintings is much less, because a cube can be
rotated. See example below.

We denote a painted cube by a string of 6 characters, where each
character is a b, r, or g. The i-th character (1  i  6) from
the left gives the color of face i. For example, Figure 2 is a picture
of rbgggr and Figure 3 corresponds to rggbgr. Notice that both
cubes are painted in the same way: by rotating it around the vertical
axis by 90, the one changes into the other.

## Output

```
The input of your program is a textfile that ends with the standard end-of-file marker. Each line is a
string of 12 characters. The first 6 characters of this string are the representation of a painted cube, the
remaining 6 characters give you the representation of another cube. Your program determines whether
these two cubes are painted in the same way, that is, whether by any combination of rotations one can
be turned into the other. (Reflections are not allowed.)

```

## Sample Input

```
The output is a file of boolean. For each line of input, output contains TRUE if the second half can be
obtained from the first half by rotation as describes above, FALSE otherwise.

```

## Sample Output

```
rbgggrrggbgr
rrrbbbrrbbbr
rbgrbgrrrrrg
