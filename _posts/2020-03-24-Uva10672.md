title: Uva 10672  Marbles on a tree
---


```
n boxes are placed on the vertices of a rooted
tree, which are numbered from 1 to n, 1  n 
10000. Each box is either empty or contains a
number of marbles; the total number of marbles
is n.

The task is to move the marbles such that
each box contains exactly one marble. This
is to be accomplished be a sequence of moves;
each move consists of moving one marble to a
box at an adjacent vertex. What is the mini-
mum number of moves required to achieve the
goal?
```

## Input

```
The input contains a number of cases. Each
case starts with the number n followed by n lines. Each line contains at least three numbers which are:
v the number of a vertex, followed by the number of marbles originally placed at vertex v followed by
a number d which is the number of children of v, followed by d numbers giving the identities of the
children of v.

The input is terminated by a case where n = 0 and this case should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each case in the input, output the smallest number of moves of marbles resulting in one marble at
each vertex of the tree.

```
