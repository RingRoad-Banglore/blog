## Input

```
Soha and Tara have stopped playing the game mouse and cheese
which they invented few months ago. One of the main reasons
for discontinuing this game is that it involves a mouse  (Tara is
scared of anything that has four legs and can move). Since Tara
is fond of playing games, Soha came up with, yet, another game
that only involves a pen and a paper.

This new game is called Prime Game. Initially Soha writes
a list of N integers on a piece of paper. Its a two player game
where the players make moves alternately. Soha, being player 1,
goes first. The rules of this game are described below.

 In each move a player has to remove one or move contiguous
numbers either from left or right from the list. In his/her turn a player can say pass  which
means he/she doesnt have to remove any numbers in that move. However, a player can pass at
most K times.

 The sum of these removed integers has to be a prime number. Prime numbers are positive integers
that have exactly two distinct factors. So the first few prime numbers are 2 3 5 7 11 13 ...

 The number 42 is special and can take any value that the player chooses. For example, a player
can remove the integers {4 10 42} in one move; if 42 is treated as 3, then sum equals to 17 
which is a prime number.

 If a player uses up all his/her passes and doesnt have any valid move, then he/she is declared
as the loser.

If both the players play perfectly, who wins?
```

## Output

```
The first line of input file is an integer, T (T < 100) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
starts with 2 integers N (0 < N < 100) and K (0  K < 1000). The meanings of these are mentioned
above. The next line contains N space separated integers that Soha initially writes. Each of these
integers will be in the range [1000, 1000].

## Sample Input

For each case, output the case number first followed by the name of the player who wins. Look at the
sample for exact format.
