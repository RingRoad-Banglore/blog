title: Uva 12970  Alcoholic Pilots
---


## Input

```text
In one of his many trips, Mr. Ed boarded an airplane where the captain talked like... well, like he was
completely drunk. I would like to greet a very special person here, which has been part of our lives for
so much time. His wife says from the control tower that she loves you  the captain said. Of course,
Mr. Ed was really scared, how can alcoholic pilots flight with so many people on their hands? But that
was not the worst part, our friend noticed that these drunken pilots like to race between them!

By getting close to the captains cabin, Mr. Ed could hear another pilot (drunk, as expected)
discussing with the captain by radio. Both of them shared information about how fast they were
travelling and how far they were to the nearest airport. If I arrive earlier to the airport, you will owe
me a beer  the captain bragged, then the airplane started to move abruptly.

Of course Mr. Ed survived, if not, he could not tell us this story. But weirdly, you are wondering
who won the race between the pilots and their average arrival time, so you asked the velocity and
distance to the airport of both planes. Assume that the planes maintained their velocity even when
landing.
```

## Output

```text
The input will contain several test cases. The only line of each test case contains 4 space-separated
integers v1, d1, v2 and d2 (1  v1, d1, v2, d2  109): the velocity and distance to the airport of the plane
Mr. Ed and the captain were and the velocity and distance to the airport of the plane the captain was
competing with. Velocities are expressed in miles per hour and distances in miles.

The last test case is followed by a single line containing 4 zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Print 2 lines for each test case. In the first one, you should print You owe me a beer! if the captain
won the race or No beer for the captain. if the other airplane won the race.

You can safely assume there will be no draws in any test case.
In the second line, print Avg. arrival time: followed by the average arrival time (in hours)

of both airplanes expressed as a simplified fraction of the form xy, being x and y integers. If the
fraction has an integer result, print the result of the division. See format below for more details.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2 4 1 3
1 3 2 4
4 7 4 9
0 0 0 0
