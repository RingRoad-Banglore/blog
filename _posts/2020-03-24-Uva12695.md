title: Uva 12695  Traveling Fool
---


## Input

```text

You must have heard the Traveling Salesman Problem. Here we are talking about another problem
named Traveling Fool Problem. Assume that there are n cities connected by m one way roads. Each
road is labeled by an uppercase English letter (i.e A to Z). There can be multiple roads between two
cities but no roads will start and end at the same city.

The traveling fool starts his journey from city s and he continues his journey until he reaches t, or
he reaches a city from which t is unreachable. If he is in city u, he can choose any road that starts from
u with equal probability.

He may visit same city/road more than once, but once he reaches t, he immediately stops his journey
and remembers the road-labels he found in his path in the same order the roads were visited. If the
road-labels in the path he traveled form a palindrome, he finds himself lucky. If he is unable to reach t
or the road-labels dont form a valid palindrome, he finds himself unlucky.

Given the cities, roads, s and t, can you find the probability of Mr Traveling Fool being lucky?

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.
Each case starts with a blank line. Next line contains two integers n (2  n  12) and m (0  m 

1000). Each of the next m lines contains two integers, u v (0  u, v < n, u = v) and an uppercase
English letter w, meaning that there is a one-way road from city u to city v and the road label is w.
Next line contains an integer (1  q  150) denoting the number of queries. Each of the next q lines
contains two integers denoting s t (0  s, t < n, s = t).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number first. Then for each query, print the probability as stated. Errors
less than 104 will be ignored.
