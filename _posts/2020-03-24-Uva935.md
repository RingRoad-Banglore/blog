## Input

```text

Steve and Digit bought a box containing a number of cookies. In order to divide the cookies among
themselves they decided to play a special game they invented. The players alternately take a certain,
positive number of cookies from the box, but no more than a fixed integer. Each players cookies are
gathered on the players side. The player that empties the box eats his cookies while the other one puts
his cookies back into the box and the game continues with the looser player starting first. The game
goes on until all the cookies are eaten. The goal of the game is to eat the most cookies. How many
cookies can Steve, who starts the game, count on, assuming the best strategy for both players?

Your task consists of writing a program that:

 reads the parameters of the game from the standard input,

 computes the number of cookies that Steve can count on,

 writes the result to the standard output.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first and only line contains exactly two integers n and m separated by a single space, 1  m 

n  100  parameters of the game, where n is the number of cookies in the box at the beginning of
the game and m is the upper limit on the number of cookies to be taken by one player in one move.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output contains exactly one integer equal to the number of cookies that Steve
can count on, on a line by itself.

```

## Sample Output

```text
5 2

100 34

```
