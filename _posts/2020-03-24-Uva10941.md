title: Uva 10941  Words adjustment
---


```
In this problem, you are given two words x and y, and a finite sequence
of words {w1, w2, . . . wk}. If it is possible to obtain the same word by
appending to x and y some words from the given sequence of words, we
say that x and y can be adjusted. We would like to check whether the
words x and y can be adjusted using the words from the given sequence.

Given a word w, we can perform an operation w  wi, 1  i  k,
consisting in appending the word wi to the word w at the right. We
define this as an append operation. The task is to find the smallest
number of append operations that are necessary to adjust two given
words using the words from a given sequence.

For example, words abba and ab can be adjusted by the words from
the sequence { baaabad, aa, badccaa, cc }. It suffices to append to
abba two words: aa and badccaa, and to ab three words: baaabad, cc
and aa. In both cases we obtain: abbaaabadccaa.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains the number of cases that follow. The first two lines of data for each case
contain the words x and y, respectively. The third line contains the integer k, 0  k  1000, which is
the length of the sequence of words that can be used for word adjustment. The following k lines contain
one word each. All words use only lowercase letters and contain between 1 and 1000 characters.

```

## Output

```
For each case output one nonnegative integer giving the minimal number of operations that are needed
to adjust two given words, or output -1 if it is impossible.
