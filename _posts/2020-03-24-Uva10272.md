title: Uva 10272  DDR King

## Input

```
Do you know DDR? DDR = Dance Dance Revolution. Its a kind
of music game which was very popular not long ago. I was also
a DDR fan, but Im surely not the DDR King. Then, who is the
DDR King?

One person said, I am a DDR King. I can get one billion
points for Paranoia Max(Dirty Mix) 190 Green. This is obviously
a lie, since the highest score one can obtain playing that song is
385,317,900. You cannot understand why, if youre not familiar
with DDR Grading System, so let me introduce it to you first.

When playing a song, your task is to step on the specific arrow
correctly at the appropriate time. The score you got depends
totally on the judge result of each arrow. There are 5 possible
results for each arrow: PERFECT, GREAT, GOOD, BOO and
MISS. If you got a PERFECT or GREAT, you are set to be
comboing arrows, and the combo value is increased by 1. The
combo value is set to zero at the beginning of a song, and will reset to zero if you get GOOD, BOO or
MISS on an arrow. Only if you got PERFECT or GREAT on an arrow, you can get some score for that
arrow. If the combo value will be C AFTER current arrow, a PERFECT will get ((C  4)2 + 1)  300
points, and a GREAT will get ((C  4)2 +1)  100 points. (AB means the integer part of A/B). For
example, if the combo value is 11 after stepping on an arrow, a PERFECT will get 1500 points.

For example, if a song has 7 arrows, and a player got PERFECT,PERFECT,GREAT,PERFECT,
GREAT,PERFECT,MISS on each arrow, he/she will get 300,300,100,600,200,600 points on each arrow
and a total score of 2100 points.

Well, now, a person said that he got M points playing a song with N arrows and got a maximal
combo value of K during the whole song, tell me whether this is possible.
