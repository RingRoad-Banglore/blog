## Input

```text

Eva studies geometry. The current topic is about convex polygons, but Eva prefers rectangles. Evas
workbook contains drawings of several convex polygons and she is curious what is the area of the
maximum rectangle that fits inside each of them.

Help Eva! Given the convex polygon, find the rectangle of the maximum possible area that fits
inside this polygon. Sides of the rectangle must be parallel to the coordinate axes.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line contains a single integer n  the number of sides of the polygon (3  n  100000).
The following n lines contain Cartesian coordinates of the polygons vertices  two integers xi and

yi (109  xi, yi  109) per line. Vertices are given in the clockwise order.
The polygon is convex.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
Output four real numbers xmin, ymin, xmax and ymax  the coordinates of two rectangles corners

(xmin < xmax, ymin < ymax). The rectangle must fit into the polygon and have the maximum possible
area.

The absolute precision of the coordinates should be at least 105.
The absolute or relative precision of the rectangle area should be at least 105. That is, if A is the

actual maximum possible area, the following must hold: min(|AA|, |AA
|

A
)  105.
