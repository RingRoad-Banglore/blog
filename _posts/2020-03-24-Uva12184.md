title: Uva 12184  Transcribed Books
---


```
Long before Gutenberg invented letterpress printing, books have been transcribed by monks. Cloisters
wanted to be able to check that a book was transcribed by them (and not by a different cloister).
Although watermarked paper would have been an option, the cloister preferred to use a system of
hard-to-fake serial numbers for identifying their transcriptions.

Each serial number consists of 10 single numbers a1, a2, . . . , a10. Valid serial numbers satisfy a1 +
a2 + . . . + a9  a10 (modN) with 0  a10 < N . The N is specific to and only known by the cloister
that has transcribed this book and is therefore able to check its origin.

You are confronted with a pile of books that presumably have been transcribed by a single cloister.
You are asked to write a computer program to determine that cloister, i.e. to calculate the biggest
possible N that makes the serial numbers of these books valid. Obviously, no cloister has chosen
N = 1. So if your calculations yield N = 1, there must be something wrong.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer t on a single line, the number of test cases (1  t  100). Each test
case starts with an integer c on a single line, the number of serial numbers you have to consider
(2  c  1000). Each of the following c lines holds 10 integer numbers a1, a2, . . . , a10 (0  ai < 228)
separated by single spaces.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a single line containing the largest possible N , so that each given serial
number for that test case is valid. If you cannot find a N > 1 satisfying the condition for all serial
numbers or if the numbers are valid independent of the choice of N , output impossible (without the
quotes) on a single line.
