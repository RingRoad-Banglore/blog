title: Uva 12233  Final Combat
---


```
Youre playing an RPG, which is arguably the best Chinese RPG in 2007. You got to the final combat.
You want to win as soon as possible. Do you know what I am talking about?

For competitors whore not familiar with the game: were giving a brief introduction to the
combat system and the characters involved in that last combat very soon.

For competitors whore too familiar with the game: were simplifying and/or changing the
rules and facts for this problem. We apologize if you feel unhappy about that.

Fig. The final combat

The screenshot above gives you some idea about the combat system and the characters, which can
be summarized as follows:

 You have 4 heroes: Yun Tianhe (YTH), Han Lingsha (HLS), Liu Mengli (LML) and Murong Ziying
(MRZY). Before the combat begins, you need to choose exactly three heroes and rearrange them
in some order. Lets call the 1st, 2nd and 3rd hero H1, H2 and H3, respectively. In this screenshot
above, H1 is YTH, H2 is HLS and H3 is LML. (Sorry for the Ziying fans!)

 There are two bosses: Xuan Xiao (XX) and Su Yao (SY), both in the back of the screenshot.

 The goal of this combat is to defeat SY. In this problem, you can assume that XX is immortal,
although its possible to defeat him in the real game.

The key to this problem is to understand the semi round-based combat system. See the progress
bar on the top of the screen? Each hero has a very small progress ball (in light-blue) on the bar,
with an icon above the ball. Similarly, each boss also has a ball (in red), but the icon is below the ball.
When the combat begins, all the progress balls start moving from the left corner of the bar. When a
ball reaches the right corner, the corresponding character is able to act. If more than one character
can act, they make actions one by one, according to this precedence order: YTH, HLS, LML, MRZY,
XX, SY. When a character is acting, all progress balls stopped moving. After a character finished an
action, his/her progress ball is reset to the left corner of the progress bar. When nobody is acting, all
progress balls go right simultaneously (but possibly with different speeds, see below).

In this problem, each character has 4 main properties: Jing, Qi, Shen, Su.

 Jing means health. When a characters Jing reaches zero or negative, he/she is defeated. A
characters maximum Jing is denoted by parameter maxjing.

 Qi means vitality. It is used by special-skill attacks. When Qi is not enough, certain special-skill
attacks cannot be performed. A characters maximum Qi is always 100.

 Shen means spirit. It is used by Xian Shu (something similar to, but more amazing than
magic). When Shen is not enough, certain Xian Shu cannot be performed. A characters
maximum Shen is denoted by parameter maxshen.

 Su means speed. It affects how quick a characters progress ball moves. Su is always a positive
integer less than 5. If a characters Su is x, it takes 5 x units time for his/her progress ball to
move from left corner to the right corner of the progress bar. A characters Su (which is never
changed during the combat) is denoted by parameter su.

For simplicity, you may assume that both XX and SY use the same strategy:

 In his/her (4n+ 1)-th action (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .), make a weapon attack upon H1.

 In his/her (4n+ 2)-th action (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .), make a weapon attack upon H2.

 In his/her (4n+ 3)-th action (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .), make a weapon attack upon H3.

 In his/her (4n+ 4)-th action (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .), make a special-skill attack upon all the heroes.

Now we introduce four more parameters for each hero. The first two, d1x and d2x, are the damages
that the hero takes on XXs weapon attack and special-skill attack, respectively. For SYs attacks, we
define d1s and d2s similarly.

Youre very tired, so you dont want to waste your time designing complex tactics. When a hero is
about to act, you only consider the following actions:

 Make a physical weapon attack upon either XX or SY (cannot attack both). Be warned
though, SY is surrounded by swords (see the screenshot), so making weapon attacks upon her
would hurt the attacker himself/herself. The amount of reflection damage that the attacker
takes is the same as the physical damage that SY takes. Attacking XX (yes, you can do that,
if you like) does not suffer from physical reflection.

 Use Xian Shu to recover Jing. To make your brain easier, you decided not to recover other
heroes Jing. In this problem, the only Xian Shu that you can use is called Yu Run, which
recovers yurun_jing points of Jing (if the resulting Jing exceeds his/her maximum Jing, it is
reduced to the maximum) and uses yurun_shen points of Shen.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12233  Final Combat 3/5

 Use items to recover Shen. To make your brain easier, you decided not to recover other
heroes Shen. In this problem, the only item that you can use is called Shu Er Guo, which
recovers shuerguo_shen points of Shen (if the resulting Shen exceeds his/her maximum Shen,
it is reduced to the maximum). You have an infinite number of Shu Er Guo.

 Make a special-skill attack if his/her Qi is enough. Each hero has exactly one special-skill
attack, attacking both XX and SY. Note that some special-skill attacks are physical. Using a
physical special-skill attack makes you take the same damage as SY, just like weapon attacks.

Now its time to introduce four more parameters for each hero: wad, ssd, ssq and ssp. The number
of Jing points that SY takes by the heros weapon attacks and special-skill attacks are denoted by wad
and ssd, respectively. The special-skill attack is physical if and only if ssp = 1 (otherwise, ssp = 0). It
needs ssq points of Qi.

As you may have noticed, Qi cannot be recovered by Xian Shu or items. There are only two ways
to increase Qi: make a weapon attack, or get hit by a weapon attack. Being hurt by physical reflection
does not earn you extra Qi.

So here come the last two parameters for each hero: q1 and q2, that means making a weapon attack
increases q1 points of Qi (whether or not youre reflected), while getting hit by a weapon attack increases
q2 points of Qi. If the resulting Qi exceeds his/her maximum Qi (which is always 100), it is reduced
to the maximum. Again, performing a special-skill attack never increases your Qi. Getting hurt by the
bosses special-skill attacks never increases your Qi, either.

As a perfectionist, you dont want any hero to be defeated even temporarily (in the real game you
can rebirth a hero with certain Xian Shu or items)  for example, its not allowed to make YTH
and SY defeated at the same time (it can happen, for example, after YTH has performed a powerful
physical special-skill attack).

Finally comes the question: what is the earliest time (we only care about ball-moving time, not
including time needed to make attacks) that you can win the combat, if you play optimally? To play
optimally, you need to choose between the options listed above, for each act. Its not as easy as it
sounds. Be careful!
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each case begins with 6 positive integers, SY _jing (SYs initial
Jing), XX_su (XXs Su), SY _su (SYs Su), yurun_jing, yurun_shen and shuerguo_shen. The
next four lines contain descriptions of YTH, HLS, LML and MRZY, in this order. Each line contains
16 non-negative integers: maxjing, maxshen, su, d1x, d2x, d1s, d2s, wad, ssd, ssq, ssp, q1, q2, jing,
qi, shen. The last three parameters are the initial Jing, Qi and Shen values of this hero before the
combat begins. The limits of most parameters are listed below:

Parameter(s) min max
SY _jing 1 100,000

yurun_jing, maxjing, d1x, d2x, d1s, d2s 1 8,000
yurun_shen, shuerguo_shen, maxshen 1 800

XX_su, SY _su, su 1 4
wad, ssd 1 100,000

ssp 0 1
q1, q2, ssq 1 100

And finally, 1  jing  maxjing, 0  qi  100, 0  shen  maxshen. The last test case is followed
by 6 zeros, which should not be processed.

## Output

```
For each test case, print the earliest time that you can win, and all possible orderings to achieve this.
Each ordering is expressed as the concatenation of the first letters of H1, H2 and H3s names. For
example, if H1 = HLS, H2 = LML, H3 = YTH, the ordering is expressed as HLY. The orderings should be
sorted in increasing order lexicographically. If you cant win the combat within 12 units of ball-moving
time, print -1.

Print a blank line after the output of each test case.

Explanation:
In the first sample, you can win the combat just after one action for each hero (at time 4, since all

the su values are 1), but you need to be careful.
YTHs special-skill attack is powerful (damage=900), but his Qi is not enough (10 < 20). You cant

use HLSs weapon attack, since shell get defeated by physical reflection. LMLs weapon attack is weak,
but she can use her special-skill attack even though shell get hurt by reflection (her special-skill attack
is physical), since 400 < 450. For MRZY, his special-skill is physical, and too powerful, so we cant use
it, since 700 > 600.

To summarize, we can use YTHs weapon attack (damage=300), HLSs special-skill attack (dam-
age=300), LMLs weapon attack (damage=100) and special-skill attack (damage=400), and MRZYs
weapon attack (damage=250). Its not hard to see, the only possible combination that can finish
the combat in the quickest way is YTH, HLS and LML (use special-skill attack), the ordering is arbitrary.
Note that the combat ends immediately after SY is defeated, so dont worry about the terrible attacks
of XX and SY.

In the second sample, YTH is too weak so we ignore him immediately. You cant avoid XXs first
attack, which is able to defeat everyone except LML, so LML seems to be the only possible H1. However,
HLS moves before XX, so she can also be H1 if she uses Yu Run in her first action. Unfortunately, MRZY
cant be H1, since hes not quick enough to recover Jing before XX attacks.

All the weapon attacks are too weak, so the best strategy is to accumulate Qi first, then perform
the powerful special-skill attacks when possible. LMLs su is too low, but her Qi is enough at startup.
All she needs to do is to recover Shen, then recover Jing, and then do the attack (Why so complex?
because her powerful special-skill attack is physical . . .). Note that SY is only able to attack two heroes
before the combat ends, so H3 has one fewer chance to increase Qi by reflection. Actually, it can be
proven that neither HLS nor MRZY can be H3  if so, theyll be unable to gain enough Qi for their
special-skill attacks.

To summarize, HLS can be H1 or H2, LML can be all, while MRZY can only be H1. So the only possible
ordering is H1 = HLS, H2 = MRZY, H3 = LML.

In the third sample, it seems that you can defeat SY with HLSs special-skill attack (damage=6861)
and LMLs specialskill attack (damage=24850). However, LML needs to recover Jing to avoid being
defeated, but her initial Shen is not enough. If we changed her initial Shen to 543 (enough for Yu
Run), the answer would become 6 LYH LYM.
