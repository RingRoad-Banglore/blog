## Input

```text
An approach of representing the stresses (force per unit area) on a body is the Mohrs Circle - devised
by Otto Mohr in 1882. Its a very nice method of representing the stresses and analyze where they
occur, so its used widely. In this problem we are not concerned with the details of the theory, we will
just know how to use this device at work.

Drawing Mohrs Circle

Let a stress state is described by two principle stresses (Load which tries to compress or elongate)
x, y and two torsional stresses (Load which tries to twist) xy, yx as shown in the example below,
Figure a. As yx is always equal to xy but in reverse direction, in the input these will be given as x,
y and xy. Thus input for the following condition is (32, -10, 20, CCW).

Step 1 : Draw two perpendicular line indicating horizontal line as  axis and the vertical line as 
axis. The point of intersection is the center point (0,0) and both the stresses is zero there. See
Figure b below.

Step 2 : Locate points (x, xy) and (y, yx) and connect them with a straight line. Indicated by
point A (32, -20) and B (-10, 20) respectively in Figure b.

Step 3 : Draw a circle with the line AB as the diameter and the intersection of the line AB and DE
( axis) as the center (point C).

Now for maximum normal stress condition:

 Maximum normal stress angle = half of angle ACD = 43.6 / 2 = 21.8 degree. Angle ACD will
not be greater than 90 degree only for current problem.

 Maximum and minimum normal stress = OD and OE respectively = 40 and -18 respectively.

For maximum shear stress condition

 Maximum shear stress angle = half of angle ACD + 45 = 21.8 + 45 = 66.8 degree

 Maximum shear stress = CF = 29

 Normal stress at this condition = OC = 11

Remember, on the ordinate clockwise (CW) shear stresses are plotted up; counterclockwise (CCW)
shear stresses are plotted down. Moreover yx always has the same value as xy but inverse in direction,
i.e. yx = xy.

## Output

```text
First line of input will contain a stress state with three numbers x, y and xy (all in the range of
-1000 MPa to 1000 MPa) followed by a string (CW or CCW) stating the direction of the torsional stress
if not zero (i.e. The string will not appear if xy is zero).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each system , First of all output angle ACD, then the value OD and OE on the next line. Then
print a blank line.

After that print maximum shear stress angle as stated in the example above (angle ACD + 45). On
the next line print the value of CF, followed by the value of CO.

Each real number must be rounded to the nearest 2 digits after the decimal point. Consider
the format of the sample output below while printing the values. Output a blank line between two
consecutive output set.
