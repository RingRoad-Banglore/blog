Little Onuvob has learnt to read wall clock.Very often he loudly announces the time. He has a big clock
in his room. There is also a mirror in the opposite side of the clock. Few days ago his mother noticed
that sometimes Onuvob is announcing wrong time. She became worried and after some investigation
she found, Onuvob has no problem in reading time from the clock, the thing is sometimes he reads from
the clock in the mirror. So she told him

Onuvob, you shouldnt read time from the clock in the mirror.
But why ma? curious Onuvob asked.
Because it gives wrong time mother replied.

Now Onuvob looked at the two clocks and realized his mother was
telling the truth. Two clocks were not matching. He thought for some
time and shouted, But ma, we can calculate the real time from the
clock in the mirror, cant we?

Can we? Now you have to answer.
