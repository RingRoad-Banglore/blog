## Input

Figure 1. Shape of a
block

According to recent activities in the Computer Engineering department, ACM
(Association for Construction Management) has signed a contract with the
department to build some pre-constructed blocks which can be attached to
each other and easily form a building.

These blocks are cubes and have facilities for being attached to other
blocks face to face. The problem is that these connecting facilities are not
the same. Each of the 6 faces of a block has its own type of connector named
1 to 6 respectively, as shown in figure 1. To connect two cubes to each other,
their adjacent faces must have the same connector type or the sum of their
connector numbers must be equal to 7.

Figure 2. A 3 3 3 Construction

Faculty will give ACM a map for constructing the build-
ing. The building is actually an M  N  K rectangular
prism. Furthermore, faculty has decided to have some of
the blocks on some faces of the prism fixed. In other words,
some of the blocks on the faces of the prism must have a pre-
determined connector facing outside. Given a map for the
building to be constructed, you must help ACM to decide
whether it can build the requested building with respect to
the limitations of the problem or not.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file consists of a single integer
1  T  10, 000 , the total number of test cases. For each
test case, there is a line indicating 1  M,N,K  10. After
this line, comes the description of each face of the whole
building. Each number shows that which face of a block must be seen in that position. Whenever a ?
is represented, it means there is no difference in which face of the block to be used there. Only 3 faces
of the whole prism are given. First you will see K rows each one with N columns, representing face T
(top face of the building). Then, there is M rows each one with N columns, representing face F (front
face) and at last, there is M rows each one with K columns, representing face R (right side face). The
order each face is introduced is the same as figure 2.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, simply write YES if it is possible to arrange blocks in some way which fits in
the conditions of the input or write NO if it is not possible.
