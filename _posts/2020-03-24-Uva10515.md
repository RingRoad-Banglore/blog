```
Finding the exponent of any number can be very troublesome as it grows exponentially. But in this
problem you will have to do a very simple task. Given two non-negative numbers m and n, you will
have to find the last digit of mn in decimal number system.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains less than 100000 lines. Each line contains two integers m and n (Less than 10101.
Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes. This line should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input you must produce one line of output which contains a single digit. This digit is
the last digit of mn.

```

## Sample Input

```
2 2
2 5
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
4
