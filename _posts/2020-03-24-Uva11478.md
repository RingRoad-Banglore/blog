title: Uva 11478  Halum
---


## Input

```

You are given a directed graph G(V,E) with a set of vertices and edges. Each edge (i, j) that connects
some vertex i to vertex j has an integer cost associated with that edge.

Define the operation Halum(v, d) to operate on a vertex v using an integer d as follows: subtract d
from the cost of all edges that enter v and add d to the cost of every edge that leaves v.

As an example of that operation, consider graph G that has three vertices named (1, 2, 3) and two
edges. Edge (1, 2) has cost -1, and edge (2,3) has cost 1. The operation Halum(2,3) operates on
edges entering and leaving vertex 2. Thus, edge (1, 2) gets cost -1-(-3)=2 and the edge (2, 3) gets cost
1 + (-3) = -2.

Your goal is to apply the Halum function to a graph, potentially repeatedly, until every edge in the
graph has at least a certain cost that is greater than zero. You have to maximize this cost.
```

## Output

```
Two space-separated integers per case: V (V  500) and E (E  2700). E lines follow. Each line
represents a directed edge using three space-separated integers (u, v, d). Absolute value of cost can be
at most 10000.

## Sample Input

```
If the problem is solvable, then print the maximum possible value. If there is no such solution print No
Solution. If the value can be arbitrary large print Infinite
