title: Uva 12729  Squares Game
---


## Input

```

What could be Ana and Bob doing while the world is being destroyed? Playing, of course!

Its a simple game, in a rectangular board with N rows and M columns (N M cells). Ana starts
playing: she can pick any position in the board where theres a square of 22 unmarked cells and mark
them. Then, its Bobs turn: he can pick any unmarked cell and mark it. If a player has no move, he
passes his turn, until theres no unmarked cells. Who marks the largest number of cells wins the game.

Ana and Bob are optimal players, and they always play to win (or draw if they cannot win).

Possible sequence of a game between Ana and Bob, where Ana marks red and Bob marks blue. Note
that, by the end of this sequence of turns, ana wont be able to mark further cells and will always pass

her turn to Bob.
