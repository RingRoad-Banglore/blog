## Input

```text
Given an even integer N , print a sequence of
2N different N -bit binary numbers in such way
that every element of the sequence (except the
first one) has exactly one bit the same as the
previous one (e.g. 0001 and 1111)
```

## Output

```text
The input starts with an integer T  the num-
ber of test cases (T  8). T cases follow on
each subsequent line, each of them containing
the integer N (2  N  16).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a sequence that satis-
fies the stated condition, one integer per line.

Any valid sequence will be accepted.

Note: The sequence in the sample output in binary is {00,01,11,10}

```

## Sample Output

```text
1
2

```
