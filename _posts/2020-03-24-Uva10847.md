## Input

```
Let A := {=, , a, b, c, . . ., z, A, B, C, . . ., Z}.

We assume that  represent the operation of concatenation between strings.
We define the set of formulas over A recursively as follows:

 If X belongs to A \ {=,} then X is formula (variable).

 IF X is a formula, so is X  .

 If X and Y are formulas, so is: X  Y  =.

These formulas are understood as logical formulas with connectives - for negation, = for equivalence
and A\{=,} as variables. That is = and  are not variables. Also, variables a and A are considered
different. Similarly b is different to B and so on.

Of course our formulas are given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). We can evaluate a formula for
a given boolean input {0, 1} and the output is either 0 or 1 as usual.

A formula is a tautology if it evaluates to 1 for every input. For example aa= is a tautology while
aa= is not. Note that aa= represents the formula a=a in the standard infix notation and aa=
represents the formula [a=a].
```

## Output

```
The first line is a natural number N less than 100. Then, there are N lines, each one is a string over
A. Every string is of size less than 200 characters.

```

## Sample Input

```
You must display N lines, each one with 3 possible answers: incorrect, tautology or formula. Answer
number i gives the output of string number i. The output is incorrect if the input string is not a
formula. The output is formula if the input string is a formula that is not a tautology. The output
is tautology if the input string is a formula that is a tautology.

Note:
Perhaps some students have no idea on how to evaluate a formula in RPN form. However I assume

that she/he knows how to do it in the standard form, hence I need only to describe how to convert
a RPN formula into a standard infix form. We define f(X) the translation of a RPN formula X by
recursion as follows:

We assume that X,Y, Z represent formulas.

1. If X is a variable then f(X) := X.

2. If X is of the form Y   then f(X) := [  f(Y )].

3. If X is of the form Y  Z = then f(X) := [f(Y ) = f(Z)].

where [ and ] are parenthesis symbols (not needed in a RPN formula).
Just in case, I include the truth tables for = and .

The truth table for = is:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10847  Basic Tautologies 2/2

A B A=B
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 1

The truth table for - is:
A -A
0 1
1 0

Good luck!
