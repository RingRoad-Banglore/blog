---


```
Given two integers N and D, you will have to find how many of the factors of N ! (factorial N) are
divisible by D.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains two integers N (0  N  100) and
D (0 < |D|  231  1). Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes. This line should not be
processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains a single integer, which denotes of
many different factors of N ! are divisible by D.

```

## Sample Input

```
10 2
9 3
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
240
128
```
