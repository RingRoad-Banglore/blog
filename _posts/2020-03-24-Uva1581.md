## Input

```

As an employee of Aqueous Contaminate Management, you must monitor the pollution that gets
dumped (sometimes accidentally, sometimes purposefully) into rivers, lakes and oceans. One of your
jobs is to measure the impact of the pollution on various ecosystems in the water such as coral reefs,
spawning grounds, and so on.

Figure J.1: Illustration of Sample Input 1.

The model you use in your analysis is illustrated in Figure J.1. The shoreline (the horizontal line in
the figure) lies on the x-axis with the source of the pollution located at the origin (0,0). The spread of
the pollution into the water is represented by the semicircle, and the polygon represents the ecosystem
of concern. You must determine the area of the ecosystem that is contaminated, represented by the
dark blue region in the figure.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. A test case starts with a line containing two integers n and
r, where 3  n  100 is the number of vertices in the polygon and 1  r  1000 is the radius of the
pollution field. This is followed by n lines, each containing two integers xi, yi, giving the coordinates
of the polygon vertices in counter-clockwise order, where 1500  xi  1500 and 0  yi  1500. The
polygon does not self-intersect or touch itself. No vertex lies on the circle boundary.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, display the area of the polygon that falls within the semicircle centered at the origin
with radius r. Give the result with an absolute error of at most 103.
