```
David hates to wait at stop signs, yield signs and traffic signals while driving. To minimize this
aggravation, he has prepared maps of the various regions in which he frequently drives, and measured
the average delay (in seconds) at each of the various intersections in these regions. He wants to find the
routes between specified points in these regions which minimize his delay at intersections (regardless of
the total distance he has to drive to avoid delays), and has enlisted your assistance in this effort.
```

## Input

```
For each region, David provides you with a map. The map data first identifies some number of inter-
sections, NI. The regions never include more than 10 intersections. The intersections in each region
are numbered sequentially, starting with the number one (1). For each intersection, in turn, the input
then specifies the number of streets leading away from the intersection, and for each such street, the
number of the intersection to which the street leads, and the average delay, in seconds, that David
encounters at that intersection. Following the data for the last intersection in a region there appear
the numbers associated with the intersections where David wants to start and end his drive. The entire
input consists of a sequence of maps, followed by the single integer zero (0).

```

## Output

```
For each region, in order, print a single line of output which contains the region number (they, too,
are sequentially numbered, starting with 1), a list of the intersection numbers David will encounter in
the route with minimum average delay, and the average number of seconds he will be delayed while
travelling this route. A suitable format is shown in the example below.

Notes:

1. There will always be a unique route with the minimum average delay in each region.

2. A street from intersection I to intersection J is one-way. To represent a two-way street from I to
J , the map must also include a route from intersection J to intersection I.

3. There will never be more than one route directly from intersection I to intersection J .

Example: Suppose David wants to travel from intersection 2 to intersection 4 in the region shown in
the following map:

+---------------+ From To Delay
| V 1 3 3
1<------2------>3------>4<------5 1 4 6
| | ^ ^ 2 1 2
| +---------------|-------+ 2 3 7
| | 2 5 6
+-----------------------+ 3 4 5

5 4 7
