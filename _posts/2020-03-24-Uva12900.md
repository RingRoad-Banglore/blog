title: Uva 12900  Flood in Gridland
---


## Input

```text
The country of Gridland is very special. It is divided into N rows and M columns; and both of them are
1 indexed. The intersection cell of the i-th row and the j-th column will be denoted as land(i, j). land(i,
j) is either a flat surface of height Hij or does not have any land rather it contains only bottomless sea
water. All heights are measured from sea level; if Hij is negative then it means the surface of that land
is under the sea level.

Gridland is very much prone to natural calamities. Some lands of the Gridland are so low that they
become flood affected most of the time in a year. Again some land are so high that there is always fog
in those lands. This has been a dream of the people from Gridland for many years that the height of
the country will be adjusted to reduce effect of natural calamities. Government of Gridland decided to
increase or decrease heights of all the lands such that heights of all the lands reside between L and U.
But people of Gridland also wants to maximize the average height of the country. So government of
Gridland decided to maximize the sum of the heights of all the lands.

To increase or decrease height government can perform two operations

1. Increase the heights of all the land of a row by 1.

Example 1:

2. Decrease the heights of all the lands of a column by 1.

Example 2:

As mentioned above some cell contains bottomless sea water, those cells will be denoted as X. No
operation has any effect on those lands.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12900  Flood in Gridland 2/3

Given N , M , L, U and the height H of all the lands, use the operations described above to increase
or decrease height of the lands such that the new heights of the lands are between the range L and U
(inclusive) and sum of the heights of all the lands is the maximum. Help government of Gridland to
solve the problem.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T  300), number of test cases. First line of each
test case contains four integers N , M , L and U (1  N,M  75, 1000  L  U  1000). Each of the
next N lines contains M integers Hij (500  Hij  500), height of land(i, j) or character X, where
X means that the cell has bottomless sea water.

Note: 90% of all the test cases contain N,M  20.

```

## Sample Input

```text
First line of each test case contains test case number and Impossible, if there is no way to change
the heights of all the lands with the operations described above such that the new height of each land
remains between L and U . Otherwise print the sum of the new heights of all the lands (except X
marked lands). Following line contains N non-negative integers Ri (Ri  1000000), where Ri is the
number of operation 1 applied on the row i and the next line will contain M non-negative integers Cj
(Cj  1000000), where Cj is the number of operation 2 applied on column j.

If there is any solution for a test case, then there will always be a solution with 0  Ri  1000000
and 0  Cj  1000000.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
