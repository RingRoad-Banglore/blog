I am sure about your interest with combinations. Why not put
yourself into a test to see your flair?

So here is the problem: You are given an integer n(less than
999). You have to evaluate the expression given at right. Hope to
see you successful with this. You should count any term as zero
which has k < j.

## Input
The first line of input is an integer t(< 2000). Then follows t lines each of which contain n as described
before.

## Output
There should be one line of output for each input which will be the value of the above expression for
the corresponding n.

## Sample Input
<p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>7</p><p>14</p>
