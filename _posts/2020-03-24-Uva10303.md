title: Uva 10303  How Many Trees
---


## Input

```
A binary search tree is a binary tree with root k such that any node v reachable from its left has
label(v) < label(k) and any node w reachable from its right has label(w) > label(k). It is a search
structure which can find a node with label x in O(nlogn) average time, where n is the size of the tree
(number of vertices).

Given a number n, can you tell how many different binary search trees may be constructed with a
set of numbers of size n such that each element of the set will be associated to the label of exactly one
node in a binary search tree?
```

## Output

```
The input will contain a number 1  i  1000 per line representing the number of elements of the set.
