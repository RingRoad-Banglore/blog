## Input

```
This is an extreme version of a boring mathematics problem.

Let us recall the scenario: we have three different integers, x, y and z, which satisfy the following
three relations:

 x+ y + z = A

 xyz = B

 x2 + y2 + z2 = C

You are asked to write a program that solves for x, y and z for given values of A, B and C.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file gives the number of test cases N (N < 250) lines gives the values of A,
B and C (1  A,B,C  6 1018 = 6000000000000000000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the corresponding values of x, y and z. If there are many possible answers,
choose the one with the least value of x. If there is a tie, output the one with the least value of y. If
there is no solution, output the line No solution. instead.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
1 2 3
6 6 14

```
