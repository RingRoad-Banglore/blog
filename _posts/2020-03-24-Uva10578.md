title: Uva 10578  The Game of 31
---


## Input

```text
The game of 31 was a favourite of con artists who rode the railroads in days of yore. The game is
played with a deck of 24 cards: four labelled each of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The cards in the deck are visible
to both players, who alternately withdraw one card from the deck and place it on a pile. The object
of the game is to be the last player to lay a card such that the sum of the cards in the pile does not
exceed 31. Your task is to determine the eventual winner of a partially played game, assuming each
player plays the remainder of the game using a perfect strategy.

For example, in the following game player B wins:

Player A plays 3
Player B plays 5
Player A plays 6
Player B plays 6
Player A plays 5
Player B plays 6
```

## Output

```text
The input will consist of several lines; each line consists of a sequence of zero or more digits representing
a partially completed game. The first digit is player As move; the second player Bs move; and so on.
You are to complete the game using a perfect strategy for both players and to determine who wins.

```

## Sample Input
