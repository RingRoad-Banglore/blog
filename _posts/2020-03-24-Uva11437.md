title: Uva 11437  Triangle Fun
---


```
In the picture below you can see a triangle ABC. Point D, E and F divides the sides BC, CA and
AB into ratio 1:2 respectively. That is CD=2BD, AE=2CE and BF=2AF. A, D; B, E and C, F are
connected. AD and BE intersects at P, BE and CF intersects at Q and CF and AD intersects at R.

So now a new triangle PQR is formed. Given triangle ABC your job is to find the area of triangle
PQR.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 1001) which denotes how many sets
of inputs are there. Input for each set contains six floating-point number Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy.
(0  Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy  10000) in one line line. These six numbers denote that the coordinate of
points A, B and C are (Ax, Ay), (Bx, By) and (Cx, Cy) respectively. A, B and C will never be collinear.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This one line contains an integer AREA. Here AREA
is the area of triangle PQR, rounded to the nearest integer.
