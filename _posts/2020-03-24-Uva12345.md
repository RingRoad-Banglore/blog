title: Uva 12345  Dyanmic len(set(a[L:R]))
---


## Input

```text
In python, we can use len(start(a[L:R])) to calculate the number of distinct values of elements a[L],
a[L+ 1], , a[R 1].

Here are some interactive examples that may help you understand how it is done. Remember that
the indices of python lists start from 0.

>>>
a=[1,2,1,3,2,1,4]
>>> print a[1:6]
[2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
>>> print set(a[1:6])
set([1, 2, 3])
>>> print
len(set(a[1:6]))
3
>>> a[3]=2
>>> print
len(set(a[1:6]))
2
>>> print len(set(a[3:5]))
1

Your task is to simulate this process.
```

## Output

```text
There will be only one test case. The first line contains two integers n and m (1  n,m  50, 000).
The next line contains the original list.

All the integers are between 1 and 1,000,000 (inclusive). The next m lines contain the statements
that you need to execute.

A line formatted as M x y (1  y  1, 000, 000) means a[x] = y, and a line formatted as Q x y
means print len(set(a[x : y])).

It is guaranteed that the statements will not cause index out of range error.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Print the simulated result, one line for each query.

```

## Sample Output

```text
7 4
1 2 1 3 2 1 4
Q 1 6
M 3 2
Q 1 6
Q 3 5
