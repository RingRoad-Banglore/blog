title: Uva 12441  Superb Sequence
---


```
There were three friends (Alice, Bob and Carol) who regularly went to expeditions and discovered new
mountain peaks. They often proposed different names and it was a problem to decide which name they
would choose for the newly discovered peaks. Alice and Bob both said that the name of the peak must
be a super sequence of their proposed names A and B, i.e. A and B should be subsequences of the
name of the peak. Carol said that the name of the peak must be a subsequence of her proposed name
C. As they dont like long names, they want to know the number of distinct shortest names which
satisfy their needs.

So, given three strings A, B and C, you have to find the number of distinct shortest common super
sequences of A and B who are also a subsequence of C. Moreover, you need to find the lexicographically
earliest such sequence. Two sequences are distinct if they differ in at least one position. A subsequence
is a sequence obtained by deleting zero or more characters from a string. A super-sequence is a
sequence obtained by inserting zero or more characters in one or more positions of the string.

For example, say, A = cdfa, B = dga and C = bcdfgaga. Then there are two shortest common
super sequences of A and B: cdfga and cdgfa, but cdgfa is not a subsequence of C. So the only
possible name for the peak is cdfga.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input will contain T ( 250) denoting the number of cases.

Each case contains three lines. First line contains a string denoting A, second line contains B and
third line contains C. Assume that the strings are non-empty and length of A and B will not be more
than 100 and length of C will not be more than 300.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the case number and the number of distinct possible shortest names for the peak
modulo 1000 000 007. And second line should contain the lexicographically earliest name. If no solution
is found then print NOT FOUND in second line.
