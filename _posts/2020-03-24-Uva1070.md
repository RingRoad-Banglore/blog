title: Uva 01070  Conveyor Belt
---


```
Many mechanical systems work with rotating shafts connected with conveyor belts. The shafts have a
variety of sizes and rotate in either a clockwise or a counterclockwise manner. The exact way in which
a belt will connect two shafts depends on their rotations, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.

One task in setting up such mechanical systems is to link together two given shafts, subject to these
constraints:

 If the two shafts being connected are too far apart, the belt may start to vibrate chaotically when
perturbed slightly. To prevent this, you can connect shafts only when the distance between the
points where the belt leaves one shaft and touches the other is less than some distance d (the
exact value of d varies depending on the type of belt).

 No belt can cross over itself, as shown in Figure 3.

 No belt can pass through another shaft (or touch one rotating the wrong way), as shown in Figure
4.

 The belt is not a loop; it goes in only one direction, from the starting shaft to the ending shaft.
The starting shaft pushes the belt and the ending shaft pulls it.

As an example, consider the problem of connecting shaft
A to shaft D in Figure 5. Suppose that the distance needed
to connect A to C (shown in blue dashed line) or to connect
B to D is greater than the limit allowed. Then the shortest
distance to connect A to D is shown in solid line, going from
shaft A to B to C and then D. Notice that the connection
cannot go from B to E and then D as the belt would cross
itself.

You must write a program that calculates the minimum
length of the belt to connect the two given shafts.

## Input

```
The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer N
(1  N  20) indicating the number of shafts, numbered from 0 to N  1. Starting on the next line are
N four-tuples of the form x y r s, where x and y are the integer coordinates of a shaft center, r is the
integer radius of the shaft, and s is either C for clockwise or CC for counterclockwise (0  x, y  10000
and 0 < r  1000). Positive x is right and positive y is up. The first four-tuple specifies shaft 0, the
second one shaft 1 and so on. These four-tuples may extend over multiple lines, though no four-tuple
will be split across two lines. No two shafts touch or overlap. The last line of each test case contains two
integers i and j indicating the starting and ending shafts, followed by a floating point value d specifying
the maximum distance constraint.

The last test case is followed by a line containing a single zero.

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number (starting with 1) followed by the length of the path of minimum
distance. Print Cannot reach destination shaft if the destination shaft cannot be reached. Use
the format shown in the sample output.

When measuring the distance, start where the belt first leaves the starting shaft and end where
the belt first touches the ending shaft. Your distance calculation must include both the length of belt
between shafts as well as the distance the belt travels around intermediate shafts. Your answer should
be rounded to the nearest hundredth, though you need not print trailing zeroes after the decimal point.
