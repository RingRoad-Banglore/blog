title: Uva 00325  Identifying Legal Pascal Real Constants
---


## Input

```text
Pascal requires that real constants have either a decimal point, or an exponent (starting with the letter
e or E, and officially called a scale factor), or both, in addition to the usual collection of decimal digits.
If a decimal point is included it must have at least one decimal digit on each side of it. As expected,
a sign (+ or -) may precede the entire number, or the exponent, or both. Exponents may not include
fractional digits. Blanks may precede or follow the real constant, but they may not be embedded within
it. Note that the Pascal syntax rules for real constants make no assumptions about the range of real
values, and neither does this problem.

Your task in this problem is to identify legal Pascal real constants.
