title: Uva 10259  Hippity Hopscotch
---


## Input

```
The game of hopscotch involves chalk, sidewalks, jumping, and picking things up. Our variant of
hopscotch involves money as well. The game is played on a square grid of dimension n: each grid
location is labelled (p, q) where 0  p < n and 0  q < n. Each grid location has on it a stack of
between 0 and 100 pennies.

A contestant begins by standing at location (0, 0). The contestant collects the money where he or
she stands and then jumps either horizontally or vertically to another square. That square must be
within the jumping capability of the contestant (say, k locations) and must have more pennies than
those that were on the current square.

Given n, k, and the number of pennies at each grid location, compute the maximum number of
pennies that the contestant can pick up before being unable to move.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

 a line containing two integers between 1 and 100: n and k

 n lines, each with n numbers: the first line contains the number of pennies at loca-
tions (0, 0), (0, 1), . . . , (0, n  1); the next line contains the number of pennies at locations
(1, 0), (1, 1), . . . , (1, n 1), and so on.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

 a single integer giving the number of pennies collected
