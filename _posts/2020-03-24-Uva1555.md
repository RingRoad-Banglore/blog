title: Uva 01555  Garland
---


## Input

```

The New Year garland consists of N lamps attached to a
common wire that hangs down on the ends to which out-
ermost lamps are affixed. The wire sags under the weight
of lamp in a particular way: each lamp is hanging at the
height that is 1 millimeter lower than the average height of
the two adjacent lamps.

The leftmost lamp in hanging at the height of Amillime-
ters above the ground. You have to determine the lowest
height B of the rightmost lamp so that no lamp in the gar-
land lies on the ground though some of them may touch the
ground.

You shall neglect the lamps size in this problem. By
numbering the lamps with integers from 1 to N and denot-
ing the i-th lamp height in millimeters as Hi we derive the
following equations:

 H1 = A

 Hi = (Hi1 +Hi+1)/2 1, for all 1 < i < N

 HN = B

 Hi  0, for all 1  i  N

The sample garland with 8 lamps that is shown on the
picture has A = 15 and B = 9.75.
```

## Output

```
The input file consists of several datasets. Each datasets
contains a single line with two numbers N and A separated
by a space. N (3  N  1000) is an integer representing
the number of lamps in the garland, A (10  A  1000) is
a real number representing the height of the leftmost lamp above the ground in millimeters.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset, write to the output file the single real number B accurate to two digits to the right
of the decimal point representing the lowest possible height of the rightmost lamp.
