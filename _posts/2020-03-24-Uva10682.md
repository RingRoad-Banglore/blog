title: Uva 10682  Forr Party
---


## Input

```
Chico loves to drive, always in high speeds. Another Chicos love is Forr, a kind of music very popular
in the Northeast Brazilian. But Chicos city doesnt have many Forr parties and he needs to travel to
other cities if he wishes to go to a Forr party.

Chico, besides driving and Forr dancing, also likes computers and programming. As he is a very
good programmer, he decides to make a program to calculate the best way to go from his city to a city
where will have a Forr party. But, unfortunately, Chico needs to go out with his girlfriend and can
not do the program, so he asked for your help.

But Chicos car has a problem with the brakes and he can not fix because if he does this he will not
have money to buy the partys ticket and drink some beers. So you should find a route where Chico
brakes only once, when he arrives in his destiny. Because he can not break, is dangerous pass by a city,
so Chico should through the minimum number of cities in his travel.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several input sets. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with one integer R (0 < R  5000), the number of roads. Next R lines describe
the roads and consist of two cities name, where each city name has at most 30 characters, and V
(0 < V  1000) the Chicos car velocity when Chico travels between the cities A and B. You can
assume that A and B are not the same city and can exist more than one road between two cities. After
this there is a line with two city names, the first is the city where Chico lives and the other is the city
where the Forr party will happen.

There will be at most 500 different cities. Input is terminated by EOF and there is a blank line
between two input sets.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input set you should print the route for Chico to go from his city to the Forr party city, with
a blank space between two cities, so he brakes only once and through the minimum number of cities. If
there is more than one route, print that where the cities appear first in the input (see the last input).
If there is no possible route print No valid route., without the quotes. Print a blank line between
the outputs. See the examples below for the exact input/output format.
