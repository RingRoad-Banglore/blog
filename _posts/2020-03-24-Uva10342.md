title: Uva 10342  Always Late

```
Ajmat Have you noticed one member of team 13 comes late in almost every contest?

Nejhum You mean the team of Mahbub, Moazzem and Yeamin? Whats the problem with them?

Ajmat All of them lives far away from BUET, and they always avoid the shortest path to BUET.

Nejhum Are you kidding? Why would they do so? A computer science student wont ever do that.

Ajmat They always avoids the shortest path. They believe that they always face the worst traffic jam
on their shortest way to BUET.

Nejhum That sounds crazy!

Ajmat They are more crazy than you think they are. They always try to use the path whose length
is smaller than or equal to that of any path to BUET except the shortest one. And for that, they
sometimes visit the same junction more than once.

Nejhum But they are not using the longest path. Then why are they late almost everyday?

Ajmat Thats because they have to spend a lot of time to find out which of the paths meet their
criteria. Perhaps they dont know how to find out the second-shortest path.

Nejhum I think we should solve this real problem in todays contest, instead of solving imaginary
ones.

Ajmat Lets try.
```

## Input

```
The first line of each test case contains two integers: n (the number of junctions, 1 < n < 100) and
r (the number of bi-directional roads connecting these junctions). The junctions are numbered with
0, 1, . . . n1. Each of the next r lines (one for each road) contains three integers: two junction-numbers
that the corresponding road connects and the length of the road in kilometers. The next line contains
an integer q, the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two junction-numbers. There is
a blank line after the q queries. There is at most 1 road between each junction pair. A road always
connects two different junctions. Length of a road is not less than 1km and not more than 100km.

Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Output

```
For each set of output, print the set # (1, 2, ) followed by q lines, one for each query, each containing
the length of the second-shortest path between the corresponding junctions. However, for the unsolvable
queries, print a ?.

```
