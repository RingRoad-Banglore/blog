title: Uva 13051  Enchanted Forest
---


## Input

```text
The forest of El-Dorado has been enchanted by dark magic. Rabbit wizards live in the forest but all
the paths among different wizards have been blocked by the magic. Zao, the lord of wizard rabbits,
wants to lift up the curse and clean up all the dark magic from the forest, so that all the rabbits can
reach each others houses again like they used to do in the past.

Therefore, he asked for your help. You will be given an adjacency matrix that represents whether
there is a bidirectional path between two rabbits or not. Determine the number of different sets of
paths that can be cleaned.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input is an integer T (1  T  100), where T is the number of test cases. For each
test case, first you will be given an integer n (1  n  15), the number of rabbits, followed by n strings
containing n characters each, where j-th character of i-th element is Y if theres a path between the
i-th rabbit and the j-th rabbit, or N otherwise. All paths are bidirectional.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a line in the following format: Case X: Y , where X is the number of test
case starting from 1 and Y is the number of different sets of paths that can be cleaned to achieve Zaos
goal. Since the number can be very big, output it in modulo 10000.
