title: Uva 12667  Last Blood
---


```

In many programming contests, special prizes are given to teams who solved a particular problem first.
We call the first accepted solution First Blood.

Its an interesting idea to set prizes for Last Blood. Then people wont submit their solutions
until the last minute. But this is dangerous: if the solution got Wrong Answer or even Time limit
exceeded, it may be too late to correct the solution.

You may argue that once a submission got Accepted, the team can send it again, but in this
problem, we only consider the earliest accepted solution of a team for each problem, so re-sending an
accepted solution does NOT help!

Given all the submissions in a contest, your task is to find out the Last Blood prizes for each
problem.
```

## Input

```
There is only one test case. The first line contains three integer n, t, m (5  n  12, 10  t  100,
1  m  1000), the number of problems, teams and submissions. Each of the following m lines describes
one submission: time (0  time  300), teamID (1 . . . t), problem (A ...L) and verdict(Yes or No).
Submissions are sorted in time order. That means for two submissions of the same time field, the
submission that comes later in the input is received later in the contest (maybe only a few seconds
later). No two submissions are received in exactly the same time.

```

## Output

```
For each problem, print the last bloods time and teamID.
