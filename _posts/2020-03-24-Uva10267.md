title: Uva 10267  Graphical Editor

## Input

```
The simple graphical editor deals with a rectangular table M N (1  M,N  250). Each pixel of the
table has its colour. The picture is formed from this square pixels.

The problem is to write a program, which simulates an interactive work of the graphical editor.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of the editor commands, one per line. Each command is represented by one Latin capital
placed in the very beginning of the line. If the command supposes parameters, all the parameters will
be given in the same line separated by space. As the parameters there may be: the coordinates of the
pixel - two integers, the first one is the column number and belongs to 1 . . .M , the second one is the
row number and belongs to 1 . . . N , the origin is in the upper left corner of the table; the colour - the
Latin capital; file name - in MSDOS 8.3 format.

The editor deals with the following commands:

I M N Creates a new table M  N . All the pixels are colored in
white (O).

C Clears the table. The size remains the same. All the pixels
became white (O).

L X Y C Colors the pixel with coordinates (X,Y ) in colour C.
V X Y1 Y2 C Draws the vertical segment in the column X between the

rows Y1 and Y2 inclusive in colour C.
H X1 X2 Y C Draws the horizontal segment in the row Y between the

columns X1 and X2 inclusive in colour C.
K X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C Draws the filled rectangle in colour C. (X1, Y1) is the upper

left corner, (X2, Y2) is the lower right corner of the rectangle.
F X Y C Fills the region with the colour C. The region R to be filled

is defined as follows. The pixel (X,Y ) belongs to this region.
The other pixel belongs to the region R if and only if it has
the same colour as pixel (X,Y ) and a common side with any
pixel which belongs to this region.

S Name Writes the picture in the file Name.
X Terminates the session.

```

## Sample Input

```
Every time the command S NAME meets, you should output the file name NAME and the current
table, row by row. Each row is represented by a pixels colours series, see the output sample.

Errors: If as a command there will be a character different from I, C, L, V, H, K, F, S, X, the
editor should ignore the whole line and pass to the next command.

In case of other errors the program behaviour is unpredictable.
