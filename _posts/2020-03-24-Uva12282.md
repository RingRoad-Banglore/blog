## Input

```
In this problem, we will play with four 2  2
squared pieces, an 8  8 board, few obstacles
and gravity(!!!).

Initially the board contains few obstacles
and the 4 colored pieces randomly placed. An
example of an initial configuration is shown in
the above diagram. The black squares repre-
sent the obstacles and the 4 colored pieces are
shown with labels A, B, C and D - (in order
to help the colorblind people). Initially there
is no gravity and thus the pieces remain at a
steady position. We can enable gravity in any
of the four directions to move the pieces. The
pieces move in the direction of gravity. A piece
continues to move until it hits an edge of the
board, an obstacle or any other piece. The ob-
stacles arent affected by gravity and so remains
in their initial position at all times. We can en-
able at most one gravity at a time. The gravitational direction can only be changed when all the
pieces are static.

The diagram to the left shows the positions of the pieces after the
gravity from the right is enabled.

How many different static states can be reached by enabling at least
one gravity? Two states are different if there is at least once cell that
has a different color. A static state is one in which all the pieces are
steady!
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T  100) that indicates the
number of test cases. Each case consists of 8 lines with 8 characters
in each line. Every character will be from the set {A, B, C, D, ., #}.

Dots(.) represent empty spaces, hashes(#) represent obstacles and the alphabets represents the pieces.
The frequencies of each letter (A,B,C,D) will be exactly 4 and each letter will occupy positions so that
they form squares of size 2 2. There is a blank line before every case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the case number followed by the number of different static states that can be
reached from the original position by enabling at least one gravity.
