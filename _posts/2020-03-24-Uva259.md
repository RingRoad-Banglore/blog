title: Uva 00259  Software Allocation
---


## Input

```
A computing center has ten different computers (numbered 0 to 9) on which applications can run. The
computers are not multi-tasking, so each machine can run only one application at any time. There are
26 applications, named A to Z. Whether an application can run on a particular computer can be found
in a job description (see below).

Every morning, the users bring in their applications for that day. It is possible that two users bring
in the same application; in that case two different, independent computers will be allocated for that
application.

A clerk collects the applications, and for each different application he makes a list of computers on
which the application could run. Then, he assigns each application to a computer. Remember: the
computers are not multi-tasking, so each computer must handle at most one application in total. (An
application takes a day to complete, so that sequencing i.e. one application after another on the same
machine is not possible.)

A job description consists of

1. one upper case letter A...Z, indicating the application.

2. one digit 1...9, indicating the number of users who brought in the application.

3. a blank (space character.)

4. one or more different digits 0...9, indicating the computers on which the application can run.

5. a terminating semicolon ;.

6. an end-of-line.
```

## Output

```
The input for your program is a textfile. For each day it contains one or more job descriptions, separated
by a line containing only the end-of-line marker. The input file ends with the standard end-of-file marker.
For each day your program determines whether an allocation of applications to computers can be done,
and if so, generates a possible allocation.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output is also a textfile. For each day it consists of one of the following:

 ten characters from the set {A ... Z, _}, indicating the applications allocated to computers
0 to 9 respectively if an allocation was possible. An underscore _ means that no application is
allocated to the corresponding computer.

 a single character !, if no allocation was possible.
