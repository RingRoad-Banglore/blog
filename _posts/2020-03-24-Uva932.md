title: Uva 00932  Checking the NQueens Problem
---


## Input

```

The eight-queens problem consists of finding (if it exists) a configuration for a set of eight queens on
a chessboard, in such a way that no queen is under attack by any other. In other words, there must
be a single queen in each row and column of the board, and at most one queen in each diagonal line.
The N -queens problem is the obvious generalization of this problem to an N N board. Consider for
instance the following two configurations; the first is a solution to the 5-queens problem and the second
is not:

Your task is to write a program that, for a given N , determines whether a configuration is a solution
to the N -queens problem. If not, the program will then check if a solution can be obtained by moving
a single queen (in any of the eight possible directions). To simplify, consider that queens can move over
each other, i.e, a queen can be moved to any empty position in the same row, column, or diagonal line
where it stands.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases, each of which has:

 a line containing the dimension N of the problem (a positive integer number not greater than 30),
followed by

 N lines, each consisting of N characters followed by newline. Characters can only be 0 (zero, cor-
responding to an empty position) or (capital) X, corresponding to a queen. Each line corresponds
to a row in the board.

 will contain exactly N occurrences of the character X.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output for each test case will consist of one of the following:

 a single line containing the word YES (if the configuration is a solution to the N -queens problem)

 otherwise, a line containing the word NO, followed by a line containing either:

 the word NO, if no solution can be obtained by moving one queen; or

 the word YES followed byN lines corresponding to the description of the solution discovered,
in the same format as in the input.

Print a blank line between test cases.
