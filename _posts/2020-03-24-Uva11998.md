```
I love a game series called Wario Land, so Id like to make a very difficult

(indeed!!!) problem about it :) A big thank you goes to Erjin Zhou, for the idea and

reference code. And a small thank you goes to Wenbin Tang, for reminding me that

Rujia Liu also contains the letter L!

Suppose there are n places in the very beginning of Wario Land. The land was almost deprecated,
so it does not have any roads at all! Youll be given m operations. Execute them one by one, and
output the results.

1 x y Wario wants to build a direct road between place x and y. If x and y
are already connected (directly or indirectly), ignore this command
(because Wario thinks its a waste of time!).

2 x y Change place xs treasure value to v. This is due to newly discovered
treasures, or treasures that are stolen by someone else.

3 x y v Among the places along the path between x and y (including x and
y), how many of them have treasure value  v? Wario also needs
the product of these treasure values, modulo k (see below).
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases. In each test case, the first line contains three integers n, m, k
(1  n  50, 000, 1  m  100, 000, 2  k  33333). Places are numbered from 1 to n. The second
line contains n integers V [i] (1  V [i]  k), the initial treasure values of each place. Each of the next
m lines contains an operation. For each operation, 1  x, y  n, 1  v  k. The input is terminated
by end-of-file (EOF).

```

## Output

```
For each type-3 operation, output the number of places and the product of their treasure values, modulo
k. If there is no path between x and y, or every place along the path has treasure value > v, output a
single 0 (rather than 0 0 or 0 1).

Obfuscation
In order to prevent you from preprocessing the operations, we adopt the following obfuscation

scheme:

Each type-1 operation becomes 1 x+ d y + d
Each type-2 operation becomes 2 x+ d v + d
Each type-3 operation becomes 3 x+ d y + d v + d

Where d is the last integer that you output, before processing this operation. If you havent output
anything yet, d = 0.

After the obfuscation, the sample input would be:

4 8 39
2 3 4 5
