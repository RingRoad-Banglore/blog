```
Puzzles with geometric shapes are very interesting and is said to have great impact in developing
geometric insight of a child. ACM (Actual Challenge Makers) is planning to bring out one such puzzle.
The specialty of this puzzle is that all the pieces of this puzzle have the shape of right-angled triangles.
All these right angled pieces make the target rectangular shape and it is shown in figure 2.

It may be a bit difficult to construct or even reconstruct a puzzle which is only composed of pieces
with the shape of a right-angled triangle. However if the actual rectangular puzzle is divided into
several square sub-regions, and then those sub-regions are divided into four right-angled pieces then
such puzzles are easy to make and solve.

Figure 1: A cut to make four right
angled triangle shaped pieces.

Figure 2: A conventional puzzle of triangles.

Whether a rectangle can be divided into small pieces of squares can itself be an interesting task
to solve. But that is not the problem you have to solve here. Your job is to decide whether a square
shaped sheet can be divided into four right-angled triangles as shown in figure 1. The machine that is
used to cut the pieces can only deal with integers. So the length of the square shaped sheets is always
expressed in integer units and also cutter can only cut in a straight line from one integer coordinate to
another. The cutting must start on one of the corners of the square shaped sheet, continue cutting in
a triangular path (Like AEF showed in Figure 1) and again finish at the corner it started. And if four
corners of the square sheet are lattice points (0, 0), (N, 0), (N,N) and (0, N), where N is the length of
sides of the square shaped sheet then point E and F should also be lattice points. So given a sheet, you
have to determine whether such cuts are possible, and if it is possible then in how many ways.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 800 lines of inputs.

Each line contains an integer N (0 < N < 1014), which means that we have to cut an (N  N)
sheet.

Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. This zero should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by
a string or an integer. If it is not possible to cut the (N N) sheet in the prescribed way, then print
a line Impossible, otherwise print an integer W . Here W denotes the number of ways such a cut is
possible. Look at the output for sample input for details
