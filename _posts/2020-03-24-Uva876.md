title: Uva 00876  Balanced Expressions
---


```
Let us consider expressions formed by nonnegative integers, the unary operator -, the binary operators
+, -, * and / and the symbols ( and ).

Two expressions E and F are isomorphic if E can be obtained from F by replacing some nonnegative
integers by others. The expressions (2+3)  6 (4) and (7+0)  6 (8) are isomorphic, but neither
of them is isomorphic to (2 + 3)  6 (4).

An expression E is balanced if every binary operation in it is applied to two isomorphic expressions.
The expressions 5, (1 + 2)  (3 + 5) and ((3)/(4))/((1)/(100)) are balanced, while 12 + (3 2)
is not.

Given an expression E, check whether it is balanced.
