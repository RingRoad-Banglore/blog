title: Uva 13267  Half the Polygon
---


## Input

```
An orthogonal polygon has the property that all of its edge intersections are at right angles. Thus
the interior angle at each vertex is either 90or 270. Given an orthogonal simple polygon (non-self
intersecting or touching) with integer coordinates, determine if it can be cut exactly in half with a
horizontal or vertical segment, such that we end up dividing the polygon into two identical polygons.
Two polygons are considered identical if one can be transformed into the other using some combination
of reflections, rotations and translations.

Also, the endpoints of the dividing segment must also be integers.
```

## Output

```
A number of of inputs ( 50), each starting with one integer n (4  n  100000) on a line, the number
vertices in the polygon. This is followed by n lines, each with the x, y (0  x, y  109) coordinates
indicating a vertex on the polygon (listed in order, such that connecting them in order yields the
polygon).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input, output Yes, if the polygon can be split in half with a, vertical or horizontal, cut and
No otherwise.
