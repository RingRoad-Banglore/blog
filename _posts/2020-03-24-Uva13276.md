```
Have you heard about Megamind? Megamind and Metro Man are two aliens
who came to earth. Megamind wanted to destroy the earth, while Metro Man
wanted to stop him and protect mankind. After a lot of fighting, Megamind
finally threw Metro Man up into the sky. Metro Man was defeated and  was 
 never  seen  again.

Megamind wanted to be a super villain. He believed that the difference
between a villain and a super villain is nothing but presentation. Megamind
became bored, as he had nobody or nothing to fight against since Metro Man
was gone. So, he wanted to create another hero against whom he would fight
for recreation. But accidentally, another villain named Hal Stewart was
created in the process, who also wanted to destroy the earth.

Also, at some point Megamind had fallen in love with a pretty girl named
Roxanne Ritchi. This changed him into a new man. Now he wants to stop
Hal  Stewart  for  the  sake  of  his  love.  So,  the  ultimate  fight  starts  now.

 Megamind has unlimited supply of guns named  Magic-48 . Each of
these  guns  has K  rounds  of  magic  spells.

 Megamind has perfect aim. If he shoots a magic spell it will definitely
hit Hal Stewart. Once hit, it decreases the energy level of Hal Stewart 
 by P  units.

 However, since there is exactly K rounds of magic spells in each of these
guns, he may need to swap an old gun with a fully loaded one. This
takes some time. Lets call it  swapping period .

 Since Hal Stewart is a mutant, he has regeneration power. His energy level increases by R unit 
 during  a  swapping  period .

 Hal  Stewart  will  be  defeated  immediately  once  his  energy  level  becomes  zero  or  negative.

 Hal Stewart initially has the energy level of E and Megamind has a fully loaded gun in his hand.

 Given the values of E, P , K and R, find the minimum number of times Megamind needs to shoot 
 to  defeat  Hal  Stewart.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  defeat  him,  report  that  as  well.

For the sake of clarity, lets take an example. Suppose,  E = 13 ,  P = 4 ,  K = 3 and  R = 1 . There
are 3 rounds of spells in the gun. Megamind shoots all of them. Hal Stewarts energy level decreases by
12 units, and thus his energy level becomes 1. Since Megaminds gun is now empty, he will get a new
gun and thus its a  swapping period . At this time, Hal Stewarts energy level will increase by 1 unit and
will become 2. However, when Megamind shoots the next spell, Hals energy level will drop by 4 units
and will become 2, thus defeating him. So it takes 4 shoots in total to defeat Hal Stewart. However,
in this same example if Hals regeneration power was 50 instead of 1, it would have been impossible  to 
 defeat  Hal.

```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer  T (T  105 ) on a line by itself indicating the number of
the cases. Each of the next T lines contains four space separated integers E , P , K and R respectively, 
 where,  1  E,P,K,R  105 .

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the test case number followed by the number of times Megamind needs to
shoot magic spell. If it is  impossible  to defeat Hal Stewart, output  -1 instead. You should follow
the exact  format  as  the  sample  input/output.
