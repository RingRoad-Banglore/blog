title: Uva 00575  Skew Binary
---


## Input

```
When a number is expressed in decimal, the k-th digit represents a multiple of 10k. (Digits are numbered
from right to left, where the least significant digit is number 0.) For example,

8130710 = 8 104 + 1 103 + 3 102 + 0 101 + 7 100 = 80000 + 1000 + 300 + 0 + 7 = 81307.

When a number is expressed in binary, the k-th digit represents a multiple of 2k. For example,

100112 = 1 24 + 0 23 + 0 22 + 1 21 + 1 20 = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 19.

In skew binary, the k-th digit represents a multiple of 2k+11. The only possible digits are 0 and
1, except that the least-significant nonzero digit can be a 2. For example,

10120skew = 1 (251)+0 (241)+1 (231)+2 (221)+0 (211) = 31+0+7+6+0 = 44.

The first 10 numbers in skew binary are 0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 20, 100, 101, and 102. (Skew binary is
useful in some applications because it is possible to add 1 with at most one carry. However, this has
nothing to do with the current problem.)
```

## Output

```
The input file contains one or more lines, each of which contains an integer n. If n = 0 it signals the
end of the input, and otherwise n is a nonnegative integer in skew binary.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each number, output the decimal equivalent. The decimal value of n will be at most 231  1 =
2147483647.
