title: Uva 00863  Process Scheduling
---


```
In batch programming, there are many tasks that need to be completed in minimal overall time.
Accurate information about the total runtime and interdependencies of processes is often available to
the scheduler, allowing optimal schedulings to be found. This problem considers processes that can
run on different CPUs at the same time, but which are interdependent. That is to say, some processes
cannot start until others have completed. Scheduling processes optimally prevents CPUs from being
idle unnecessarily.

Your task is to find a way of using n processors to run p processes, minimizing the number of time
slices until they are all finished. Some processes may be dependent on processes that depend on other
processes, but there will be no dependency loops.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first line of input will consist of two integers, the number of processors (n) and the number of
processes (p). Both numbers will be positive; p < 100 and n < 21.

There will be p additional lines representing the processes. Each of these lines will contain an
integer representing the number of CPU time slices required for the process and zero or more integers
representing the processes that must finish before this process may start. Processes are numbered from
1 to p.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

Output consists of n columns of width two, with a single space between columns. The i-th line
corresponds to the processes running during the i-th time slice. The process numbers should be right-
justified. The scheduling of processes should minimize the amount of time until all of the processes
have completed their tasks. Trailing spaces are acceptable, provided that they do not extend beyond
the right of the last column.
