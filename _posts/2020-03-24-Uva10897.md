title: Uva 10897  Travelling Distance

## Input

```text
In geography, you have probably learned that locations on Earth are represented by latitude and
longitude. Lines of latitude run in the same direction as the Equator. Latitudes start at the Equator,
which is 0, representing the North-South direction. The range of latitudes is 180: from 90N (North
Pole) to 0, and from 0 to 90S (South Pole). Lines of longitude run from North Pole to South Pole.
Longitudes start at the meridian of Greenwich, which is 0, representing the East-West direction. The
range of longitudes is 360: from 180E to 0, and from 0 to 180W . Therefore 180E is the same as
180W .

Latitudes and longitudes use degrees as their unit. Degrees use minutes and seconds instead of plain
decimal digits. 1 degree has 60 minutes, and 1 minute has 60 seconds. Only seconds have decimal digits.
For example, Kingston, Ontario, is located at 4416N , 7630W , and Toronto, Ontario, is located at
4341N , 7938W .

Assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere, the mean radius of the Earth is 6371.01 km. If you are given
the latitude and longitude of two locations, can you find out the minimum walking distance between
the two locations?
```

## Output

```text
The input starts with a line containing a number n, which is the number of pairs of locations, followed
by n lines. Each line consists of the position of the two locations, separated by a space. Positions are
in the format of:

a b c X d e f Y

The first four represent the latitude. X is either the character N or S, and the latitude is abcX
(a degrees, b minutes, and c seconds). The next four represent the longitude. Y is either the character
E or W, and the longitude is def Y . Each is separated by a space. a, b, d, e are integers, while c
and f are floating point numbers with two decimal digits.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of n lines, each lines contain a number with two decimal digits, in km, the minimum
surface distance between the two locations on Earth. Note that you must travel on the surface of the
Earth. You can assume that there is no mountain between the two places.
