## Input

```
Toby was behaving badly at little dog school and his teacher grounded him by asking him to solve a
hard problem. Toby is given a number N , lets consider a set S of all binary strings of N bits. Lets
also consider any subset Pi of S, let XOR(Pi) be the XOR of all the elements of Pi. The XOR of the
empty set is a binary string of N zeros.

As Toby is a very smart dog, and Tobys teacher wants Toby to spend a very long time working on
the problem, he asks:

How many different subsets Pi of S exist such than XOR(Pi) has exactly K ones?

Recall that the empty set and S itself are valid subsets of S.
```

## Output

```
The input consist of several test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing the numbers N and
K. The end of the test cases is given by the end of file (EOF).

 1  K  N  106

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print the requested answer modulo p = 109 + 7.

Explication:
For the first test case the subsets of the strings of 2 bits with an XOR with zero ones is: {}, {00},

{01, 10, 11} and {00, 01, 10, 11}
For the second test case the subsets of the strings of 1 bit with an XOR with one is: {1}, {0, 1}

```

## Sample Output

```
2 0
1 1

```
