title: Uva 10980  Lowest Price in Town
---


```
It is sometimes tricky to figure out the cheapest way to buy things, even in the supermarket where the
price of all goods are listed clearly. Just consider what I saw last Saturday about the price of cooking
oil: (notice the difference in the sizes of the two price tags)

Having a sharp mind (a consequence of regularly taking part in online programming contests), you
should have no problem in seeing that the buy-1-get-1-free scheme is preferable. But what about your
Mum? It is your responsibility as her son/daughter to write her a program that computes the lowest
price to buy things in the supermarket, thus helps her to save money.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of more than a hundred test cases, each concerning a different item. The first line of
each case gives the unit price of buying an item, then a non-negative integer M ( 20). This is followed
by M lines each containing two numbers N and P (1 < N  100), which means that you can buy N
such items for $P . Finally there is a line containing a list of positive integers K ( 100).

```

## Output

```
For each of them your program should print the lowest price you need to get K items. Note that you
do not have to buy exactly K items; you may consider buying more than K items, and giving the
unneeded items to your dear neighbours, if you can save money in this way.

Note that all prices P given in the input are floating-point numbers in exactly 2 decimal places,
with 0 < P < 1000.
