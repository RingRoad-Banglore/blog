title: Uva 11220  Decoding the message
---


## Input

```
Chico and Maria are relatives that live in different towns. As they inhabit a rural area, it is very
difficult for them to keep in touch. One way they found to overcome their communication problem was
to send a line through their parents that used to visit each other.

The point is that Chico and Maria did not want that their parents read their messages, and they
decided to create a secret code for the messages. The code is not very sophisticated, but you should
keep in mind Chico and Maria are just children.

In general, the meaning of a message is based on a letter of each word, in a way that they will form a
message with the first letter of the first word, the second letter of the second word and so on. If a word
does not have enough letters, the following word should be used. For example, if you are analyzing the
third word, you should consider its third letter, but if it just has two letters, then you should try to
form a decoded word with the third letter of the fourth word.

When the end of a line is reached, you should finish the current decoded word and should start to
form another one from the first letter of the first word in the next line.

Your task is to translate a message according to Chico and Marias secret code.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, T (1  T  30), then there is a blank line before the
first test case. Each test case represents a message, which is composed by 1  N  100 lines and each
line is composed by 1  M  30 words. Two words in the same line are separated by one or more white
spaces. A word is formed by the letters A-Z and a-z and has at most 30 letters. The only symbols that
appear in the input are the alphabetic letters and white spaces. There will be a blank line after each
message.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case you must print the number of the test case and each word of the decoded message,
one per line (look the sample output for the exact format). You must print a blank line between each
test case.
