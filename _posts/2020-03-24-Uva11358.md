title: Uva 11358  Faster Processing Feasibility
---


## Input

```
The era of technology is so hectic at times! Each & every single day, the crying needs for faster & faster
processors are becoming more important than before with the continuously increasing complexity of
applications & tasks. One of the solutions that the processor manufacturers are successfully employing
nowadays is parallel processing. Scheduling of tasks is a prime concern while designing faster processors
having several components working in parallel. We are currently building a new microprocessor that has
P logical sub-processors in it. Each of the logical sub-processors can act as an individual processor &
process one of the available tasks during a time slot. Note that, a logical sub-processor can process only
a single task in one time slot & a task can not be processed by more than one processor during a time
slot. Now, you are given the arrival time (the time when a task becomes available to the processors),
processing time (the number of time slots necessary to complete processing the task) & deadline (the
earliest time when the processing of this task is required to be completed) for T tasks. You have to
figure out if it is possible to schedule the tasks using the available resources in such a way that all tasks
are completed before their respective deadlines.

Let us be a bit more specific. From now on we shall assume, each time slot equals 1 micro-second.
The span of the first time slot is 0 to 1 micro-second while the second time slot is 1 to 2 micro-second
& so on.

For example, consider a multi-processor system with 2 logical sub-processors. You are needed to
schedule 3 tasks A, B & C with the following data.

Task Arrival Time Processing Time Deadline
A 0 2 2
B 0 3 4
C 1 2 3

It is possible to schedule these 3 tasks in the given system so that all the tasks meet their respective
deadlines i.e. processing of task A, B & C are completed at (or before) time 2 micro-second, 4 micro-
second and 3 micro-second respectively. Look at the following table for a possible schedule.

Time Available Assigned to Assigned to Completed Due
(micro-second) tasks processor -1 processor -2 tasks tasks

0 A,B A B - -
1 A,B,C A C - -
2 B,C B C A A
3 B B - A,C A,C
4 - - - A,C,B A,C,B
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input is the number of test cases C (1  C  50). C test cases follow. A test case
begins with 2 integers P (1  P  40) and T (1  T  40), as described earlier. Each of the next
T lines gives a task detail. A task detail consists of 3 integers  arrival time, Ai (0  Ai  1000),
processing time, Ri (1  Ri  5000) and deadline, Di(Ai +Ri  Di  10000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print FEASIBLE in a line if there is a possible schedule to meet all the deadlines.
Otherwise, print NO WAY.
