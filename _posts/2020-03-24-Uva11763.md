```
Its the Wild West. But things are not quite well here, now. Last few months, many trains have been
robbed by the mysterious and vicious bandit called El Diablo. The railroad company has offered a
reward of about $150000 for the one who can stop him. Thats why John Cooper is trying to catch
him.

But the task is not that easy as it looks. Thats why John made a team and planned to chase after
the El Diablo. After a lot of hard work and with mild plans, they finally managed to surround him
in a room. But the problem is that the only door of the room is locked and it cant be unlocked other
than finding a combination.

There are n stones scattered outside the room. Each of them is equal in size but labeled by an
integer number. The door has n holes numbered from 1 to n. Any hole can contain at most one stone.
In the upper side of the door, m pairs of integers are written. Each of them denotes a range of some
consecutive holes.

John is trying to arrange the stones in the holes such that, the maximum difference of the maximum
labeled stone and the minimum labeled stone in any range is minimized. If John can place them in the
best possible way, then the door will be unlocked.

El Diablo will escape if it takes more than 5 hours. Cause he is digging a hole which leads to a cave.
If he reaches the cave, all the plans and hark works will be in vain, because he can escape through the
cave. Thats why John is seeking your help. Since John is not a programmer, he asks you to write a
program which will solve this problem and unlock the door. So, Hats off to you for helping John. May
be you will get a share of the reward if you can unlock the door.

## Input

```
First line of the input will contain the number of cases T ( 300). Then T cases follow.
Each case will start with an integer n (1  n  30). The next line will contain n integers denoting

the labels of the stones. The next line will contain an integer m (1  m  5). Each of the next m lines
will contain two integers a b (1  a  b  n) denoting all the holes from a to b (inclusive). Each of the
integers will be fit into a 32 bit signed integer.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the case number and the desired result as shown below.
