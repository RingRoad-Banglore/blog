title: Uva 11859  Division Game
---


## Input

```
Division game is a 2-player game. In this game, there is a matrix of positive integers with N rows
and M columns. Players make their moves in turns. In each step, the current player selects a row.
If the row contains all 1s, the player looses. Otherwise, the player can select any number of integers
(but at least 1 and each of them should be greater than 1) from that row and then divides each of
the selected integers with any divisor other than 1. For example, 6 can be divided by 2, 3 and 6, but
cannot be divided by 1, 4 and 5. The player who first makes the matrix all 1s wins. In other words, if
in his/her move, player gets the matrix with all 1s, then he/she looses. Given the matrix, your task is
to determine whether the first player wins or not. Assume that both of the players will play perfectly
to win.
```

## Output

```
The first line has a positive integer T , T  50, denoting the number of test cases. This is followed by
each test case per line.

Each test case starts with a line containing 2 integers N and M representing the number of rows
and columns respectively. Both N and M are between 1 and 50 inclusive. Each of the next N line each
contains M integers. All these integers are between 2 and 10000 inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output contains a line in the format Case #x: M , where x is the case number
(starting from 1) and M is YES when the first player has a winning strategy and NO otherwise.
