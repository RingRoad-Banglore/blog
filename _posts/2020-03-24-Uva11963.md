title: Uva 11963  Emigration

## Input

```
Lithuanian migration department has announced that approximately 90 thousand Lithuanians will have
emigrated by the end of 2010. This is many times more than any other European country and if no
measures will be taken the whole population will be subject to extinction.

The department is investigating possible ways of attracting Lithuanians back to their country, and
most importantly reduce existing emigration. The next step of the investigation includes consolidation
of data received from Lithuanian embassies across the world, in order to identify the regions where
Lithuanians have migrated: United Kingdom, Norway, Ireland among others.

To identify what measures are best the following poll was arranged in some of the countries. People
where asked to choose what government activity can bring them home. Each activity i has associated
cost X in litas. Total cost to implement the activity consists of fixed and variable costs. Fixed cost
is the same for all countries. Variable cost depends on the number of emigrants in that particular
country. You also know that activity i has efficiency E, given in percent, meaning that E% emigrants
will be attracted back home. Efficiency can be different for different countries. Each activity is always
implemented to all people in a country, but only some will return back home to Lithuania.

Given that no effective activity compensating emigration has been found so far the government has
decided to diversify the activities and implement each activity at most in 1 country, to mitigate the
risk of missing potentially undervalued activities. However, different activities can be implemented in
different countries, but no more then one per country. You are asked to find the number of Lithuanians
that can be attracted back home according to the poll results.

## Output

```
On the first line of input you are given a number of tests T (T  100). Each test starts with a line
containing 3 positive integers separated by a space character: K (K  5)  number of activities, N
(N  10)  number of countries, M (M  1000)  money that government can spend on activities in
millions of litas. Then data about activities follow containing K lines. Each line describes an activity
contains 1 upper-case latin alphabet letter (activity name) and 2 positive integers: Cp  fixed cost
in thousands of litas, Cv variable cost per person in litas. First line of data for each country specifies
the number of activities Ki  K applicable to that country, and Pi (Pi  106)  the number of
emigrants in that country. Ki lines follow each specifying the activity index, and an integer number
specifying efficiency of the activity in percent of countrys population. When calculating number of
people attracted by activity in a country round to the nearest integer, and if needed half up.
