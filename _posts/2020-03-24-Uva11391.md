title: Uva 11391  Blobs in the Board
---


## Input

```
You are given a board consists of R rows and C columns. There are N blobs in the board. Each cell
of the board might or might not contain a blob. A cell can have at most 8 adjacent cells. A blob can
jump over any adjacent blobs to the next empty cell. Thus a blob can jump straight to two squares
at any of the 8 directions if the destination cell is empty and the cell between the source cell and the
destination cell contains a blob. Blobs cannot jump outside of the board. After the jump the blob in
the middle cell of the jump will be removed. The goal is to make jumps carefully so that after N-1
jumps only one blob remains. Your task is to count how many ways the goal can be achieved.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several test cases. The first line of the input file contains a single integer T indicating
the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case starts with three positive integers R,
C and N . Each of the next N lines contain two integers x, y where i-th line contains the row position
x and column position y of the i-th blob. No two blobs share the same cell.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input produce one line of output Case x: n, where x indicates the test case number
(starting from 1) and n the number of ways the goal can be achieved.
