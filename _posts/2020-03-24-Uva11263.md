## Input

```
Sultan has a rectangle of R rows and C columns. Each cell of this rectangle contains an integer.
Sultan chooses n subrectangles. The i-th subrectangle has Ri rows and Ci columns and it is nested
inside (i 1)-th subrectangle. The first subrectangle is nested inside the initial rectangle. Sultan then
multiplies all the integers outside the first subrectangle with M0. Then he multiplies all the integers
inside ith rectangle but outside (i+ 1)-th rectangle with Mi. Then he multiples all the integers inside
n-th subrectangle with Mn. So he get a new rectangle of integers. The sum of all the integers of this
new rectangle is S. Help Sultan to choose all this subrectangles in such a way so that S is maximized.

In the above figure, the outer most portion (that is not contained in any of the sub rectangle) is
multiplied by M0, the portion inside the first rectangle, but outside the second one by M1, portion
inside 2nd and outside 3rd by M2, and so forth. The portion inside the n-th sub rectangle is multiplied
by Mn.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains T ( 20) the number of test cases. First line of the each test case
contains 3 integers R (1  R  500), C (1  C  500) and n (1  n  5). Second line contains
n integers R1, R2, . . . , Rn (R > R1 > R2 > . . . > Rn). Third line contains n integers C1, C2, , Cn
(C > C1 > C2 > . . . > Cn). The values Ri, Ci describes the dimensions of the i-th sub rectangle.
Fourth line contains n + 1 integers M0,M1, . . . ,Mn (10  Mi  10), the values of each multiplier.
Lines 5 to line 4 + R each contain C integers. The j-th integer in the (i + 4)-th line is the number in
the i-th row and j-th column of the initial rectangle. All the integers in the initial rectangle is between
-100 to +100 inclusive.

```
