title: Uva 10053  Envelopes
---


```
I have bought some greeting cards for my friends but in order to send them I must also buy some
envelopes. Each card must be put inside a separate envelope without bending or tearing. The envelopes
are made of so thin papers that one can put inside an envelope a card having even the same dimensions
as that envelope.

Please help me choose envelopes so that the total amount I need to spend in buying them is
minimized.
```

## Input

```
The input may contain multiple test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers M (1  M  5) and N (M  N  10) where M
is the number of greeting cards and N is the number of envelopes to choose from. The i th (1  i  M)
of the next M lines consists of two integers li and wi (1  li, wi  50000) giving the dimensions of
the i th greeting card. The i th (1  i  N) of the next N lines contains three integers Li, Wi and Ci
(1  Li,Wi, Ci  50000) where Li and Wi give the dimensions of the i th envelope and Ci is its price in
Taka.

The input terminates with two zeros for M and N .

```

## Output

```
For each test case in the input first print the test case number on a separate line as shown in the sample
output. If an envelope can be chosen for each of the greeting cards in the input, print one line for each
where the i th line contains the number of the envelope (in the order given in the input) inside which
the i th greeting card should be put. Otherwise, print cannot buy on a line by itself. Note that if
there are multiple solutions with minimum cost, any one of them is acceptable.

Print a blank line between two successive test cases.
