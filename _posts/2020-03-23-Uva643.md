643 Bulk Mailing
An organization that wishes to make a large mailing can save postage by following U.S. Postal Service
rules for a bulk mailing. Letters in zip code order are bundled into packets of 10-15 letters each. Bundles
may consist of letters in which all 5 digits of zip code are the same (5-digit bundles), or they may consist
of letters in which only the first 3 digits of zip code are the same (3-digit bundles). If there are fewer
than 10 letters to make up a bundle of either type, those letters are mailed first class.

## Input
You are to write a program to read a data set of 5-digit zip codes, one per line, until end of file.

Your program should count the number of 5-digit bundles, 3-digit bundles, and first class letters.
You should include as many letters as possible in 5-digit bundles first, then as many as possible in
3-digit bundles, with as few bundles of 10 to 15 letters as possible. For example, if there are 31 letters
with the same zip code, they must be combined into exactly three 5-digit bundles. If there are 16 letters
and you have to make a 3-digit bundle, you should combine the 15 with lowest zip code.

Not all zip codes in the data set will be valid. A valid zip code consists of exactly 5 digits (0-9), all
of which cannot be 0. Non-numeric characters are not allowed. At the end of your output, print the
invalid zip codes found. (Duplicates need only be printed once.)

## Output
Print a report that lists 5-digit zip code bundles first, with the number of letters and number of bundles
for each zip code. Next list all 3-digit zip code bundles with the same two counts, followed by all zip
codes that are not bundled and to be sent first class. At the end print totals of letters and bundles,
followed by a list of invalid zip codes. Single space the report, and print blank lines following the
heading, before the total line, and between the three groups of zip codes.

For 3-digit bundles, print the zip codes in the form ‘dddxx’, where ddd represents the three significant
digits and ‘xx’ represents the last two digits to be omitted.

Your output should be similar to that shown in the sample. Valid zip codes should be printed in
ascending order, and invalid zip codes should be printed in the order in which they appear in the input.
