## Input

```text

Jump(10,2) = [2,4,6,8,10,3,7,1,9,5]

Integers 1, 2, 3, . . . , n are placed on a circle in the increasing or-
der as in the following figure. We want to construct a sequence
from these numbers on a circle. Starting with the number 1,
we continually go round by picking out each k-th number and
send to a sequence queue until all numbers on the circle are ex-
hausted. This linearly arranged numbers in the queue are called
Jump(n, k) sequence where 1  n, k.

Let us compute Jump(10, 2) sequence.
The first 5 picked numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 as shown in

the following figure. And 3, 7, 1, 9 and 5 will follow. So
we get Jump(10, 2) = [2,4,6,8,10,3,7,1,9,5]. In a similar way,
we can get easily Jump(13, 3) = [3,6,9,12,2,7,11,4,10,5,1,8,13],
Jump(13, 10) = [10,7,5,4,6,9,13,8,3,12,1,11,2] and Jump(10, 19)
= [9,10,3,8,1,6,4,5,7,2].

You write a program to print out the last three numbers of Jump(n, k) for n, k given. For example
suppose that n = 10, k = 2, then you should print 1, 9 and 5 on the output file. Note that Jump(1, k) =
[1].
```

## Output

```text
Your program is to read the input from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number
of test cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing two
integers n and k, where 5  n  500, 000 and 2  k  500, 000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Your program is to write to standard output. Print the last three numbers of Jump(n, k) in the order
of the last third, second and the last first.

```

## Sample Output
