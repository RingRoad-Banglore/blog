## Input

```
Graph is a collection of edges E and vertices V. Graph has a wide variety of applications in computer.
There are different ways to represent graph in computer. It can be represented by adjacency matrix or
by adjacency list. There are some other ways to represent graph. One of them is to write the degrees
(the numbers of edges that a vertex has) of each vertex. If there are n vertices then n integers can
represent that graph. In this problem we are talking about simple graph which does not have same
endpoints for more than one edge, and also does not have edges with the same endpoint.

Any graph can be represented by n number of integers. But the reverse is not always true. If you
are given n integers, you have to find out whether this n numbers can represent the degrees of n vertices
of a graph.
```

## Output

```
Each line will start with the number n ( 10000). The next n integers will represent the degrees of n
vertices of the graph. A 0 input for n will indicate end of input which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
If the n integers can represent a graph then print Possible. Otherwise print Not possible. Output
for each test case should be on separate line.

```

## Sample Output

```
4 3 3 3 3
6 2 4 5 5 2 1
5 3 2 3 2 1
0

```
