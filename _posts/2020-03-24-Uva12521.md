title: Uva 12521  Teamface
---


## Input

```
Teamface is the new social network from NewPie High School, whose purpose is to increase collaboration
among team members from all their sport teams. This new application is one of the new actions taken
to conquer all national championships and ratify NewPies place as the top school in the country.

In Teamface, members of teams can befriend each other under the following rules:

1. There are N students in NewPie teams (N > 0), identified with numbers 1, 2, , N .

2. A student can belong to only one of the T NewPie teams (T > 0).

3. All teams have the same number of members, M (2  M  N).

4. Every team has exactly one captain (one of its members).

5. All members of a given team are Teamface friends among them. They can share strategies,
post-match comments and watch replays online.

6. A student must have less than M/2 friends not in his/her team (this is meant to prevent
distractions).

Following the NewPie honor code, all players are registered in Teamface and have added their friends
according to these rules.

This years sponsors have requested the list of players for each team in order to send the training
uniforms for the next training session, to be held on Monday. They need a list that contains, for each
team, the number of training uniforms of each size. Information about team names and team captains
was received correctly, but due to an administrative error at NewPie, the players information was
apparently incomplete. Indeed, NewPie sent, for each player, his/her identifier, size, and a list with the
Teamface friends identifiers.

Today is Saturday afternoon and nobody at NewPie can answer any question. But your boss,
one of the NewPie sponsors, realized that it is possible to build the required list without any further
information. He has chosen you to do this as soon as possible.

## Output

```
There are several cases to solve. Each case begins with a line with two integer numbers T and N ,
indicating the number of teams and the number of students, respectively (1  T  100, 1  N  5000).
Then, T lines follow, each one containing a non-empty string w and an integer number i (1  i  N),
where w represents the name of a NewPie Team and i represents the identifier of its captain. You may
assume that w does not contain any blank and that its length does not exceed 30 characters. This is
followed by N lines, one per NewPie student. Each one of these lines contains the students identifier j
(1  j  N), his/her uniform size as an integer sj (1  sj  50), an integer number fj indicating how
many friends j has (0  fj < N), and the list containing the identifiers of his/her Teamface friends
(that list does not have repeated elements and does not include the identifier j). Every line in the input
has no leading blanks and its corresponding data is separated by one blank. The input ends with a line
with two 0 values.

## Sample Input

```
The output for each case starts with Case i: on a single line, where i is the case number starting at
1. For each team in the test case (in the same order that they are given in the input), your program
should output the name of the team on a single line. Then it should output a line with two integers t
and n, where n is the number of uniforms needed for a given size t (1  t  50, 1  n), for all distinct
sizes needed in the team. Sizes should be printed in ascending order.
