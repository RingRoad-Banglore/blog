title: Uva 11328  Drawing Straws at the Office
---


## Input

```
Dwight has recently quit his job at the office. Unfor-
tunately, he left many important files password pro-
tected. The rest of the office staff decide to draw
straws to see who gets stuck with the boring task of
cracking Dwights codes.

Pam gets a stack of n straws and cuts n1 of them
short. Right about the time she finishes, Kevin and
Angela get in a heated discussion over an accounting
error. In her fury, Angela knocks over the box of
straws and they scatter all over the straws that Pam
just cut!

Pam starts to sort out the short straws from the
rest when Michael, the office manager, stops by and
tells her that she doesnt have time to do that. So,
instead of drawing straws the conventional way, the office staff try a new method. Toby, who is not a
direct employee of Michaels, grabs the bundle of straws and stands in the centre of the room. Michaels
n employees stand in a circle around Toby.

Toby arbitrarily chooses an employee to go first. This employee draws a single straw from Tobys
hand. If this straw is short, then they are excused from the circle. If this straw is long, then they must
stay in the circle. In either case, the straw is discarded and play proceeds to the next person on the
left. This continues, in a circular fashion, until all n  1 short straws have been drawn and there is
a single employee left. This employee is given the unfortunate task of cracking Dwights codes. We
assume that when a straw is drawn it is chosen uniformly at random from the remaining straws and
this choice is made independent of other choices.

One employee, named Jim, realizes that there are k employees who draw straws before he draws
his first. Jim also knows how many long straws are in the bundle in Tobys hand. While Jim is in the
hands of fate, he wants to know the probability of him being the only one who doesnt draw a short
straw.

## Output

```
The first line of the input indicates the number of test cases to follow. For each test case, three integers
n, m, and k are specified with 0 < n  100, 0  m  100, and 0  k < n.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the probability that Jim ends up as the last employee in the circle given
that there are n employees, m long straws, and k employees draw their first straw before Jim. The
probability should be output as a percentage rounded to three decimal places. The input is chosen so
that a reasonable implementation of a good algorithm will not suffer from precision errors.
