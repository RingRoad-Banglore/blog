## Input

```
In Africa there is a very special species of bee. Every year, the female bees of such species give birth
to one male bee, while the male bees give birth to one male bee and one female bee, and then they die!

Now scientists have accidentally found one magical female bee of such special species to the effect
that she is immortal, but still able to give birth once a year as all the other female bees. The scientists
would like to know how many bees there will be after N years. Please write a program that helps them
find the number of male bees and the total number of all bees after N years.
