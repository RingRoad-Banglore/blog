## Input

```text
X and Y are two integer numbers and X  Y . The values of X and Y fits in 16-bit signed integer.
When the summation of these two numbers is multiplied with Y we get P and when the absolute value
of the subtraction of these two numbers is multiplied with X we get Q. Given the value of P and Q
you must find the value of X and Y .
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N  75000) that denotes how many lines of inputs
are there. Each of the next N lines contains two integers which denotes the values P and Q respectively,
here |P | < 231, |Q| < 231.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input except the first one produce exactly two lines of output. The first line contains
the serial of output and the next one contains possible values of X and Y . If there is more than one
solution print the pair with smaller X value. When the given values of P and Q is impossible for any
integer value of X and Y print the line Impossible. instead.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
160 48
200 100
300 200

```
