10885 Martin the Gardener
“Ubi materia, ibi geometria.”

Johannes Kepler

A famous archeologist has uncovered the palace of an ancient king. The palace had a beautiful
garden, where the king had 13 trees planted in a very special pattern. The legend says that the king’s
gardener, Martin, planted the trees at the vertices of a square grid. Each cell of the grid was a one-by-
one meter square, and the distance between any pair of trees was always an integer number of meters!
What is even more unbelievable is that no 3 trees were ever on a straight line. Your task is to reconstruct
what the garden might have looked like.

## Input
There is no input for this problem.

## Output
Output the Cartesian coordinates of the 13 trees, one pair per line. No 3 trees may lie on the same line,
and the distance between any pair of trees must be an integer. All the coordinates must be non-negative
and at most 1000000000 (one billion).
