## Input

```

Traveling Spiders is a logical puzzle that needs a sequence of
systematic choices among many alternatives. The puzzle assumes
a geometric object whose surface is partitioned into a set of areas
called cells that are usually congruent, or very similar in their
shapes and sizes. A spider may move around freely on the surface
of the object, but, can move forward from a cell to only one of its
neighboring cells in each step. Now, given some pairs of male and
female spiders, initially positioned all in different cells, we want
to find a set of paths that, respectively, leads each male spider to
his partner. The only condition is that every cell of the object
must be visited once and only once by a male spider during their
traversal.

The Traveling Spiders Puzzle (TSP for short) on Rubiks
Cube problem considers a Rubiks cube, each of whose six faces is partitioned into n n square cells
(the above figure exemplifies the case of n = 4). Here, two square cells are regarded as a neighbor to
each other if and only if they share a side. So, there are four neighbors of a cell, each to east, west,
south, and north. Furthermore, we assume that the cube is floating in the air so that all six faces can
be traversed by a spider. Note that this puzzle problem is still in its early stage. On the other hand,
you are now to write a program to solve a simple single-pair-of-spiders case: given a pair of male and
female spiders put in different cells, find a path that passes every cell of the cube exactly once from the
male spider to the female spider.

## Output

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input specifies T test cases. Hence, the value T
naturally comes in the first line of the input, followed by a set of three lines, describing each test case.
The first line of a test case specifies an even number n, representing the resolution of the cell grid,
where we assume that 2  n  50. The second and third lines indicate the positions of the male and
the female spiders, respectively. The locational data of a spider is encoded as coordinates in 3D space
under the following rule: a corner or vertex of the cube is regarded as the origin and the directions of
the three edges of the cube incident to the origin define those of the positive x, y, and z-axes, forming
a right-handed 3D coordinate system. The side of each cell is of length two, implying that the cube
exists in the space [0, 2n]  [0, 2n]  [0, 2n]. Then, the cell that a spider visits is specified as the x, y
and z-coordinates of its center location.

## Sample Input

```
Your program is to write to standard output. For each test case, the first line of the results must
contain an integer indicating whether there exists a feasible solution. If yes, the integer must be 1;
otherwise -1. If the first line is 1, then it must be followed by 6n2 lines, describing the sequence of
cells that the male spider visits on his way to his partner, including the first and last ones. In case
multiple solutions are possible, just output any one of them.

The following shows sample input and output for two test cases.
