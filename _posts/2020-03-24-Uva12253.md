title: Uva 12253  Simple Encryption
---


```
Some day in the future a person named Reuben wants to submit some interesting problems to the judg-
ing director of ACM ICPC (Association for Copotron Mechanics International Collegiate Programming
Contest) World Finals so that they can be used in World Finals 2031. This contest requires problem
submitters to submit their problems in encrypted format. But in year 2030, encryption software is not
widely available on the Internet just to prevent terrorists from sending encrypted messages. So he wants
to use a simplified encryption technique to submit his problem. He uses several 12-digit encryption
keys to encrypt his messages. We would not disclose the encryption/decryption technique for safety
because your next generations will be competing in World Finals by then. But Reuben also does not
want to send his encryption key in a straightforward email. He wants to send a key (public) K1 that
will implicitly denote the actual key (private) K2. K2 is such a 12 digit number K so that KK21  K2
(modulo 1012).

Given the value of K1 your job is to help Reuben find the value of K2.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains around 1600 line of input. Each line contains an integer, which denotes the
value of K1 (0 < K1 < 50001). A line containing a single zero terminates input.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output, followed by
the given public key K1 and then a possible actual private key K2. Look at the output for sample input
for exact formatting. Inputs will be such that for given value of K1 there will always be at least one
value of K2. Note that K2 should always have 12 digits and will not have any leading zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
78
99
0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: Public Key = 78 Private Key = 308646916096
Case 2: Public Key = 99 Private Key = 817245479899
```
