title: Uva 13138  Kites
---


## Input

```text
The autumn is coming! This season is perfect to play with kites.

To draw a kite is required form a base with two lines of equal
size that are intersecting between them in half, one must be ver-
tical and the other must be horizontal.

Notice that you can take the complete line or a part of the
line. See the example explanation to understand it better.

Given a set of horizontal and vertical lines in the 2D plane
you have to find the diagonals length of the largest kite that is
possible to draw also you have to count how many maximum kites
is possible to draw in the given plane.
```

## Output

```text
There are multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two single-space-separated
integers N , the number of vertical lines and M , the number of horizontal lines (1  N,M  105).

Each of the N lines following describes a vertical line. Each such line is described by three single-
spaceseparated integers Xi, Yi, Li representing the vertical line from (Xi, Yi) to (Xi, Yi + Li).

Similarly, after the N lines describing vertical lines follow M similar lines describing the horizontal
lines. Each such line is described by three single-space-separated integers Xi, Yi, Li representing the
horizontal line from (Xi, Yi) to (Xi + Li, Yi).

All Xi and Yi are between 109 and 109, inclusive. All Li are between 1 and 109, inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print one line containing two integers D and C, where D is the diagonals length of
the largest kite found, and C is how many maximum kites is possible to draw in the given plane, if it
is not possible to draw any kite with D > 0 then the answer should be D = 0 and C = 0.
