```text
The factorial of a positive integer number N , denoted as N !, is defined as the product of all positive
integer numbers smaller or equal to N . For example 4! = 4 3 2 1 = 24.

Given a positive integer number N , you have to write a program to determine the smallest number
k so that N = a1! + a2! + . . .+ ak!, where every ai, for 1  i  k, is a positive integer number.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. A test case is composed of a single line, containing one integer
number N (1  N  105).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the output your program must output the smallest quantity of factorial numbers
whose sum is equal to N .

```

## Sample Output

```text
