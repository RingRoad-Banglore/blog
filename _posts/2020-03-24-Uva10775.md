## Input

```
It was rumored that the first person who solves the Mystical Matrix will get a free Mystical Chicken
dinner from the Mystical Restaurant. Of course, Jack is eager to get that Mystical Chicken dinner.

The Mystical Matrix is a matrix with 3 rows and N columns, with 1, 2, . . . , 3N each occupying one
cell. Furthermore, all rows have the same sum and all columns have the same sum. Help Jack construct
such a Mystical Matrix.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several lines. Each line contains a single positive integer N . You may assume N is
a multiple of 3 and it is less than 1000. The input is terminated by a single integer 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output a valid Mystical Matrix. If non-exists, output IMPOSSIBLE (without quotes). A valid Mystical
Matrix should take 3 lines, with each line consisting of N integers separated by spaces. For example, a
3 9 matrix should look like:

A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9
B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9
C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9

```

## Sample Output

```
3
0
