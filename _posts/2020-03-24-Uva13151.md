## Input

```text
Grading exam scripts of a programming course is often a pain and to reduce the pain teachers often
give full marks only when the examinees output matches exactly with the correct one. Then the mark
can be easily calculated as a percentage of matching. But in some scenario, this approach may not be
right  especially in those cases where the output of each step depends on that of the previous one.
For example in the figure below you can see a program and its correct output. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th
output depends on the output of the previous lines. So if the output of the first line is wrong and the
next three lines are correct the examinee should not get 3 marks because he has made mistakes in all
four cases (Or made a mistake while copying from his friend).

So to grade such a program we adopt the following new policy  we should judge the correctness
of each line based on the output of the immediate previous line. For example, if for the program above
if someones output is:
1000
1000
1001
999
He/she should get 3 marks. Because, the output of the first line is incorrect but based on that lines
output, the output of next three lines are correct.

Given a programs description and its output, you job is to calculate the mark that the examinee
will get.

## Output

```text
There are at most 1001 test cases. The description of each test case is given below:

Each test case starts with two integers ivalue (0 < ivalue10  100000010) and t (0 < t  30). Here
ivalue denotes the initial value of the variable i. This value can be in decimal (leftmost digit is not
zero), octal (leftmost digit is zero) or hexadecimal (starts with 0x and non-numeric digits will be in
uppercase). t denotes the total number of printing statements in the program. Each of the next t lines
contains an expression that the printing function will print followed by the output for the expression
written by the examinee. The expressions can be anyone from the following instruction set, s = {i++,
++i, i--, --i, i}, the output value will be between 0 and 1000000 (inclusive) and of course in
decimal.

Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case produce one line of output. This line contains the mark that the student will get
according to the new policy.
