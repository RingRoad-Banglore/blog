## Input

```
You may have solved linear equation early in the school. Problems involving solving sets of linear
equation are very important in the field of Engineering and Mathematics.

Let us consider that we have a system of linear equations

a11 x1 + a12 x2 + a13 x3 = c1
a21 x1 + a22 x2 + a23 x3 = c2
a31 x1 + a32 x2 + a33 x3 = c3

We can solve it by reducing technique:
Step 1:

a11 x1 +
a12
a11

x2 +
a13
a11

x3 =
c1
a11

a21 x1 + a22 x2 + a23 x3 = c2
a31 x1 + a32 x2 + a33 x3 = c3

Step 2:

a11 x1 +
a12
a11

x2 +
a13
a11

x3 =
c1
a11

a22  a21 a12a11 x2 + a23  a21
a13
a11

x3 = c2  a21 c1a11
a32  a31 a12a11 x2 + a33  a31

a13
a11

x3 = c3  a31 c1a11
Now do as step 1 for second row and so on.
This can be made more effective using matrix method. The set of equation for n unknowns can be

written as

a11 x1 + a12 x2 + a13 x3 + . . . + a1n xn = c1
a21 x1 + a22 x2 + a23 x3 + . . . + a2n xn = c2
a31 x1 + a32 x2 + a33 x3 + . . . + a3n xn = c3

...

an1 x1 + an2 x2 + an3 x3 + . . . + ann xn = cn

In matrix form 


a11 a12 a13 . . . a1n
a21 a22 a23 . . . a2n
a31 a32 a33 . . . a3n

Compactly [A]  {X} = {C}
From this we can solve values of Xs. The matrix [AC] is called an augmented (see example below)

matrix. If after elimination process the rank of matrix [A] and rank of matrix [AC] not equals, the
system is called inconsistent and it does not have a solution. If the matrix is consistent and number
of unknowns is greater then rank of matrix then the matrix system has arbitarily many solutions
containing (NumberOfUnknowns-rank) arbitary constants. Rank of a matrix is defined as the number
of non zero rows of a matrix system. Otherwise if the rank and number of unknows equals then the
system has been solved.

For example let a system of equations be

9x1 + 4x2 + x3 = 17
x1  2x2  6x3 = 14
x1 + 6x2 = 4

This sets of equation can be written as

9 4 1 17
1 2 6 14
1 6 0 4

So the steps involving the solution is Step : 1

1 2 6 14
1 6 0 4
9 4 1 17

Step : 2

1 2 6 14
0 8 6 10
0 22 55 143

Step : 3

1 2 6 14
0 1 3/4 5/4
0 0 77/2 231/2

Step : 4

1 2 6 14
0 1 3/4 5/4
0 0 1 3

Step : 5

1 2 0 4
0 1 0 1
0 0 1 3

Step : 6

1 0 0 2
0 1 0 1
0 0 1 3

and then, the solution is
x1 = 2, x2 = 1, x3 = 3

Again consider this system

2x1 + 2x2 + 2x3 = 2
4x1 + 4x2 + 4x3 = 4
16x1 + 16x2 + 16x3 = 16

Steps are: Step : 1

4 4 4 4
16 16 16 16

Step : 2

1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

This system has number of unknowns 3 and rank is 1. So this system has arbitarily many solutions
containing (3-1) = 2 arbitary constants.

Another system

x+ y = 10, x+ y = 20, 2x+ 2y = 50

Steps are: Step : 1

1 1 10
1 1 20
2 2 50

Step : 2

1 1 10
0 0 10
0 0 30

Step : 3

1 1 10
0 0 10
0 0 30

Step : 4

1 1 10
0 0 10
0 0 1

Step : 5

1 1 0
0 0 0
0 0 1

Step : 6

1 1 0
0 0 0
0 0 1

As rank of [A] (in this case: rank(A) = 1) is not equal to the rank of augmented matrix [AC] (in
this case: rank(AC) = 2) , the system has no solution.

However though there are other methods to compute this solution for the matrix system, the main
problem occurs are

1. Round off errors or computational error due to the use of floating point number

2. Error due to wrong order of the given equation.
To prevent round off error due to floating point number an approach can be used, similar to the

process of doing fractional number. So we may use 1/3 as a expression of two integer, the numerator
and the denominator, instead of .333333 (with loss of precision). Thus we can prevent this kind of
error.

Consider this set of equations

5x3 = 10
3x2  3x3 = 3

2x1  x2 + 2x3 = 7

This set of equations can be written as

0 0 5 10
0 3 3 3
2 1 2 7

Now how will you evaluate this matrix without ordering?
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is the number of the problem. The next line contains two integers - NumberO-
fUnknowns and NumberOfEquations (none of these is less then or equal to 0 and greater then 50). The
next lines contains the matrix for the system of linear equations. There are number of rows equal to
the NumberOfEquations and number of column equal to the NumberOfUnknowns+1. The numbers
may be fractional, that is there may be numbers like 1/3 or 6/8. An problem number zero indicates
the end of input.

```

## Sample Input

```
First print (without the quotation mark)

"Solution for Matrix System # N"

Here N is the problem number as taken from input. Then on the next line, for each system of
equations output the solution (if exists) expressed in the fractional form in each line. You may assume
each of the numerator and denominator part will not exceed the limit of data type long long (64 bit).
If there are many solutions as described above print (without the quotation mark)

"Infinitely many solutions containing n arbitrary constants."

(here n is the number as described above) , and if there is no solutions print (without the quotation
mark)

"No Solution."

Print a blank line between two systems of linear equations.
