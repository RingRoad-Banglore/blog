title: Uva 11747  Heavy Cycle Edges
---


## Input

```text
Given an undirected graph with edge
weights, a minimum spanning tree is a
subset of edges of minimum total weight
such that any two nodes are connected
by some path containing only these edges.
A popular algorithm for finding the mini-
mum spanning tree T in a graph proceeds
as follows:

 let T be initially empty

 consider the edges e1, . . . , em in in-
creasing order of weight

 add ei to T if the endpoints of
ei are not connected by a path
in T

An alternative algorithm is the follow-
ing:

 let T be initially the set of all edges

 while there is some cycle C in T

 remove edge e from T where e has the heaviest weight in C

Your task is to implement a function related to this algorithm. Given an undirected graph G with
edge weights, your task is to output all edges that are the heaviest edge in some cycle of G.
```

## Output

```text
The first input of each case begins with integers n and m with 1  n  1, 000 and 0  m  25, 000
where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges in the graph. Following this are m
lines containing three integers u, v, and w describing a weight w edge connecting nodes u and v where
0  u, v < n and 0  w < 231. Input is terminated with a line containing n = m = 0; this case should
not be processed. You may assume no two edges have the same weight and no two nodes are directly
connected by more than one edge.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output for an input case consists of a single line containing the weights of all edges that are the heaviest
edge in some cycle of the input graph. These weights should appear in increasing order and consecutive
weights should be separated by a space. If there are no cycles in the graph then output the text forest
instead of numbers.
