title: Uva 11726  Crime Scene
---


```
You have been appointed as a programmer in your local police station (they watch a lot of TV shows
like CSI, Numb3rs etc., and though having a computer genius among them would be pretty cool). They
have given you a desktop, Now, you can do all the impossible tasks, that are being done in the shows
frequently (like magnifying an image infinite times with no pixelation, or building systems, where the
only way to reboot is to shut down the main power of the building).

But due to the recent increase in crime and also the economic problems, the station is planning to
make some budget cuts. One of the cut is in the use of crime scene tapes. So, at each crime scene, they
want to use the minimal possible amount of tape.

Two circles and a polygon in the crime scene.
The optimal taping is shown in dark.

You are given all the objects in the crime scene.
The objects are all circular or in the shape of a poly-
gon. Return the minimum amount of crime scene
tapes to surround them.
```

## Input

```
First line contains T , the number of test cases. Each
test case starts with N , the number of objects in the
crime scene. Each of the next N lines describe an
object in the crime scene. The first character in the
line will be either c or p, denoting whether the
object is a circle, or a polygon. If it is a circle, then, it
will be followed by 3 real numbers, (cx, cy) the center
of the circle and radius of the circle.

In case of polygon, it will be followed by an integer
K, the number of sides the polygon will have, followed
by K pairs of real numbers, (xi, yi) the location of the i-th vertex of the polygon.

All polygons in this problem will be simple.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the case number and the optimal length of the tape. Output 6 digits after
the decimal point.
Constraints:

 N  100

 K  10

 All radii will be greater than 0.

 All input values will be between -1000 and +1000.
