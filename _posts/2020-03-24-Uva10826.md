title: Uva 10826  Hot or Cold
---


## Input

```
You are playing a number-guessing game with a friend. He is thinking of an integer between 1 and N
inclusive. You have unlimited guesses to figure it out, but of course you want to do it in as few guesses
as possible. He wont actually tell you if you guess correctly; the only information he will give you
is that, on every guess except the first, he will say warmer or colder depending on whether this
guess is nearer or farther than the previous guess. (If the distance is exactly the same, either may be
said) When you are certain that your last guess was correct, you tell your friend, winning the game.

Note that your guesses must all be genuine guesses, consistent with all the information you
have. You cant guess a number that has no chance of being correct, even though you might want to!

At worst, how many guesses will it take you?
```

## Output

```
Every case consists of a line containing N , 1  N  300. Input will end on a case where N = 0. This
case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output a line containing the maximum number of guesses it should take to guess the
number.

```
