title: Uva 11524  In-Circle
---


## Input

```text

In-circle of a triangle is the circle that touches all the three sides of the triangle internally. The center
of the in-circle of a triangle happens to be the common intersection point of the three bisectors of the
internal angles. In this problem you will not be asked to find the in-circle of a triangle, but will be
asked to do the opposite!!

You can see in the figure above that the in-circle of triangle ABC touches the sides AB, BC and
CA at point P, Q and R respectively and P, Q and R divides AB, BC and CA in ratio m1:n1, m2:n2
and m3:n3 respectively. Given these ratios and the value of the radius of in-circle, you have to find the
area of triangle ABC.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 50001), which denotes how many input sets
are to follow. The description of each set is given below.

Each set consists of four lines. The first line contains a floating-point number r (1 < r < 5000),
which denotes the radius of the in-circle. Each of the next three lines contains two floating-point
numbers, which denote the values of m1, n1, m2, n2, m3 and n3 (1 < m1, n1,m2, n2,m3, n3 < 50000)
respectively.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains a floating-point number that
denotes the area of the triangle ABC. This floating-point number should contain four digits after the
decimal point. Errors less than 5103 will be ignored. Use double-precision floating-point number for
calculation.
