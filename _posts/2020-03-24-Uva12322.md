```
Crystal billboards present snipers with the opportunity of shooting sports in the abandoned neigh-
borhoods of Crystal City. One popular shooting sport for a sniper is to destroy all crystal billboards
in front of a building. The rules of this game enforce the sniper to fix his/her gun to the ground of
the buildings roof, so it can rotate freely in any direction. However, once the gun is fixed, it cannot
be placed in any other location. The goal of the game is to destroy all crystal billboards firing the
minimum number of shots.

Every time the sniper fires, any crystal billboard in the way of the bullet is destroyed, even if the
bullet only touches one extreme of the billboard. A bullet never changes direction or speed once it is
fired, even if it destroys any crystal billboards.

The following figure depicts a sniper in a fixed location facing a layout of ten crystal billboards. The
sniper has destroyed all ten crystal billboards and has achieved the goal of the game because he/she
destroyed all crystal billboards firing the minimum number of shots possible.

Given the initial location of a sniper and a layout of crystal billboards, your task is to determine
the minimum number of shots that would destroy all crystal billboards.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains a natural number B defining the number of crystal billboards in the
shooting layout (1  B  103). Each one of the following B lines contains four integer numbers x1,
y1, x2, y2 separated by blanks, defining the coordinates of the line segment with extremes (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2) (103  x1  103, 0 < y1  103, 103  x2  103, 0 < y2  103, y1  x2 = x1  y2). You can
assume that the shooting layout is modeled as the region on the Cartesian plane above the x-axis, that
the sniper is located in the origin (0, 0), that each crystal billboard is represented with a line segment
whose extremes are not collinear with the origin, and that no pair of crystal billboards intersects. The
last test case is followed by a line containing a zero.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, a line must be printed with the minimum number of shots that fired from the sniper
location would destroy all crystal billboards in the shooting layout.
