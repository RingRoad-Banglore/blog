title: Uva 01535  Lost Lists
---


## Input

```

Younghee an elementary school student just finished her homework. Today her teacher gave her several
lists each containing distinct positive integers. The homework was to calculate every sum of each pair
of integers in a list. The teacher gave students mutually different lists for preventing copying out. So,
she had to do the homework all by herself. It was hard job because she is not so good at arithmetic and
pretty many lists were given. After finishing her homework Younghee went out to play with her friends.
When Younghee returned to home she found out the lists were lost. Only the papers she wrote the
sums were there. Younghee should return the lists at the next class because her teacher would check
up her homework with the lists. Finally Younghee found out who did it. Her mother thought the lists
as garbage and threw them into the garbage can and emptied it. Soon after listening to her mother,
Younghee ran to the garbage box in the outside. Alas! The garbage colle ctor already emptied the box.
After a little consideration Younghee thinks there might be a way to restore the lists. She calls you
and asks you to help her.

In this problem, you are to solve Younghees trouble. For each list of sums Younghee wrote, your
program should restore the list of distinct integers. But, Younghee is not so good at arithmetic. So,
there can be a list of sums which is not restorable, that is, there does not exist a list of integers which
leads to the sums. In that case your program s hould print -1.
```

## Output

```
The input contains T test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer (T ) representing the
number of test cases which is exactly the number of lists Younghee received from her teacher. Each
test case begins with a line containing an integer n, 2 < n < 50, indicating the number of integers in a
list. In the next line, there are n(n 1)/2 positive integers which are the sums of all possible pairs in
non-decreasing order. Each number in the sums will be less than 10000.

```

## Sample Input

```
Print exactly one line for each test case. The output should consist of n distinct positive integers in
increasing order, if restorable. If not restorable, -1 should be printed. Numbers should be separated
by a single space.
