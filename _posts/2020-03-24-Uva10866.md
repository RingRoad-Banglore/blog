title: Uva 10866  Magic Bitstrings
---


## Input

```text
A bitstring, whose length is one less than a prime,
might be magic. 1001 is one such string. In order to
see the magic in the string let us append a non-bit
x to it, regard the new thingy as a cyclic string, and
make this square matrix of bits

each bit 1001
every 2nd bit 0110
every 3rd bit 0110
every 4th bit 1001

This matrix has the same number of rows as the
length of the original bitstring. The m-th row of the
matrix has every m-th bit of the original string start-
ing with the m-th bit. Because the enlarged thingy
has prime length, the appended x never gets used.

If each row of the matrix is either the original
bitstring or its complement, the original bitstring is
magic.
```

## Output

```text
Each line of input (except last) contains a prime num-
ber p  100000. The last line contains 0 and this
line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each prime number from the input produce one
line of output containing the lexicographically small-
est, non-constant magic bitstring of length p1, if such a string exists, otherwise output Impossible.

```

## Sample Output
