## Input

```
The ancient folklore behind the Towers of Hanoi puzzle invented by E. Lucas in 1883 is quite well
known to us. One more recent legend tells us that the Brahmin monks from Benares never believed
that the world could vanish at the moment they finished to transfer the 64 discs from the needle on
which they were to one of the other needles, and they decided to finish the task as soon as possible.

Fig: The Four Needle (Peg) Tower of Hanoi

One of the priests at the Benares temple (who loved the mathematics) assured their colleagues to
achieve the transfer in the afternoon (the rhythm they had thought was a disc-per-second) by using an
additional needle. They couldnt believe him, but he proposed them the following strategy:

 First move the topmost discs (say the top k discs) to one of the spare needles.

 Then use the standard three needles strategy to move the remaining n  k discs (for a general
case with n discs) to their destination.

 Finally, move the top k discs into their final destination using the four needles.

He calculated the value to k in order to minimize the number of movements and get a total of 18433
transfers, so they spent just 5 hours, 7 minutes and 13 seconds against the more than 500000 millions
years without the additional needle (as they would have to do 264  1 disc transfers. Can you believe
it?)

Try to follow the clever priests strategy and calculate the number of transfer using four needles but
according with the fixed and immutable laws of Brahma, which require that the priest on duty must
not move more than one disc at a time and that he must place this disc on a needle so that there is
no smaller disc below it. Of course, the main goal is to calculate the k that minimize the number of
transfers (even thought it is not know for sure that this is always the optimal number of movements).
