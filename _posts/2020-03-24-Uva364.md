## Input

```text
Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may
be included in this Union, according to their respective Numbers... The Number of Repre-
sentatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least
one representative.

Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution

When the writers of the U.S. Constitution wrote those words in Philadelphia in 1787, they could
not have foreseen the trouble they would cause mathematicians. There are numerous different inter-
pretations of how to apportion according to respective Number. For more than 100 years there was
debate as to how to do this apportionment, because different apportionment methods tend to favor
different states. Fortunately, we have computers and can easily compare some of the more popular ap-
portionment methods. Your program should compute the number of representatives each state will get
from the methods and tell which if any of the apportionments will give the state more representatives.

Suppose there were five states in the union: Anxiety, Boredom, Confusion, Dismay, and Ecstasy,
with the following populations (given in thousands):

Anxiety 42
Boredom 178
Confusion 221
Dismay 117
Ecstasy 72

The total population of this country then is 630 thousand. For a house of 30 representatives,
each representative should represent 21 thousand people (notice we have relaxed the constitutional
requirement of at most one representative for each 30,000), so the true apportionment of representatives
would be:

Anxiety 2.00
Boredom 8.48
Confusion 10.52
Dismay 5.57
Ecstasy 3.43

Unfortunately, it is impossible to send half of a representative to Congress, so there needs to be
away of dividing the 30 seats, giving just a positive integral number of representatives to each state.
(All states must have at least one representative.)

There are four major apportionment methods: the Hamilton Method, the Jefferson Method, the
Adams method, and the Webster method. The Hamilton method starts with the true apportionment
and gives each state the whole number corresponding to the true value, so Anxiety will get 2 represen-
tatives, Boredom will get 8, etc. States with less than one representative will get one representative.
Then, if there are any representatives left over, they will go to the states in the order of the fractional
part (states with true apportionment less than one are not considered), where the state with the largest
fractional part (in this case, Dismay with a fractional part of 0.57) will get the first of the extra rep-
resentatives, and the second of the extra representatives will go to the state with the second largest
fraction (Confusion, with a fractional part of 0.52), etc.

The other three methods will not necessarily use the divisor given by dividing the total population by
the number of seats. Instead, they use different divisors to give the desired number of representatives,
making sure each state has at least one representative. The Jefferson Method will find a divisor so
the sum of the truncated quotients gives the desired number of representatives. 19,750 is a possible
divisor for the example using the Jefferson method. Dividing by 19,750 gives the following quotients
and truncating the quotients gives the number of representatives.

State Quotient (/19,750) Representatives
Anxiety 2.13 2
Boredom 9.01 9
Confusion 11.19 11
Dismay 5.92 5
Ecstasy 3.65 3

The Adams Method also looks for a divisor to come up with the desired number of representatives,
but will round up instead of truncate. One possible divisor for the Adams Method with this example
would be 23,000. Dividing by 23,000 gives the following quotients and rounding up gives the number
of representatives.

State Quotient (/23,000) Representatives
Anxiety 1.83 2
Boredom 7.74 8
Confusion 9.61 10
Dismay 5.09 6
Ecstasy 3.13 4

Finally, the Webster Method finds a divisor so when the quotient is rounded (using standard round-
ing rules, where fractional parts of 0.5 or greater round up and fractional parts of less than 0.5 round
down), the sum of the quotients is the desired number of representatives. In this case, a divisor of
21,000 could be used for the Webster method, giving the same number of representatives as the Hamil-
ton method, but this is not always the case.

## Output

```text
The input for this program will be zero or more data sets. The first line of each data set will be the
number of states in the set. There will be at most 50 states in the data. There will then be one line
for each state, giving the state name (a string of exactly 5 characters starting in column1), at least
one blank, and the population (a positive integer). After the information about the states will be
one or more integers, one per line, representing the number of representatives. You may assume this
will always be greater than or equal to the number of states, so each state is guaranteed to have at
least one representative. The end of the number of representatives is indicated by 0 as a number of
representatives.

The end of input is indicated by a data set with 0 states. This input set should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Before each set of data, give the number of the data set. For each number of representatives, echo the
number of representatives and for each state, tell if there is an apportionment method that gives the
state more representatives than the other methods. You may assume the algorithms will work for the
input data as described above. Use the format of the Sample Output below.

Leave a blank line after each number of representatives.
