title: Uva 10718  Bit Mask
---


## Input

```
In bit-wise expression, mask is a common term. You can get a certain bit-pattern using mask. For
example, if you want to make first 4 bits of a 32-bit number zero, you can use 0xFFFFFFF0 as mask and
perform a bit-wise AND operation. Here you have to find such a bit-mask.

Consider you are given a 32-bit unsigned integer N . You have to find a mask M such that L 
M  U and N OR M is maximum. For example, if N is 100 and L = 50, U = 60 then M will be 59
and N OR M will be 127 which is maximum. If several value of M satisfies the same criteria then you
have to print the minimum value of M .
```

## Output

```
Each input starts with 3 unsigned integers N , L, U where L  U . Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input, print in a line the minimum value of M , which makes N OR M maximum.

Look, a brute force solution may not end within the time limit.

```

## Sample Output

```
100 50 60
100 50 50
100 0 100
1 0 100
15 1 15

```
