```

Wily Hacker finds on his chiefs desk the encryption scheme of the chiefs most important messages
(see figure). He also finds, in his chiefs computer, files with cryptograms and the associated encryption
keys. He wishes to write a program for decrypting these cryptograms.

Wily read a book about modern encryption. He discovered that twenty years ago cryptography
became the subject of many applications in the domain of computer data security. More and more
persons wish to make their messages and files confidential. A cipher is a secret method of transforming
plaintext (message) into ciphertext (cryptogram). This operation, called encryption, is controlled by
a encryption key. There must exist the reverse transformation, called decryption, which transforms
ciphertext into plaintext using a decryption key, which is derived using the encryption key.

Wily observes that the algorithm shown in the figure encrypts the 64-bit message M into the 64-bit
cryptogram C, under the control of the 64-bit key K.

The encryption function use 3 types of operations:

 exclusive-or, marked with the symbol 

 addition module 216, marked with the symbol +

 left circular shift, with a number of positions indicated by the input K, marked with the symbol
<

All these functions operate on 16-bit operands.

The algorithm uses the following notations:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 779  Wily Hackers Problem 2/2

 Mi, i=1,4 represents four 16-bit blocks of plaintext;

 Ci, i=1,4 represents four 16-bit blocks of cryptogram;

 Ki, i=1,4 represents four 16-bit blocks of the encryption key.

After much hard work, Wily finds the correct decryption scheme and the method to obtain the
decryption keys.

Your task is to write a program that obtains plain messages from cryptograms and decryption keys
by discovering a suitable scheme, just like Wily Hacker did.
```

## Input

```
The input text file should contain several groups of cryptograms and keys. Each line consists of a
cryptogram, composed of 16 hexadecimal digits (64 bits) and, after blank characters, the 16 hexadecimal
digits (64 bits) of the encryption key.

```

## Output

```
On the output, your program will write the ASCII characters of messages (plaintext), one message per
line, representing the result of decrypting the messages.
