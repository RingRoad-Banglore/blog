title: Uva 13265  Finding Paths
---


## Input

```
Compute the number of paths in 3D cartesian space from (0, 0, 0) to (n,m, k), where n, m, k are positive
integers, such that each step consist of going from (x, y, z) to one of

{(x+1, y+1, z+1), (x, y+1, z+1), (x+1, y, z+1), (x+1, y+1, z), (x+1, y, z), (x, y+1, z), (x, y, z+1)}

Additionally, in at least one of the steps in each path, we end up going from (x, y, z) to one of
{(x+ 1, y + 1, z + 1), (x, y + 1, z + 1), (x+ 1, y, z + 1), (x+ 1, y + 1, z)}.
```

## Output

```
A number of of inputs ( 200), with n, m, k on each line separated by a single space, such that
0 < n,m, k  1000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input, output the number of paths modulo 1000000007.

```

## Sample Output

```
1 1 1
1 2 3

```
