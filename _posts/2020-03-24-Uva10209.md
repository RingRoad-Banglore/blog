```
In the image below you can see a square ABCD,
where AB = BC = CD = DA = a. Four arcs
are drawn taking the four vertexes A, B, C, D
as centers and a as the radius. The arc that is
drawn taking A as center, starts at neighboring
vertex B and ends at neighboring vertex D. All
other arcs are drawn in a similar fashion. Re-
gions of three different shapes are created in
this fashion. You will have to determine the
total area if these different shaped regions.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains a floating-point number
a (0  a  10000) in each line which indicates
the length of one side of the square. Input is
terminated by end of file.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input, output in a single line
the total area of the three types of region (filled with different patterns in the image above).

These three numbers will of course be floating point numbers with three digits after the decimal
point. First number will denote the area of the striped region, the second number will denote the total
area of the dotted regions and the third number will denote the area of the rest of the regions.

## Sample Input

```
0.1
0.2
0.3

```

## Sample Output

```
0.003 0.005 0.002
0.013 0.020 0.007
0.028 0.046 0.016
