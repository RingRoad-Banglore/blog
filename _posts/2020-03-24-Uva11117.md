title: Uva 11117  Little Quilt
---


## Input

```
Little Quilt is a small language introduced by Ravi Sethi in his book Programming Languages. Here,
a restricted version of Little Quilt is presented.

The language is defined by the following BNF grammar:

<QUILT> ::= A | B | turn(<QUILT>) | sew(<QUILT>,<QUILT>)

A and B represent the two primitive quilts. Each primitive quilt corresponds to a matricial arrangement
of 2 2 characters. turn() and sew() are operations over quilts.

The instruction turn(x) turns the quilt x 90 degrees clockwise. The following table illustrates the
primitive quilts as well as examples of the effect of the turn() operation:

A //
/+

turn(A) \\
+\

turn(turn(A)) +/
//

turn(turn(turn(A))) \+
\\

B --
--

turn(B) ||
||

Accordingly, the instruction sew(x,y) sews quilt x to the left of quilt y. Both x and y must have
the same height, otherwise an error will be generated. The following figure represents the result of
sew(A,turn(B)):

//||
/+||

while the sew(turn(sew(B,turn(B))),A) generates an error message.
Your job is to build an interpreter of the Little Quilt language.
```

## Output

```
The input file will be a text file containing different Little Quilt expressions, each one ended by a
semicolon character (;). Space and new line characters must be ignored; this means that an expression
may span several lines.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output file contains the quilts produced as a result of interpreting the input expressions.

Each quilt must be preceded by a line, left aligned, with the format
Quilt i:
where i is the quilt number, starting at 1. If the expression interpretation generates and error, the word
error
must be printed.
