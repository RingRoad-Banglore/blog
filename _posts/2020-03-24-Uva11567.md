```
Lets play a number game. We start with N = 0, and we want to make N = a given integer S.

Only three types of operations are allowed:

1. INC : increment N by 1, i.e. N  N + 1

2. DEC : decrement N by 1, i.e. N  N  1

3. DBL : double N , i.e. N  2N

Of course we want to make N = S with the minimum number of operations. Consider an example:
Let S = 7. Then only 5 steps are required, for instance:

1. INC : N = 0 + 1 = 1

2. INC : N = 1 + 1 = 2

3. DBL : N = 2 2 = 4

4. DBL : N = 2 4 = 8

5. DEC : N = 8 1 = 7 DONE!!
```

## Input

```
Input contains no more than 200 lines. Each line contains one integer S (0  S  231). Input is
terminated by EOF.

```

## Output

```
For each S, output the minimum number of operations required to make N = S. You may assume that
N is of infinite precision, so NO overflow will ever occur.

```

## Sample Input

```
7

```

## Sample Output

```
5
