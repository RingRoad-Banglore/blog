title: Uva 11522  Pyramid Number
---


## Input

```text

A group of archaeologists have come across a new kind of number
pattern while analyzing the hieroglyphs patterns in The not so
great pyramid. They have decided to call these numbers Pyra-
mid numbers.

A number n is called a Pyramid number if we can partition n
into k positive integers xi (1  i  k) such that

k
i=1

1

xi
= 1. For example, 1 =

1

2
+

1

2

So, 4 (2 + 2) is a Pyramid number.

A number n is called a Strictly Pyramid number if we can
partition n into k distinct positive integers xi (1  i  k) such that

k
i=1

1

xi
= 1. For example, 1 =

1

2
+

1

3
+

1

6

Here, 11 (2 + 3 + 6) is Strictly Pyramid whereas in the above example, 4 is Pyramid but not
Strictly Pyramid.

Given two positive integers a & b, find the number of Strictly Pyramid numbers between a & b
(inclusive).
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file will contain an integer T (T  100), the number of test cases. Each of
the following T lines will be consisting of 2 integers a & b (1  a, b  1000000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print an integer which is the number of Strictly Pyramid numbers between a & b
(inclusive).

```

## Sample Output

```text
5

1 10

1 11

1 100

70 80

110 120

```
