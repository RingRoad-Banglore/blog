title: Uva 01043  Crossing Streets

## Input

```text
Peter Longfoot is a student at the university of Suburbia. Every morning, Peter leaves home to walk to
the university. Many other students are driving their cars or riding their bicycles to campus, but Peter
prefers to walk, avoiding the chaotic traffic of the city as much as possible.

Unfortunately, Peter cannot avoid the traffic entirely, since he has to cross streets in order to reach
the university. Recently, Peter has wondered how to minimize the number of streets he has to cross.
For example, in the following map, streets are drawn as horizontal and vertical lines. To reach the
university starting at his home, Peter has to cross at least two streets. Peter cannot cross a street pair
at an intersection and Peter cannot walk along a street.

Figure: Streets are shown as straight lines and the arrows show possible walking paths for Peter. The
black arrows show one possible path for Peter where he only has to cross two streets. The gray arrows
show a path for Peter where he needs to cross four streets. The path shown by the dotted arrows is
not legal because it crosses two streets at an intersection. The figure above corresponds to the first

sample input.

Peter knows the locations of all streets in the city, but he has trouble figuring out the best way to
the university. So you must write a program to help him.

## Output

```text
The input consists of several descriptions of cities. Each description starts with a line containing a single
integer n (1  n  500), the number of streets in the city. This is followed by n lines, each containing
four integers x1, y1, x2, y2, indicating that there is a street from coordinates (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). All
streets are parallel to either the x- or y-axis, since the city is built on a square grid. Streets can overlap,
in which case they are counted as only one street. The city description is concluded by a line containing
four integers xh, yh, xu, yu, the coordinates (xh, yh) of Peters home, and the coordinates (xu, yu) of the
university, respectively. Neither Peters home nor the university will be located on a street. You should
consider the streets as straight-line segments, so the streets have no width. Although the endpoints of

the streets are integers, Peter doesnt need to walk along the grids. He can walk in any direction he
likes. The magnitudes of all integers in the input file are less than 2 109.

The input is terminated by a line consisting of the integer zero.
