title: Uva 11080  Place the Guards
---


## Input

```text
In the country of Ajabdesh there are some streets and junctions.
Each street connects 2 junctions. The king of Ajabdesh wants to
place some guards in some junctions so that all the junctions and
streets can be guarded by them. A guard in a junction can guard
all the junctions and streets adjacent to it. But the guards them-
selves are not gentle. If a street is guarded by multiple guards
then they start fighting. So the king does not want the scenario
where a street may be guarded by two guards. Given the infor-
mation about the streets and junctions of Ajabdesh, help the king
to find the minimum number of guards needed to guard all the
junctions and streets of his country.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains a single integer T (T < 80) indicating the number of test cases. Each
test case begins with 2 integers v (1  v  200) and e (0  e  10000.). v is the number of junctions
and e is the number of streets. Each of the next e line contains 2 integer f and t denoting that there
is a street between f and t. All the junctions are numbered from 0 to v  1.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output in a single line an integer m denoting the minimum number of guards needed
to guard all the junctions and streets. Set the value of m as -1 if it is impossible to place the guards
without fighting.
