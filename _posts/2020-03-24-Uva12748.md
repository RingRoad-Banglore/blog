title: Uva 12748  WiFi Access
---


```

Wifi Internet connection has become such a part and parcel of our live nowadays that it seems to be one
of the first questions when a tech-aware guy goes to a new place that, there is a wifi network available
here. We are here to asses such a scenario here.

In an area, there are n Wifi routers. Each router is located at a fixed position with their co-ordinates
given on a 2D cartesian plane. A router covers a circular area of radius r centered at its position. If
someone with a Wifi enabled gadget enters in this area (including the center and periphery), they will
be able to connect to that particular router. So, in order to be under Wifi coverage, one needs to be
within the circular coverage area of any Wifi router present in that scenario. You can assume that the
networks are not password protected and if an area is under coverage of multiple routers, theres no
issue related to interference. Now, given your locations in a particular area, you need to determine if
you are under Wifi coverage or not.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a number T (1  T  100), the number of test cases. Each case starts with 2
integers, n (1  n  100), denoting the number of routers in that case and y (1  y  10), the number of
different locations from where you are trying to access the Wifi network (possibly on different moments
in time).

It may be noteworthy that, multiple routers can be present at the same location. Each of the next
n lines contains 3 integers, rx (1000  rx  1000), the x-coordinate of the router, ry (1000  ry 
1000), the y-coordinate of the router and r (1  r  1000), radius of the coverage area for this router.
This is followed by y lines with 2 integers each, yx (1000  yx  1000) and yy (1000  yy  1000),
a pair of x, y coordinate values denoting your location.

```

## Output

```
Each test case begins with a line of the form Case X:, where X is the number of test case. This is
followed by y lines, one for each pair of yx, yy value in that input case. A particular line will contain
Yes if you are under Wifi Coverage for that location and No otherwise.
