title: Uva 10403  Escape from Tuts Tomb
---


## Input

```
Congratulations Indiana: You have successfully
penetrated Tuts inner chamber and bask in un-
told fortune and glory. But alas, your clumsy
sidekick has tripped a booby trap and the only
way to save both of your lives is to solve the
following puzzle quickly.

Before you sit n gold sphinxes of distinct
integer weights 1 . . . n. In order to escape you
must place them in the proper order on the
n stones in front of you. Your awkward but
clever sidekick has deciphered some hieroglyphs
on the wall next to you and discovered that they
contain various weighings of the sphinxes. Use
this information to deduce the proper order.
```

## Output

```
Input file contains several sets of input. The description of each set is given below:

The first line contains two numbers n and m (1  n  26, 1  m  10000) where n is the number of
sphinxes and m is the number of weighings. The next m lines are the weighings. For convenience, the
stones have been labelled alphabetically. Each line contains n letters divided by a <, =, or > where the
separator indicates the sphinxes that go on the lettered stones on the left are less, equal to, or greater
than in weight than the sphinxes on the right respectively.

Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```
If there is no solution print No solution possible! and prepare to die. Otherwise, print Solution:
followed by the weight of the sphinxs that go on the stones ordered alphabetically. If more than one
solution exists, find the solution that minimizes the weight on the first stone, then the second stone,
etc.

```

## Sample Output

```
3 5
a c = b
a c = b
b c > a
a c = b
c < a b
3 5
a c = b
a c = b
