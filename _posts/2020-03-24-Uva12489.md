## Input

```text
Researchers from the Foundation Against Cancer (FCC) announced a revolutionary discovery in Chem-
istry: they discovered how to make carbon atoms bind to any number of other carbon atoms, enabling
the creation of more complex molecules than those formed by tetravalent carbon. According to the
FCC, this will allow the development of new drugs that may be crucial in fighting cancer.

Currently, the FCC can only synthesize molecules that have a single bonds between the carbon
atoms and contain no cycles in their structures: for example, the FCC can synthesize molecules (a),
(b) and (c) below, but not the molecule (d).

Due to thermal agitation, the same molecule can take several formats. Two molecules are equivalent
if it is possible to move the atoms of the molecules, without breaking any of the existing chemical bonds
or creating new chemical bonds, so that both molecules are exactly equal. For example, in the figure
above, molecule (a) is not equivalent to molecule (b), but is equivalent to molecule (c).

You should write a program that, given the structures of two molecules, determines if they are
equivalent.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains an integer N indicating the
number of atoms in the two molecules. The atoms are identified by integers from 1 to N . Each the
following 2N  2 lines describes a chemical bonds between two atoms: the first N  1 lines describe
the chemical bonds of the first molecule, the last N  1 lines describe the chemical bonds of the second
molecule. Each line contains two integers A and B indicating that a chemical bond exists between
atoms A and B.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case your program must print a single line, containing a single character: S if the
molecules are equivalent or N otherwise.

Restrictions

 2  N  104

 1  A,B  N
