title: Uva 12361  File Retrieval
---


```
The operating system of your computer indexes the files on your hard disk based on their contents, and
provides textual search over them. The content of each file is a non-empty string of lowercase letters.
To do a search, you specify a key, which is also a non-empty string of lowercase letters. The result
is a list of all the files that contain the key as a substring. A string s is a substring of a string t if t
contains all characters of s as a contiguous sequence. For instance, foofoo, cafoo, foota and foo
all contain foo as a substring, while foa, fofo, fioo and oofo do not.

You know the content of each file on your hard disk, and wonder whether each subset of the files
is searchable. A subset of the files is searchable if there exists at least one key that produces exactly
the list of those files as a result. Given the contents of the files on your hard disk, you are asked to
compute the number of non-empty searchable subsets.
```

## Input

```
Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains an integer F representing the
number of files on your hard disk (1  F  60). Each of the next F lines indicates the content of one
of the files. The content of a file is a non-empty string of at most 104 characters; each character is one
of the 26 standard lowercase letters (from a to z).

The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output a line with an integer representing the number of non-empty searchable
subsets.
