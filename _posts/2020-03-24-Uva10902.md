title: Uva 10902  Pickup sticks
---


```
Stan has n sticks of various length. He throws them
one at a time on the floor in a random way. After
finishing throwing, Stan tries to find the top sticks,
that is these sticks such that there is no stick on top
of them. Stan has noticed that the last thrown stick
is always on top but he wants to know all the sticks
that are on top. Stan sticks are very, very thin such
that their thickness can be neglected.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of a number of cases. The data for each
case start with 1  n  100000, the number of sticks
for this case. The following n lines contain four num-
bers each, these numbers are the planar coordinates
of the endpoints of one stick. The sticks are listed in
the order in which Stan has thrown them. You may
assume that there are no more than 1000 top sticks.
The input is ended by the case with n = 0. This case
should not be processed.

```

## Output

For each input case, print one line of output listing
the top sticks in the format given in the sample. The
top sticks should be listed in order in which they were
