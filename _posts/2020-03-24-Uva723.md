## Input

```
Given an arbitrary, syntactically correct, Pascal source program, you are to compress it according to
the following guidelines, applied in the order listed:

 Replace all sequences of blanks, except those within a string constant, with a single blank. Recall
that string constants are delimited by single quotes (), a string constant must contain at least
one character, and that two consecutive single quotes () represent the single quote character.

e.g., the following are string constants

'this is a string constant'

'don''t you see the fun here?'

 eliminate all comments  comments start with (* and are terminated with *) or they start with
{ and are terminated with }. Remove the entire comment including the end markers (i.e., (*, *),
{ and }).

e.g., the following are comments:

(* here is a great comment *)

{ and here is a somewhat longer one }

 eliminate any totally blank lines (i.e., any lines, after removing any comments, which consist only
of blanks and end-of-line characters  if when printed, or displayed, a blank line would occur,
it should be eliminated.) You can assume there will be no tabs or other unusual non-printing
characters within the input.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains an arbitrary, syntactically correct, Pascal source program.

```

## Sample Input

```
Compress the input file into the output file using the rules above. The results should result in a
syntactically valid Pascal program; albeit it in a somewhat less stylish form.

```

## Sample Output

```
Program Test (input, output);
{ this is a great program }

Var X, Y : integer ;

begin
readln (X, Y);

writeln (X, ' This is Y ', Y, "Hi!') ;
end.
