The year is 2115. The asteroid communication relay system was set up a decade ago by the Asteroid
Communication Ministry. It is running fine except for one small problem  there are too many
asteroids! The smaller ones not only keep interfering with the signals from the relay stations but they
are also a danger to all the maintenance aircrafts that fly between the stations. These small asteroids
must be destroyed! The Interplanetary Coalition to Prevent Catastrophes (ICPC) has been charged
with removing these dangerous asteroids and has hired an elite team of hot-shot pilots for the job. Han
Duo is the captain of this team of asteroid destroyers. Armed with his missiles, Han flies through the
asteroid belt blowing up any asteroid that the ICPC deems a nuisance.

The ICPC is having some unfortunate budgetary problems. One result of this is that Han and his
team do not have as many missiles as they would like, so they cannot blow up all the troublesome
asteroids. But the asteroids are small and the missiles are powerful. So if two asteroids are near each
other and line up properly, it is possible to take out both with a single missile.

Hans screen displays asteroids as non-rotating two-dimensional simple convex polygons, each of
which moves at a fixed velocity. He has decided that the best time to hit two asteroids is when the
overlap of the two polygons is at a maximum. For example, Figure B.1, which illustrates Sample Input
1, shows two asteroids and snapshots of their subsequent positions at 1-second intervals. The two
asteroids start touching after 3 seconds and the maximum overlap area occurs between 4 and 5 seconds.

Figure B.1: Sample Input 1. Two asteroids with crossing paths.

Calculating when the maximum overlap occurs for two asteroids requires a bit of programming, but
unfortunately Han slept through most of his coding classes at the flight academy. This is where you
come in.

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1710  Asteroids 2/2

The input consists of two asteroid specifications. Each has the form n x1 y1 x2 y2 . . . xn yn vx vy
where n (3  n  10) is the number of vertices, each xi, yi (10000  xi, yi  10000) are the coordinates
of a vertex of the asteroid on Hans screen given in clockwise order, and vx, vy (100  vx, vy  100)
are the x and y velocities (in units/second) of the asteroid. The xi, yi values specify the location of
each asteroid at time t = 0, and the polygons do not intersect or touch at this time. The maximum
length of any side of an asteroid is 500. All numbers in the input are integers.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, display the time in seconds when the two polygons have maximum intersection,
using the earliest such time if there is more than one. If the two polygons never overlap but touch each
other, treat it as an intersection where the common area is zero and display the earliest such time. If
the polygons never overlap or touch, display never instead. You should consider positive times only.
Your output should have an absolute or relative error of at most 103.
