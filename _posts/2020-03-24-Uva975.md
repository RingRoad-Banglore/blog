## Input

```text

Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg was a German gold-
smith and inventor who achieved fame for his invention of the tech-
nology of printing with movable types during 1447.

As his invention became famous orders from printing books
poured in. With too much work to handle he hired Clumseisch zur
Hidemberg to help him. Clumseisch was also a brilliant inventor but
under Gutembergs shadow he never had the chance to showcase his
own inventions (word has spread that we would be 400 years more
advanced if he had done so).

Clumseisch work consisted of carrying trays containing block let-
ters that allowed Gutemberg to print each individual book page. But
he was very clumsy and constantly dropped the tray. And when this
happened, often individual blocks would fall from the tray leaving
empty spaces.

He was lucky though, because when this happened he could use
his most wonderfull invention: a C++ portable compiler crafted
from solid wood. He invented an algorithm that would tell him in
how many different ways he could rearrange the fallen letter blocks
and still form meaningfull words.

Your problem will be to recreate Clumseischs algorithm

## Output

```text
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive
test cases are separated by a single blank line.

The first line of the input will contain the number of lines (1  nl  10) of the tray Clumseisch
was carrying. Then, nl lines will contain the words that were in that same tray. Underscores ( ) will
represent fallen letters. There will never be more than 200 total words.

The next line will contain the number of different letters on the ground (lowercase english alphabet).
Beware that not all letters on the ground were part of the tray being carried (Gutembergs shop was
many times a complete mess). After that, comes a line for each letter containing the actual letter and
the number of times Clumseisch found it lying in the floor.

The last part of the input contains an english dictionary. This dictionary will contain several english
words (in no particular order) in the same line. The first line will contain the number of lines of the
dictionary. The dictionary will not contain more than 1000 words.

In all the input, words will never have more than 40 letters.

```

## Sample Input

```text

into the tray using valid english words.
