title: Uva 10312  Expression Bracketing
---


```
In this problem you will have to find in how many ways n letters can be bracketed so that the bracketing
is non-binary bracketing. For example 4 letters have 11 possible bracketing:

xxxx, (xx)xx, x(xx)x, xx(xx), (xxx)x, x(xxx), ((xx)x)x, (x(xx))x, (xx)(xx), x((xx)x), x(x(xx))

Of these the first six bracketing are not binary. Given the number of letters you will have to find
the total number of non-binary bracketing.
