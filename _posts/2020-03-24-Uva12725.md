title: Uva 12725  Fat and Orial
---


## Input

```text

Fat is a very popular kid, but unfortunately his grades are not directly proportional to his amount
of friends. Orial, one of Fats friends, was determined to help Fat and decided to call you to make a
program. Currently, the total average grade of Fat is N , and he has already attended A disciplines.
Fat wishes to achieve the total average grade of M by the time he has attended B more disciplines.
Help Orial to make a program that helps Fat estimate the average grade he should score on the next
B disciplines so that he achieves the total average grade of M . The grading system is such that its
impossible to score a grade lower than 0 or bigger than 10.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains T (T  105)  the number of test cases, after this line T test cases follows. Each
test case is arranged in a line containing the numbers N , M , A and B (0  N,M  10; 1  A,B  100)
in a single line  Fats current total average grade, desired total average grade, amount of disciplines
he has attended and amount of disciplines he will attend, correspondingly. N and M are real numbers,
and A and B are integers.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print a line containing Case #X: Y , where X is the case number, starting at 1,
and Y is either a floating point number, which is the average grade that Fat should score from now on
to obtain the desired total average grade, or Impossible if its impossible to obtain such an average
grade. In the case where its possible to achieve the goal, Y should be rounded up to 2 digits after the
decimal point. The input will be in a way that errors up to 103 will still give the correct answer.
