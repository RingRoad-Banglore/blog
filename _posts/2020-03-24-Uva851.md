title: Uva 00851  Maze
---


```
You have been blindfolded and deposited someplace in a maze. You have no idea where you are. You
do know, however, that the maze is laid out on a grid, and that each grid location is either blocked or
free. In fact, you have memorized a map of the maze. Also, your magnetic personality allows you to
always sense which direction is north.

In this maze, you have four possible moves: north, south, east, and west. Your task is to find the
shortest sequence of moves that will guarantee your escape, regardless of your initial placement in the
maze. You have escaped whenever you reach a square on an outside edge of the grid (and if you start
there, then youve already escaped). Further moves are irrelevant once you have escaped. If you try to
walk into a wall, you will simply stay in the same spot.

You may assume that it is possible to escape from every unblocked position in the maze.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

Input consists of a positive integer n  8, followed by n lines giving the rows of an n by n grid.
This grid describes the maze you are trapped in. Written on the screen, north is up. Blocked locations
are denoted by the character O (thats an uppercase o), while unblocked locations are indicated by
the character ..

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

Output consists of a number of lines, each consisting of one of north, south, east, or west,
indicating the shortest sequence of moves that guarantees escape for any possible unblocked starting
position.

If there are multiple possible shortest sequences, any of them will do.
