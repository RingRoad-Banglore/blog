title: Uva 00866  Intersecting Line Segments
---


## Input

```text
In a 2-D Cartesian space, a straight line segment A is defined by two points A0 = (x0, y0), A1 = (x1, y1).
The intersection of line segments A and B (if there is one), together with the initial four points, defines
four new line segments.

Figure 1.1 - Intersections of line segments

In Figure 1.1, the intersection P between lines B
and C defines four new segments. As a result, the
toal amount of line segments after the evaluation of
intersections is five.

Given an initial set of lines segments, determine
the number of line segments resulting from the eval-
uation of all the possible intersections.

It is assumed, as a simplification, that no coin-
cidences may occur between coordinates of singular
points (intersections or end points).
```

## Output

```text
The input begins with a single positive integer on a
line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line
is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first line of the input contains the integer number N of line segments. Each of the following N
lines contains four integer values x0 y0 x1 y1, separated by a single space, that define a line segment.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

The integer number of lines segments after all the possible intersections are evaluated.

Note: Figure 1.2 corresponds to the sample below.
