title: Uva 12901  Refraction
---


```
We all know the common test of refraction of light with the visibility of a coin kept at the bottom of a
bowl or cup. From a certain position the coin is not visible, but if we pour water into the bowl or cup
it again becomes visible.

The empty bowl and the coin is not visible The bowl is filled with water and a part of the
coin is visible

In this problem we will discuss A 2D version
of this problem and it is shown in the figure on
the left. We have a bowl made of opaque (not
able to be seen through or not transparent) ma-
terial. The coordinate of the lower left corner
of the bowl is (0, 0). At the bottom we have
a point object at C whose coordinate is (x, 0).
The width of the bowl is W and the height is
H. The refractive index of the transparent liq-
uid (with respect to air) is  (In the figure on
the left

 =
sinMPE
sinCPN

and the location of the eye is E(xe, ye). Now if
the bowl is empty then the object may or may

not be visible (at the shown figure it is not visible) from the location of the eye, but as the bowl is filled
with liquid so due to refraction, the light reflected from the object can reach the eye and it becomes
visible. Now given the width and height of the bowl, abscissa of the object (ordinate is always zero),
coordinate of the eye and refractive index  of the liquid, you will have to find the minimum possible
depth of the liquid (h) for which the object will be visible.

## Input

```
First line of the input file contains an integer T (0 < T < 100001) which denotes the number of test
cases. Each of the next T lines contains the input for one test case.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12901  Refraction 2/2

Each line contains 5 integers W (100  W  1000), H (100  H  1000), x (1  x < W ), xe
(W < xe  2000), ye (H < ye  2000) and a floating-point number  (1.1000    5.0000). The
meaning of these symbols are given in the problem statement.

```

## Output

```
For each test case produce one line of output. This line contains a floating-point number hmin, which
indicates the minimum depth of the liquid for which the object will be visible from the location of the
eye. This number should always have four digits after the decimal point. If the object is not visible
under any circumstances print the line Impossible instead. You can assume that inputs will be such
so that small precision errors (absolute error of 3  106 will not create any difference in the output.
Look at the output for sample input for details.
