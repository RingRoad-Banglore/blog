## Input

```text
Given n, a positive integer,
how many positive integers
less than n are relatively
prime to n? Two integers a
and b are relatively prime if
there are no integers x > 1,
y > 0, z > 0 such that a = xy
and b = xz.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases.
For each test case, standard
input contains a line with
n  1, 000, 000, 000. A line
containing 0 follows the last
case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case there should be single line of output answering the question posed above.

```

## Sample Output
