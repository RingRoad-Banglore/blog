title: Uva 01275  The Revolution of the Ants
---


```

After living in Bill Hill for 100 million years, the ants will face the most serious crisis. One soldier ant,
White Young Hunter, has got the news that human beings will develop this area. He must let all the
communication ants (com-ants) know this message so that the message can be broadcast to the whole
empire, and these ants can start a revolution to survive the distress.

There are on Bill Hill many anthills connected by some paths, which have special smell. Each
com-ant always moves at the same speed on its circular cruise route, which is composed of several smell
paths. When two com-ants meet in a path, they will exchange all of their messages. The time of the
exchange can be ignored. At the beginning, all the com-ants are at the first anthill in their routes, and
White Young Hunter tells the news to the com-ant numbered 1 (The soldier ant has been tired out
after having run from the human world to Bill Hill, and had better have a good rest). Your task is to
write a program to figure out whether all the com-ants can get the message.
```

## Input

```
The input file consists of several test cases. Each case will begin with three integers n, m and a
(0  n < 100, 0  m < 100, 0  a < 100) which indicate the number of the anthills, the number of
the paths, and the number of the com-ants. Following n, m and a, there are m lines which describe
the paths. Each line includes three positive integers x, y and t, which indicate the two end points of
the path and the time for an ant to cruise from one end to the other. Each (x, y) appears no more
than once. Following the path description, there are a lines, which describe the cruise routes. Each line
includes several integers, which indicate the anthill number on the route, and is ended by a single zero.
Any route will not contain more than 100 waypoints. While n, m and a equals zero indicates the end
of the file, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, find out whether all the com-ants can get the message. Display, as shown below,
the test case number and the solution Revolution can start. or Revolution fails. if it is
impossible to let all com-ants know the message. A blank line should be printed after each test case.
