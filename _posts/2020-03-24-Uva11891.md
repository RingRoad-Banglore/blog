## Input

```text
The Army of Computing Men (ACM) is one the
strongest armies in the world. They are well-equipped
and have trained and armed programmers They fight to
spread creativity teamwork and innovation among peo-
ple.

The last victory of the ACM against knowledge mo-
nopolies brought them wealthy spoils. The supply arms
have located position of N crates along a straight line in
the jungle. Some trucks are to carry the crates to the
army base. Since the jungle is so dense, it is costly for a
truck to cut through and bring the crates back. There-
fore commanders have decided to group the crates to-
gether in points and use the minimum number of trucks.
For each such gathering point we should use a truck.
Each truck has a maximum capacity of K crates and
has required fuel to bring only one shipment.

The army men wany to obey their commanders with
minimum effort. Each crate has a weight. The effort
needed to handle a crate along the line can be formulized by the weight of the crate multiplied by the
distance it is carried. It is important not to change the order of crates while there are carried.

You are appointed to manage the shipping procedures. Higher ranked commanders asked you for
a report o minimum needed resources. You should first consider minimizing the number of trucks and
then the army effort. Write your report as soon as possible.
```

## Output

```text
In the first line there will be T (T  50), number of tests. Each test begins with an integer N and K
(1  N  105, 1  K  100). It is followed by N pairs of integers pi and wi (1  pi, wi  106), position
and the weight of i-th crate. Crates appear in the input in increasing order of their position. No two
crates occupy the same position in the beginning.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test print the minimum number of trucks and the minimum effort needed to collect all crates
in a single line separated by a single space.

Hint:
In the first sample test, we need at least 3 trucks to carry the crates. the optimal solution is to carry

crate number (1), (2, 3), (4, 5) in separate trucks with costs 0, 2 (for carrying crate 2 to the position
of crate 3) and 8 (for carrying crate 5 to the position of crate 4) respec vely.
