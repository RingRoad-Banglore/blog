title: Uva 11378  Bey Battle
---


```
Dark Blader has returned with new tactics. They are now able to create an energy field around its blade
and if any blade enters inside any of these energy fields the energy level of the Bit-beast drastically
decreases. So Tyson had to avoid these energy fields and finally he has won!

I was lucky enough to be around Kenny who was analyzing the game with his PC and helping Tyson
to avoid the energy field. I saw that the energy field was Square in shape and the blade was at its
centre. At that instant a problem came to my mind and let me see how efficiently you can solve that
problem.

There will be N points in a 2D plane. Find out the maximum size such that if you draw such size
squares around each point (that point will be at the center of the square) no two squares will intersect
each other (can touch but not intersect). To make the problem simple the sides of the squares will be
parallel to X and Y axis.
```

## Input

```
Input contains several test cases. Each case starts with N which will be at most 10,000 except one
case which will be 100,000. Then there are N lines  pairs of integers denoting the coordinate of each
point. The absolute value of the integers can be at most 1,000,000. X or Y coordinate of any two points
will be unequal.

```

## Output

```
Output a single line for each test case  maximum side length of square.
