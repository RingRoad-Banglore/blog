## Input

```
Nowadays emoticon has become an art. People are no longer limited to simple ones like :-), :-(,
:-P, etc. They use >:O, ~_~, =^_^= and so on. Recently I came across ^_^ and it looks kind of
cute to me. Given a string S consisting of only _s and ^s, I was wondering what is the maximum
number of disjoint subsequences of ^_^ (quote for beauty) in the string S.

For example, if S = ^^__^^ then the answer is 2. However, for S = _^^ the answer is 0.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with a positive integer T ( 5, 000), denoting the number of test cases. Hence follows T
test cases. Each case consists of a single string made of only ^ and _. The length of the strings would
be at most 100,000 and the sum of lengths of the strings will be 2,100,000 at most.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number followed by the answer.
Hint:

 S[1...n] means S is a string of length n and it is 1-indexed.

 Si means ith character of S.

 A string S[1...n] is a subsequence of another string T [1...m], if we can find: (t1, t2, . . . , tn) such
that, S[i] = T [ti] for 1  i  n and 1  t1 < t2 < . . . < tn  m. For example, abc is a
subsequence of aabbcc but not of bca.

 Two subsequences are disjoint if same character (position matters) is not used in both of the
subsequences. For example, let S = abca. ab and ca are two disjoint subsequences of S.
However, if S = abc then ab and ac are not disjoint subsequences. In both of these examples
the subsequences are unique. However, for S = aabb lets form two subsequences S1S3 and S2S4
(both are ab), both of these are disjoint. But if we have chosen S1S3 and S1S4 then they would
not be disjoint.

```

## Sample Output

```
5
_^^_^^_
^__^__^
______
^^__^^
^_^^_^

```
