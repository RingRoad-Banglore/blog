title: Uva 12031  Sum of Four Squares
---


## Input

```
You will be given an integer n, and you will have to express as summation of four square-numbers.

For example 30 can be written as summation of four squares in the following way:

30 = 4  4 + 3  3 + 2  2 + 1  1

If a number can be expressed as summation of four squares in more than one ways, any one of them
will do. A square is a number whose square root is also an integer.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 120000), denoting the number of test cases. Each case contains an
integer n (0  n < 1017) in a line.

Note: As the size of the input file is large, so use faster I/O functions like scanf(), printf().

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print a line containing four integer numbers a, b, c, d such that

n = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2

If the number cannot be expressed as summation of four squares then you should print Impossible.
instead.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
30
2
0

```
