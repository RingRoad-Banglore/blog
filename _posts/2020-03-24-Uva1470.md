title: Uva 01470  Casting Spells
---


## Input

```

Casting spells is the least understood technique of dealing with real life. Actually, people find it quite
hard to distinguish between a real spells like abrahellehhelleh (used in the battles and taught at the
mage universities) and screams like rachelhellabracadabra (used by uneducated witches for shouting
at cats).

Finally, the research conducted at the Unheard University showed how one can measure the power
of a word (be it a real spell or a scream). It appeared that it is connected with the mages ability to
pronounce words backwards. (Actually, some singers were burned at the stake for exactly the same
ability, as it was perceived as demonic possession.) Namely, the power of a word is the length of the
maximum subword of the form wwRwwR (where w is an arbitrary sequence of characters and wR is w
written backwards). If no such subword exists, then the power of the word is 0. For example, the power
of abrahellehhelleh is 12 as it contains hellehhelleh and the power of rachelhellabracadabra is 0.
Note that the power of a word is always a multiple of 4.
