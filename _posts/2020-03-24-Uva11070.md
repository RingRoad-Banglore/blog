## Input

```text
In the stoneage things werent as easy for programmers as they are today. For example programmers had
only very slow computers with a very limited main memory and very small hard disks at their disposal.
Furthermore a lot of standard applications hadnt been developed. Now one of your customers, Fred
Flintstone, wants a command line calculator for his computer, the new Granite500 with 1000 hertz.
Your task is to write a command line calculator for him.
```

## Output

```text
Each line of input will consist of a string of length l, l < 255, containing a valid arithmetic expression.
Because main memory was very small in those days, the string will contain no blanks or tabs, nor
parathensis. It will contain the four standard arithmetic operators +, -, *,/ as well as a unary -
or + and floating point numbers. The input will be terminated by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, output the value of the arithmetic expression on a single line. The result should
contain three digits after the decimal point.

Hint: use double

```

## Sample Output

```text
1/2/2
-3.0
3
4.0+3.0/5.0
1*2*3+1+1*2+1*2*3*4

```
