title: Uva 00919  Cutting Polyominoes
---


## Input

```

A polyomino may be viewed as a set of squares connected by their sides. Its boundary is an orthogonal
polygon. They are often classified by their number of squares, which is equal to their area if each
square has area 1. We may represent a polymino in a grid as shown below. We are interested in
polyominoes without holes and that have exactly one edge in each grid line that intersects them. Did
you know that each polyomino results from a square (of area 1) by applying pairs of transformations
INFLATE/CUT? For example, the polyomino shown on the right is obtained if one applies IN-
FLATE (0,0), CUT (0,0), INFLATE (1,1), CUT (3,0), INFLATE (0,1), CUT (2,1), INFLATE
(1,2), CUT (0,5). It easy to see that it has area 12.

We are considering that the initial northwest corner is placed in (0,0) and that x and y grow as
in the figure. INFLATE (pi, qi) means multiplying by 4 the area of the cell (i.e. square) whose
northwest corner is in (p i, q i). For this, we must duplicate the grid line where this cell is located and
then duplicate the column where the cell was located. Obviously, we can drag down cells and then drag
other cells to the right. The coordinates of the polyomino are also modified: x > x+ 1 iff x > pi and
y > y + 1 iff y > qi. One cell can only be inflated if it belongs to the polyomino.

The sequence INFLATE (pi, qi) CUT ((xi, yi) means that one must cut the rectangle defined
by the points (pi + 1, qi + 1),(pi + 1, yi), (xi, yi),(xi, qi + 1). Such rectangle can only be cut if it
simultaneously satisfies the following conditions:

(A) it is actually a rectangle and it is part of the polyomino;

(B) (xi, yi) is a vertex of the inflated polyomino and none of the other vertices of the inflated polyomino
belongs to the rectangle (either to its interior or boundary);

(C) at least one of the points (xi, qi + 1) and (pi + 1, yi) is in an edge that contains (xii).

Your task is to write a program that computes the area of polyominoes that result from applying a
sequence of transformations INFLATE-CUT to squares of area 1.

## Output

```
The input is a sequence of descriptions of polyominoess constructions, ended by 0. Each description
starts with an integer r  50, which is the number of pairs INFLATE-CUT, followed by r rows, each
one with four integers pi, qi, xi, yi, that mean INFLATE (pi, qi) CUT (xi, yi). Observe that the
polyomino resulting from r INFLATE-CUTs has 2r + 4 vertices.

## Sample Input

```
Each line of the output will have the area of the constructed polyomino or 0 if any step in the
construction does not satisfy the rules just defined.
