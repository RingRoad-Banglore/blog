Natasha always mixes up things in her algorithm classes. Last week Prof. Chhaya Murthy gave the
class a classical problem - finding shortest path to all nodes from a specific node of a weighted graph.
Before that in another class, the professor taught them Prims and Dijkstras algorithms which are
similar looking but does very different things. Always confused, poor Natasha submitted something
very similar to the Prims algorithm (actually we should call it Natashas algorithm), she didnt test it
properly. Pseudocode of her algorithm looks as follows:

After submission, she showed the code to a friend who is good at algorithms. That friend immedi-
ately found the flaw. Natasha was really terrified and started to cry. Then there came the guys, the

guys who liked her. They jumped at the opportunity and got hold of the dataset to be used to test the
solutions. Your friend Rehan is one of those guys. He really wanted to impress Natasha. He asked you
to change the dataset in such a way that Natashas algorithm gives the right result. After the change,
Rehan will somehow be able to put the modified data with the old timestamp. Rehan told you that:

1. The dataset has T test cases.

2. Each case contains a connected weighted undirected graph with n nodes and m edges.

3. Each case will contain a source node source.

4. Edge weights are positive and distinct.

To avoid suspicion, Rehan asked you not to change which vertices the edges connect, or the overall
set of edge weights. You may only reorder which weights are assigned to which edges.

## Input

```
The first line of the input denotes the number of datasets T (1  T  15). T sets of case will follow.
Each case will start with a triplet of numbers n (2  n  2500), m (1  m  25000) and source
(1  source  n)  the number of nodes, the number of edges and the starting node respectively.
Each of the nextm lines will contain a triplet of numbers (u, v, w) meaning that there is an edge between
node u and node v with weight w (1  w  m). Nodes are numbered from 1 to n. It is guaranteed
that there is no duplicate or self-edges in the input and the graph is connected. In each given graph,
all edge weights will be distinct.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input, print one set of output. First line of a set should be of the format, Case X:
where X is the case number. Then print each edge triplet  one triplet (u, v and w) in each line
separated by a single space. The edges should be printed in the order given in the input. If there is
more than one solution to a dataset, any one of them will do.
