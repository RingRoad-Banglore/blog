```
John is learning number theory. His first lesson is about prime numbers. Like everyone, he loves prime
numbers. Unlike everyone, he started trying to generalize the idea of prime numbers. He first tried
to generalize the idea of prime numbers to a pair of number (a, b). To generalize he needed to define
addition and multiplication. He defined addition and multiplication and a function abs() in following
way,

(a1, b1) + (a2, b2) = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2)
(a1, b1)  (a2, b2) = (a1  a2  b1  b2, a1  b2 + a2  b1)

abs((a, b)) =


(a2 + b2)

He proved that if z1, z2 and z3 are pair of numbers then,

z1  z2 = z2  z1
z1  (z2 + z3) = z1  z2 + z1  z3
abs(z1  z2) = abs(z1)  abs(z2)

He says a pair of number to be prime if it cannot be written as a multiplication of two integer pair
of numbers both having absolute value greater than 1. So (2, 1) is prime while (5, 5) = (2, 1) * (3,1)
is not. Note that in this system prime factorization is not necessarily unique. As an example (5, 0) =
(1, 2) * (1, 2) = (2, 1) * (2, -1). The absolute value of (3, 4) is abs((3, 4)) = 5.

He wants to extend the idea further. He says a pair of pair or quad (p, q) where both p and q are
pair of integer. Multiplication, addition and absolute value are defined as below.

(p1, q1) + (p2, q2) = (p1 + q1, p2 + q2)
(p1, q1)  (p2, q2) = (p1  p2  q1  q2, p1  q2 + p2  q1)

abs((p, q)) =


abs(p)2 + abs(q)2)

For example,

((1, 2), (3, 4)) + ((5, 6), (7, 8)) = ((6, 8), (10, 12))

((1, 2), (3, 4))  ((5, 6), (7, 8)) = ((1, 2)  (5, 6) (3, 4)  (7, 8), (1, 2)  (7, 8) + (3, 4)  (5, 6))
= ((7, 16) (11, 52), (9, 22) + (9, 38)) = ((4,36), (18, 60))

He proved that if z1, z2 and z3 are quads then,

z1  z2 = z2  z1
z1  (z2 + z3) = z1  z2 + z1  z3
abs(z1  z2) = abs(z1)  abs(z2)

Again he will say a quad (p, q) to be integer if both p and q are integer pairs. A quad is said to be
prime if it cannot be written as multiplication of two quads both having absolute value greater than 1.
For example, ( (4, -36) , (18, 60) ) is not a prime while ( (5,2), (1,1) ) is.

John says a real number x to be cool if there is a quad z such that z is prime and abs(z) = x. So
(31) is cool as abs(((5, 2), (1, 1))) =


31. John is wondering how many cool numbers are there which

are not greater than a certain number.
