title: Uva 11656  Message in the Enemy Territory
---


## Input

```
A group of commandos has been caught and sent to a maximum-security prison in enemy territory. In
order to escape from the prison, a soldier needs to give a message to the squadron leader.

The boundary of the prison is protected by electronic alarms: for his security, the soldier needs to
keep a distance greater than m from the boundary. An additional restriction is that the soldier can
only stand on those positions with integer coordinates. In each step, the soldier can move, from a given
position (x, y), only to the nearby positions: (x1, y1), (x1, y), (x1, y+1), (x, y1), (x, y+1),
(x+ 1, y 1), (x+ 1, y) and (x+ 1, y+ 1), without going out of the interior of the prison. The walls of
the prison form a simple polygon (no repeated vertices and no intersections between edges) and all of
them are parallel to either the x-axis or the y-axis of a hypothetical coordinate system. The following
figure shows a typical prisons plan:

(xs, ys) and (xl, yl) corresponds to the position of the soldier and the squadron leader respectively.
The gray area indicates those positions that are at distance less than or equal to m from the prisons
boundary, i.e., the zone that the soldier cannot stand on.

A safe path is a sequence of pairs of integer coordinates, each one at a distance greater than m from
the boundary of the prison, so that consecutive pairs are different and do not differ in more than one
in each coordinate. In the depicted example, there is not a safe path from the soldier to the squadron
leader.

Your task is to determine, for a given prisons plan, if there exists a safe path from the soldier
position to the squadron leader position.

## Output

```
The problem input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of three lines:

 The first line contains two integer numbers separated by blanks, n and m, with 4  n  1000
and 1  m  30, indicating the number of the prisons boundary vertices and the alarm range
respectively.

 The second line contains a list of 2 n integer numbers, x1, y1, . . . , xn, yn, separated by blanks: the
list of vertices of a simple n-polygon that describes the boundary of the prison. 0  xi, yi  1000.

 The last line contains four integer numbers separated by blanks, xs, ys, xl, and yl, indicating the
position of the soldier and the position of the squadron leader (0  xs, ys  1000, 0  xl, yl 
1000).

The end of the input is indicated by a line with 0 0.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case the output includes a line with the word Yes if there exists a path from the soldier
to the squadron leader. Otherwise the word No must be printed.
