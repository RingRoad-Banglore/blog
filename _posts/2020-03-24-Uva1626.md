title: Uva 01626  Brackets sequence
---


## Input

```

Let us define a regular brackets sequence in the following way:

1. Empty sequence is a regular sequence.

2. If S is a regular sequence, then (S) and [S] are both regular sequences.

3. If A and B are regular sequences, then AB is a regular sequence.

For example, all of the following sequences of characters are regular brackets sequences:

(), [], (()), ([]), ()[], ()[()]

And all of the following character sequences are not:

(, [, ), )(, ([)], ([]

Some sequence of characters (, ), [, and ] is given. You are to find the shortest possible regular
brackets sequence, that contains the given character sequence as a subsequence. Here, a string a1a2 . . . an
is called a subsequence of the string b1b2 . . . bm, if there exist such indices 1  i1 < i2 < . . . < in  m,
that aj = bij for all 1  j  n.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The input file contains at most 100 brackets (characters (, ), [ and ]) that are situated on a
single line without any other characters among them.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

Write to the output file a single line that contains some regular brackets sequence that has the
minimal possible length and contains the given sequence as a subsequence.

## Sample Output
