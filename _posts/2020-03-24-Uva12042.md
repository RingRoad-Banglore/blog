## Input

```text
Little Mou is very fond of eggs. She has n baskets for keeping
her colorful eggs. Each basket contains eggs of different colors.
The baskets are numbered from 1 to n. She has a strange
hobby about these eggs. On each day, she takes each basket
starting from the n-th basket. When she is doing this for
basket i, she counts all eggs placed in baskets 1 to i (inclusive)
and takes their sum. Let this value of sum be counti. She
removes all old eggs from the ith basket and keeps counti new
eggs in the i-th basket. After that she puts all the old eggs of
the i-th basket in the (i 1)-th basket removing the old eggs
of the (i 1)-th basket. As Mou is very fond of eggs, she eats
all old eggs of the (i1)-th basket. And when she has finished
eating, she repeats the work for this (i  1)-th basket. If she
reaches the 1st basket, she stops her work and doesnt eat any
more eggs and goes to sleep!

For example let Mou has 3 baskets at day 1. 1st basket contains 1 egg, 2nd basket contains 1 egg
and the 3rd basket contains 2 eggs.

So simulation for day 3 follows:

Basket Index => 3 2 1
Day 1 At the end 2 1 1

Day 2 Initial 2 1 1
Step 1 2+1+1 2 1
Step 2 4 2+1 2
Step 2 4 3 2

Day 3 Initial 4 3 2
Step 1 4+3+2 4 2
Step 2 9 4+2 4
Step 3 9 6 4

Now the problem is given n, d and the number of eggs in each basket eggi, your job is to find the
number of eggs in each basket after d days. As the number can be very big output answer modulo
1,000,000,007.
