11714 Blind Sorting
I am a polar bear. But I am not just an ordinary polar bear. Yes I am extra ordinary! I love to play
with numbers. One day my very good friend Mr. Panda came to me, and challenged me to solve a
puzzle. He blindfolded me, and said that I have n distinct numbers. What I can ask is whether a-th
number is larger than b-th number and he will answer me properly. What I have to do is to find out the
largest and second largest number. I thought for a while and said “Come on, I will do it in minimum
number of comparison.”

## Input
There will be a non-negative integer, n in each of the line of input where n is as described above. n
will be less than any 10 digit prime number and not less than the smallest prime.

## Output
For each n, output number of questions that I have to ask Mr. Panda in the worst case.

## Sample Input
<p>2</p><p>4</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>1</p><p>4</p>
