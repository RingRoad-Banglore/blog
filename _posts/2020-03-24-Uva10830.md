title: Uva 10830  A New Function
---


## Input

```text
We all know that any integer number N is divisible by 1 and N . That is why these two numbers are not
the actual divisors of any numbers. The function SOD(n) (Sum of divisors) is defined as the summation
of all the actual divisors of an integer number n. For example SOD(24)=2+3+4+6+8+12=35. The
function CSOD(n) (cumulative SOD) of an integer n, is defined as below:

CSOD(n) =

i=n
i=1

SOD(i)

Given the value of n, your job is to find the value of CSOD(n).
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 50 lines of input. Each line contains an integer n (0  n  2000000000).
Input is terminated by a line where the value of n = 0. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line should contain the serial of output followed
by the value of CSOD(n). Look at the output for sample input for details. You can safely assume that
any output number fits in a 64-bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
100
200000000

```
