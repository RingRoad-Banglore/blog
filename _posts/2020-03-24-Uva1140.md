```
Charles Frdric Gros (CFG) has decided to disprove the Riemann hypothesis numerically. For a given
integer D > 0 of the form 4k + 3 and free of square prime factors, this amounts to computing the
cardinality h(D) of the set

C(D)
def
= {(a, b, c)|b2  4ac = D, |b|  a  c, where b  0 if a = c or a = |b|.

(Where a, b, c are integers.)
For instance, C(3) = {(1, 1, 1)}, C(15) = {(1, 1, 4), (2, 1, 2)}. Note that D = 75 is not eligible, since

75 = 3  52. Non-eligible numbers in the interval [3, 103] are {27, 63, 75, 99}.
CFG is interested in values of D for which h(D)/


D is large. Your role is to write a program to

help CFG finding these record numbers.
```

## Input

```
You are given an input file consisting of several test cases, each of them consists of three integers on a
single line:

Dmin Dmax K

where 3  Dmin  Dmax < 231 and are of the form 4k + 3. Moreover, Dmax  Dmin  106 and
K < 104. For such values, one has h(D) < 231.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, your program must determine the eligible values of D in the interval [Dmin,Dmax]
for which

f(D) =

(1000 h(D))/


D


 K.

The output will consist of lines:

D h f

where D is a record number, h = h(D) and f = f(D).
If no answer is found, then output a line containing the word empty.
Write a blank line to separate the output of two consecutive cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
3 103 0
27 27 10
