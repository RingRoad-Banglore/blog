---


```
Given a permutation of (1, 2, 3, . . . , n), find the length of the longest Anti-Monotonous subsequence of
this permutation, i.e. a subsequence A[0] . . . A[k] that satisfies:

A[0] > A[1] < A[2] > A[3] < . . . A[k]

Also,

1. Output the number of ways of generating this lenght modula 10000007.

2. Output the mean value of the lenghts of the longest Anti-Monotonous subsequence over all per-
mutations of (1, 2, 3, . . . , n). Round to integer.
```

## Input

```
For each test case, the first line contains the number n (0  n  100000) followed by n integers
representing the permutation.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a triple of integer followed by a new line  the length of the longest
subsequence, the number of the ways module 10000007, and the mean value of the lengths over all
permutations rounded to integer.

```

## Sample Input

```
10
1 9 2 3 4 10 5 7 8 6
5
2 4 1 3 5

```

## Sample Output

```
6 9 7
3 5 4
```
