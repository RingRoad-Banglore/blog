People of a certain country have a little interest in paying tax. This is not the case that they do not
love the country or they do not want to obey the law, but the problem is the complex calculations for
payable tax. Most of the people do not understand the rule and some lawyers take high charges to
help(?) them. So, most of the people just avoid paying tax. Realizing this, the Government decided
to automate the taxpaying system and appointed you to program a tax calculator that takes a persons
yearly income as input and calculate the payable tax for him. Here is the rule for calculate payable tax
for an individual:

1. The first 180,000/- of income is tax free.

2. Next 300,000/- will have 10% tax.

3. Next 400,000/- will have 15% tax.

4. Next 300,000/- will have 20% tax.

5. The rest will have 25% tax.

6. The minimum payable tax will be 2,000/-. That is if anyones tax is below 2,000/- (but of course
greater than zero) he must pay 2,000/-

7. The payable tax must be an integer. If the calculated tax is a floating point then it must be
replaced by the smallest integer greater than the payable tax.
