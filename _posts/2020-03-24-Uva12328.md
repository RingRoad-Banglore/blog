The Windows Minesweeper (WinMine) is one of the most well-known games on the Windows system.
The rule is quite easy and it takes only a few minutes to play a set. First of all, lets briefly introduce
this game (if you believe that you are familiar enough with this game, you can skip the next paragraph):

The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines (with the
left mouse button) without being destroyed by clicking on a mine. The location of the
mines is discovered by a process of logic. Clicking on the game board will reveal what is
hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank squares may be
revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other). Some squares are blank but some
contain numbers (1 to 8), each number being the number of mines adjacent to the uncovered
square. The game is won once all blank squares have been uncovered without hitting a mine,
any remaining mines not identified by flags being automatically flagged by the computer.
The distinctive feature of minesweeper is the randomness at the initial stage and at some
intermediate stages.

Jaddy loves playing WinMine at free time very much due to its
simplicity and ingenuity. However, sometimes it makes him frustrated
when he reaches some undeterminable states during the game. See the
following state (on the right) as an example:

In the red circle of this example, the rest two squares are absolutely
undeterminable and there are apparently two possible distributions of
the rest ONE mine.

When Jaddy gets into this kind of trouble, he has no choice but
to guess. Sometimes there are only two possible choices (as what the
example says) but sometimes there are many. This way, he needs an
assistant of this game to calculate the number of different possible dis-
tributions of mines depending on the current state of game board.

This assistant of game is pretty useful and interesting, at least for
him, so that he immediately starts coding. Unfortunately, Jaddy spent
all the time to play WinMine in the class of Programming and Algo-
rithm, so he feels such a complex task is a mission impossible. Jaddy
loves WinMine very much so that he asks you, an excellent programmer, for help. In addition, in order
to reduce the difficulty, he added three constraints:

1. It is guaranteed that the input state of game can always be created by making only ONE click
on the initial board.

2. In the given state, if two unrevealed squares are connected directly or by any other unrevealed
squares, they are also bi-connected. That is to say, even after any one of the other unrevealed
squares is removed, these two squares are still connected. Here we say two squares are connected
if and only if they share an edge. That means a square has at most four squares connected.

3. In the given state, if two numbers are connected by sharing an edge directly or by other numbers,
all the unrevealed cells adjacent to the connected set of numbers must be connected.

Help Jaddy please!

## Input

```
There are multiple test cases, the first line of input is a positive integer T (T  50) indicating the
number of test cases. Then T cases follow. For each test case, the first line contains three positive
integers n, m and M where 1  n, m  100 and 1  M  1500 denoting the number of rows and
columns in the given board and the total number of mines on the board. Then an n  m matrix of
chars describing the current state of board will be given. In this matrix, there are 2 styles of symbols:

1. digits from 0 to 8: that means the number of mines around this square (0 implies a blank square).

2. . (quotes for clarifying): that means this square is unrevealed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output an integer leading by the case number, denoting the number of possible
distribution of mine in the given state, module by 1000003. See the sample output for further details.
