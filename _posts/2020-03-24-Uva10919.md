```
Freddie the frosh has chosen
to take k courses. To meet
the degree requirements, he
must take courses from each
of several categories. Can
you assure Freddie that he
will graduate, based on his
course selection?
```

## Input

```
Input consists of several test
cases. For each case, the
first line of input contains
1  k  100, the number
of courses Freddie has cho-
sen, and 0  m  100, the
number of categories. One or
more lines follow containing
k 4-digit integers follow; each
is the number of a course se-
lected by Freddie. Each cat-
egory is represented by a line
containing 1  c  100, the
number of courses in the cat-
egory, 0  r  c, the mini-
mum number of courses from
the category that must be
taken, and the c course num-
bers in the category. Each
course number is a 4-digit in-
teger. The same course may
fulfil several category requirements. Freddies selections, and the course numbers in any particular
category, are distinct. A line containing 0 follows the last test case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line containing yes if Freddies course selection meets the degree require-
ments; otherwise output no.
