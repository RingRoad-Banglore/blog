title: Uva 11888  Abnormal 89s
---


## Input

```
A palindrome is a word that can be read the same way in either direction. More formally if a string is
d (d > 0) characters length and the i-th character is ai, the string is palindrome if and only if ai equals
a(di+1) for 1  i  d. For example abcba is palindrome while aaab is not.

It is known that everyone who gets to know palindromes, begin an emotional relationship with
these beautiful strings. The harmony between the letters makes them artistic. But the 89s (those
who entered AUT at 1389) claim they love another kind of strings. It is called alindrome. Actually
an alindrome is the result of concatenation of two palindromes. For example abacc=aba+cc is
alindrome.

Now you should write a program to distinguish alindromes, palindromes and other kind of strings.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains T (T  50), the number of tests. Each test that comes in a separate line contains
a string to be checked. Input strings contain only lower case letters (a to z) and their length will be
at most 200000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test output a single word in a single line. If the input string can be made by concatenating
two palindromes, output alindrome. Otherwise if its a palindrome output palindrome. In any other
case print simple. (Quotes for clarity)

```

## Sample Output

```
4
aaa
aabaa
aabaaa
abc

```
