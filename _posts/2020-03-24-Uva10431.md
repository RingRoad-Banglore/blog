title: Uva 10431  Normal Distribution

## Input

```text
One of the most important of the many distributions which occur in the study of statistics is the normal,
or Gaussian distribution. The equation of the normal curve is

f(x) =
1


2

e(x)
2/2 [1]

where f(x) is the frequency function. The total area under this curve, from x =  to x = +, is one
square unit. Therefore the area between any two points, say from x = a to x = b, is the proportion of
cases which lie between the two points. A plot of Eq. 1 yields a bell-shaped curve having a maximum
ordinate at x =  and decreasing to zero at both + and  If the standard deviation  is small, the
curve is tall and thin; if  is large, the curve is short and broad; see the Figure 1 below-

In order to analyze different statistical cases, it is convenient to replace x in Eq. 1 with the standard
variable z defined as

z =
x 


[2]

where now x is to be normally distributed with a mean of zero. Equation 1 then becomes a unit normal
distribution and is written as

f(x) =
1

The distribution is illustrated in the following figure, Figure 2.

The ordinate at z is f(z), obtained using Eq 3. The areas Q(z) and P (z) under the curve can be
found in statistical tables or approximated. Since the total area under the curve is unity

P (z) = 1Q(z) [4]

The term Q(z) is obtained by integrating the area under the curve. It can be approximated and
then programmed for calculation using a polynomial expansion (Hewlett-Packard Applications Book,
op. cit., p. 107). The results area found to be

Q(z) = f(z)(b1t+ b2t
2  b3t3 + b4t4 + b5t5) + (z) [5]

where
t =

1

1 + p|z|
, p = 0.2316419, || < 7.5 108

and b1 = 0.319381530, b2 = 0.356563782, b3 = 1.781477937, b4 = 1.821255978, b5 = 1.330274429.
From the above equation we can calculate Q(z) for any distribution.
In this problem you have to determine the standard deviation and mean of some given data. Then

for some given value find the number of population falling in the region Q(z) and P (z).

## Output

```text
The input consists of several segments. The first line of input of each segment is an integer N (0 <
N < 231) indicating the population. The next line contains N real numbers describing the population
data (such as age of people, length of shaft or diameter of bearing etc.). The following line contains an
integer Q (0 < Q < 1000) number of query. And the next line similarly contains Q number describing
the query.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input output the data set number followed by mean, standard deviation, then 3Q
numbers answering the queries. Each answer to query describes P (z) then Q(z) and then percentage
of population T falling in Q(z) area. Every number must be rounded to the nearest fourth digit after
the decimal point.
