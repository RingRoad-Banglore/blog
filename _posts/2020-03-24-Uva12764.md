title: Uva 12764  Exercising Emoticons
---


## Input

```

We are creating movies of an exercising stick man by combining
frames. There are 10 character frames, each 4 characters wide and
3 characters high (labeled 0-9):

0: \./. 1: .o.. 2: .... 3: .... 4: _o_.

.|.. /|\. .... .... .|..

/o\. /.\. __\o \_\o /.\.

5: \o/. 6: \o_. 7: \o/. 8: .... 9: .o..

.|.. \|.. \|/. .__o (.).

/.\. .|.. .... /..| /.\.

Note that dots in the frames are actually spaces, we used them here just to show that all frames
are of the same size and to remove any ambiguities that may appear from the difference in shapes.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains an integer M (1  M  100), the number of movies. Then follow M
lines, each containing a description of a movie as a sequence of N decimal digits, containing at least
one and not more than 72 digits.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each movie, output the corresponding sequence of frames as a single horizontal strip, with each
frame separated by a single space (do not print an extra space after the last frame).

Print a blank line after each movie. To clarify: for each test case your output will have 3 lines
with emoticons followed by a blank line. The number of characters on the lines containing an emoticon
should be exactly 5 N  1.

Make sure to replace dots with spaces in your output  see the sample output. Backslashes also
need to be escaped in order to be printed correctly.
