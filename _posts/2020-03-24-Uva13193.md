title: Uva 13193  Rotations

```
Humbertov Moralov in his student days, enrolled in the Systems Engineering program at University
of the Missing Hill in The Heavens Branch Office (Colombia, South America). He then attended a
course of Assembly Language (in the first half of 1997).

The course was fantastic, with very interesting topics such as bit manipulation, right shifts, left
shifts, rotations, masks and other bitwise operations (and, or, xor, not). And the best, in that course
he worked interesting programming challenges. One of those programming challenges follows.

The chosen programming challenge is named Rotations. By that time he used to work with
unsigned integers of eight bits (a byte), and the challenge consisted of figuring out if a particular
number n could generate all the eight numbers from 0 to 7 taking groups of consecutive bits of size 3.

For example, the number 226 has the binary representation 11100010 (b7b6b5b4b3b2b1b0), the eight
sequences of consecutive three-bits that can be generated are the following:

 b2b1b0 = (010)2 = 2

 b3b2b1 = (001)2 = 1

 b4b3b2 = (000)2 = 0

 b5b4b3 = (100)2 = 4

 b6b5b4 = (110)2 = 6

 b7b6b5 = (111)2 = 7

 b0b7b6 = (011)2 = 3

 b1b0b7 = (101)2 = 5

20 years have passed. Since today computers are more powerful and faster, the professor Humbertov
Moralov wants you to solve this programming challenge for unsigned integers of 32 bits (four bytes). You
must validate if the number n generates all the 32 numbers from 0 to 31 with sequences of consecutive
five-bits.
```

## Input

```
Input begins with an integer t (1  t  3105), the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each line
containing an integer n (0  n  4109).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, you should print a single line containing the word yes or no depending if the
integer number n produces or not all the numbers from 0 to 31 with sequences of consecutive five-bits.
