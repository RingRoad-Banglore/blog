Tangamandapios national competition is coming and it is time to write problems so all students are
very excited to present their own problems.

X likes subsequences and he wants to propose a problem about counting subsequences.
Y loves permutations and he wants to propose a problem that requires knowing if a string has

exactly K different permutations.
Both of them think that their own problem is the best.
Z is a friend of X and Y, and he wants to finish the discussion so he proposes to create a problem

that combines both problems in one.
Thus, they came with the following problem:

Given a string of text S count the number of subsequence that have exactly K different
permutations.

A string T is a subsequence of another string S, if deleting some elements from S and without
changing the order of the remaining elements, it is possible to get T .
```

## Input

```
There are multiple test cases. Each Test case contains two lines. The first line is a string S (1  |S| 
103) consisting of lowercase English alphabet. The second line contains an integer K (1  K  103).

```

## Output

```
For each test case print exactly one line containing one integer representing the number of subsequences
that have exactly K different permutations modulo 109 + 9.

```

## Sample Input

```

```

## Sample Output

```
