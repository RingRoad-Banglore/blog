title: Uva 11569  Lovely Hint
---


## Input

```text
Jay and Kay decide to play a game. They write an English sentence on a piece of paper. The objective
of the game is to pick out some of the written alphabets, rearrange them, and form the longest lovely
string.

The definitions of lovely string are simple:

1. It consists of upper case alphabets only, and it cannot be an empty string;

2. All alphabets are assigned a value. For example, A is assigned to be 1, B is assigned to be 2...etc;

3. For any substring of two alphabets, suppose the value of the first alphabet is V1 and that of the
second alphabet is V2. Then the following inequality must hold: 5 V1  4 V2.

Jay asks you to help him. However, as he does not want to lose the fun of the game, he asks you to
give him a hint only. Write a program to give the hint.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains an integer N (1  N  30). Each of the next N lines consists of a string S. The
string can be as long as 250 characters, and will not contain lower case alphabets.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the length of the longest lovely string that can be formed using the alphabets,
followed by the number of ways to achieve this length.

Explanation:
For the first case, we can get the lovely string EHLO.
For the second case, we can get AIMY and AJMY.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
HELLO.
I AM JAY.

```
