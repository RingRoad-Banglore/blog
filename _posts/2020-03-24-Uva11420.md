title: Uva 11420  Chest of Drawers
---


## Input

```
A chest of drawers means a wardrobe which has many drawers aligned ver-
tically as shown in the figure on the left. Although this is useful furniture,
some problems arise when all the drawers need have provisions of locking -
that is sometimes a drawer is not secured even if it is locked. For example
assume that the third drawer from the top is locked but the drawer immedi-
ately above it is not locked. Then the drawer that is locked is also not secured
because one can access it by pulling out the drawer immediately above it.

In a chest of n drawers, there are a number of ways to ensure that exactly
s drawers are secure. For example for the chest of drawers shown on the left,
exactly four drawers can be secured in six ways. These six ways are shown in
Figure 2.

Given the value of n and s, your job is to find out in how many ways they
can be secured.

Figure 2: In this figure L means that the drawer is locked and U means that the corresponding drawer
is unlocked. And here all six locking combinations are shown which ensures that exactly four drawers

are secured. Letters corresponding the secured drawers are boldfaced.
