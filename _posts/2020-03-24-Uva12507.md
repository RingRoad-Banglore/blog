title: Uva 12507  Kingdoms
---


## Input

```text
A kingdom has n cities numbered 1 to n, and some bidirectional roads connecting cities. The capital
is always city 1.

After a war, all the roads of the kingdom are destroyed. The king wants to rebuild some of the
roads to connect the cities, but unfortunately, the kingdom is running out of money. The total cost of
rebuilding roads should not exceed K.

Given the list of m roads that can be rebuilt (other roads are severely damaged and cannot be
rebuilt), the king decided to maximize the total population in the capital and all other cities that are
connected (directly or indirectly) with the capital (we call it accessible population), can you help
him?
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains a single integer T (T  20), the number of test cases. Each test case
begins with three integers n (4  n  16), m (1  m  100) and K (1  K  100, 000). The second
line contains n positive integers pi (1  pi  10, 000), the population of each city. Each of the following
m lines contains three positive integers u, v, c (1  u, v  n, 1  c  1000), representing a destroyed
road connecting city u and v, whose rebuilding cost is c. Note that two cities can be directly connected
by more than one road, but a road cannot directly connect a city and itself.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the maximal accessible population.
