title: Uva 13260  Alices Travels II
---


```
Alice is a merchant in the world. Layout of this world is a tree on N nodes (i.e., there is only one simple
path between any two cities). Each city has an infinite number of gems, each with cost Ti dollars and
brightness Si. Suppose Alice traveled from city U to city V on the shortest path and started with K
dollars, then the maximum total brightness (from gems purchased on her route, without exceeding K
dollars) she can achieve is a some function; lets call it f(K). Compute the following 2 quantities:

g(K) =

k
i=1

f(i) and h(K) = f(1)  f(2)     f(K) where  means XOR.
```

## Input

```
A number of inputs ( 20) described as follows. Input start with N , the number of cities (0 < N 
40000) and K (0 < K  61), the maximum dollars. This is followed by N  1 line consecutively, with
two numbers x and y between 1 and N on each line, specifying there is a road between cities x and y.
Next is a line with N numbers, which is the cost of the gems Ti (0 < Ti  K). This is followed by a
line with N integers, the brightness of the gems Si (0 < Si  106), The next line is an integer Q, the
number of inquiries (0 < Q  40000). Then Q lines, each line input two positive integer U , V , which
means Alice travels from city U to city V . Note that 1  x, y, U, V  N .

Output for each query, g(K) and h(K), separated by a space.
