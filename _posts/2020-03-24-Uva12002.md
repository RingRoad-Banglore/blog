title: Uva 12002  Happy Birthday
---


## Input

```
Today its February 13th. Its a very special day: Miguels birthday! Like every year, hes organised a
big celebration for all his friends. He prepared a succulent dinner at his house. Everyone had a lot of
fun and the celebration was a complete success.

Now its time for the not-so-funny cleaning up. He wants to start with moving all the dishes from
the table to the kitchen. Since hes been going to the gym lately, he feels strong enough to pile and
carry at once as many dishes as he wants. Time doesnt go unnoticed though: hes not as agile as he
used to be, so he can only carry the stack of dishes if its completely stable. A stack of dishes is stable
if each dish on the stack is bigger or equal in size than all the dishes above it. If the stack wasnt stable
he would drop the dishes and would have even more things to clean!

At the beginning of the scene, Miguel is empty-handed in one side of the table, walks along the
table finding and maybe collecting dishes of different sizes until he reaches the other side, and then
brings the collected dishes to the kitchen. When he finds a dish, he can:

 ignore the dish.

 if he has empty hands, pick up the dish.

 if he has a stack of dishes on his hands, pile the dish on top of the stack.

 if he has a stack of dishes on his hands, put the stack on top of the dish, then pick up the new
stack (including the dish).

Miguel is tired, so he wants to clean up the table as soon as possible. Hed like to take as many
dishes as he can in each run, but hes exhausted from the party and cant think clearly. Hes asked you
for help to find out what the maximum number of dishes he can collect in a single run is.
```

## Output

```
Input contains several datasets. Each dataset consists on two lines. The first line of each dataset
contains an integer N (1  N  500), the number of dishes on the table. The second line of each
dataset contains N integers, k1 . . . kN (1  ki  1000), specifying the size of each dish he finds, in the
same order he finds them. Input ends with a dataset with N = 0. This case shouldnt be processed.
