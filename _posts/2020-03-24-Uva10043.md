title: Uva 10043  Chainsaw Massacre

## Input

```
As every year the Canadian Lumberjack Society has just held its annual woodcutting competition and
the national forests between Montreal and Vancouver are devastated. Now for the social part! In order
to lay out an adequate dance floor for the evening party the organizing committee is looking for a large
rectangular area without trees. Naturally, all lumberjacks are already drunk and nobody wants to take
the risk of having any of them operate a chainsaw.

The organizing committee has asked you to find the largest yet free rectangle which could serve as
the dance floor. The area in which you should search is also rectangular and the dance floor must be
entirely located in that area. Its sides should be parallel to the borders of the area. It is allowed that
the dance floor is located at the borders of the area and also that trees grow on the borders of the dance
floor. What is the maximum size of the dance floor?
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input specifies the number of scenarios.

For each scenario, the first line provides the length l and width w of the area in meters (0 <
l,w  10000, both integers). Each of the following lines describes either a single tree, or a line of trees
according to one of the following formats:

 1 x y, where the one characterizes a single tree, and x and y provide its coordinates in meters
with respect to the upper left corner.

 k x y dx dy, where k > 1 provides the number of trees in a line with coordinates (x, y), (x +
dx, y + dy), . . . , (x+ (k  1)dx, y + (k  1)dy).

 0 denotes the end of the scenario.

The coordinates x, y, dx, and dy are given as integers. It is guaranteed that all the trees are situated
in the area, i.e. have coordinates in [0, l] [0, w]. There will be at most 1000 trees.
