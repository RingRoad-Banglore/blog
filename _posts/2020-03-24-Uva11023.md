title: Uva 11023  Multisets and Sequences
---


## Input

```text
In this problem we will deal with multisets and sequences. The definitions given here can differ (slightly)
from those you know or are generally accepted, so please read them carefully.

A multiset is a collection of, possibly not unique, natural numbers, called the elements of the
multiset. We denote a multiset by listing the elements in non-decreasing order, separated by commas
and enclosed in brackets. The number of elements in a multiset is called its size. The size of a multiset
can be zero, which means we have an empty multiset. Possible multisets are: (), (1), (-18,-17,-16) and
(1,3,3,3,4,5,5,6).

A sequence is a multiset where the elements are in a particular order. We denote a sequence by
listing the elements in the specific order, separated by commas and enclosed in braces. Like a multiset,
a sequence has a size and can be empty. Possible sequences are: {}, {1}, {1,2,3}, {2,3,1} and {25,-
18,25,25,7}.

Some sequences can be compared with each other. If two sequences have the same size and all
elements are the same and in the same order, we call them equal. If two sequences have the same size
and all elements are the same, but possibly in a different order, we call them similar. If two sequences
have the same size but possibly contain different elements, we call them comparable. We can negate these
properties by using the terms unequal, dissimilar and incomparable respectively. {1,2,2,3} and {1,2,2,3}
are equal, similar and comparable; {6,3,1,1} and {1,3,1,6} are unequal, similar and comparable; {1,2,3}
and {-988,7,-10} are unequal, dissimilar and comparable. Two sequences that have different sizes are
unequal, dissimilar and incomparable.

Two sequences that are unequal but comparable can be ordered. We do this by scanning both
sequences element by element, from left to right, until we encounter a difference between the sequences.
If the differing element in one sequence is smaller than its counter-element in the other sequence, the
first sequence is said to be smaller than the second. Using this ordering, we can sort any collection of
mutualy unequal but comparable sequences and determine the rank of a particular sequence within that
collection. The smallest sequence is said to have rank 0, the next smallest rank 1, etc. The collection of
the following sequences: {7,-1,8}, {1,1,1}, {-9,0,-3}, {1,1,0} can be sorted: {-9,0,-3}, {1,1,0}, {1,1,1},
{7,-1,8}. So {-9,0,-3} has rank 0 within the collection, {1,1,0} has rank 1, etc..

We will consider five kinds of operations on multisets and sequences in the form of commands:

1. We can degrade a sequence to form a multiset with the same elements.
The command to degrade a sequence is: degrade sequence. Example: degrade {6,3,-1,4,-1}
gives (-1,-1,3,4,6).

2. We can promote a multiset to form a sequence with the same elements. Because one multiset
can form a collection of similar sequences, we also need the rank of the sequence we want.
The command to promote a multiset is: promote multiset rank. Example: promote (4,6,8)
3 gives {6,8,4}.

3. We can determine the rank of a sequence within the collection of sequences that can be degraded
to the same multiset.
The command to rank a sequence is: rank sequence. Example: rank {8,6,9,6} gives 7.

4. We can derive a sequence of a certain size from a multiset, if that size is smaller than or equal
to the size of the multiset. Because a collection of comparable sequences can be derived from a
multiset, we also need the rank of the sequence we want.

The command to derive a sequence from a multiset is: derive multiset size rank. Example:
derive (1,1,2,2,3) 3 15 gives {3,1,2}.

5. Finaly we can find the rank of a sequence within the collection of comparable sequences of a
certain size that can be derived from the same multiset.
The command to find a sequence is: find sequence multiset. Example: find {5,8}
(0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9) gives 58. Notice that the size is not given explicitly in
the command because it is implicitly given with the sequence parameter.
```

## Output

```text
The input will consist of a series of commands as defined above, each on a line by itself and without the
surrounding quotes. Multisets and sequences will have a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 20 elements.
Elements are 32-bit signed integers. All commands will be valid. One space character will be used to
separate the command from its parameters and one space character wil be used between parameters.
There will be no spaces within multisets or sequences and no leading or trailing spaces. Command
names will be written in lowercase letters. The end of the input is indicated by the word end on a line
by itself. This line produces no output.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each command in the input print the result, either a number, multiset or sequence as defined above
on a line by itself and without the surrounding quotes. The output should not contain any space
characters. The elements of a multiset should be printed in non-decreasing order.

```

## Sample Output

```text
degrade {6,3,-1,4,-1}
promote (4,6,8) 3
rank {8,6,9,6}
derive (1,1,2,2,3) 3 15
find {5,8} (0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9)
end

```
