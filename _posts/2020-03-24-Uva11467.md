title: Uva 11467  Pythagorean Triangles
---


## Input

```text

Many lattice triangles are formed in an (N  N) grid, but not all of them are Pythagorean (Right
angled) triangles. Given the value of N your job is to write a program that produces the number of
lattice triangles in an (N N) grid. A lattice triangle is triangle whose three vertices are lattice points.
A lattice point in two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is a point whose abscissa and ordinate
are integers.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 15 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer N (0 < N < 2001).
Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each value of N produce one line of output which contains an integer T . Here T denotes the total
number of right angled triangles in that (N N) grid.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10

20
