title: Uva 11090  Going in Cycle
---


```
You are given a weighted directed graph with n vertices and m edges. Each cycle in the graph has a
weight, which equals to sum of its edges. There are so many cycles in the graph with different weights.
In this problem we want to find a cycle with the minimum mean.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with two
numbers n and m. m lines follow, each has three positive number a, b, c which means there is an edge
from vertex a to b with weight of c.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output one line containing Case #x: followed by a number that is the lowest mean
cycle in graph with 2 digits after decimal place, if there is a cycle. Otherwise print No cycle found..

Constraints

 n  50

 a, b  n

 c  10000000

```

## Sample Input

```
2
2 1
1 2 1
2 2
1 2 2
2 1 3

```

## Sample Output

```
Case #1: No cycle found.
Case #2: 2.50
```
