```
In the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation), a chessboard is described as follows:

 The Board-Content is specified starting with the top row and ending with the bottom row.

 Character / is used to separate data of adjacent rows.

 Each row is specified from left to right.

 White pieces are identified by uppercase piece letters: PNBRQK.

 Black pieces are identified by lowercase piece letters: pnbrqk.

 Empty squares are represented by the numbers one through eight.

 A number used represents the count of contiguous empty squares along a row.

 Each rows sum of numbers and characters must equal 8.

As for example:

5k1r/2q3p1/p3p2p/1B3p1Q/n4P2/6P1/bbP2N1P/1K1RR3,

is the FEN notation description of the following chessboard:

The chessboard of the beginning of a chess game is described in FEN as:

rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR

Your task is simple: given a chessboard description in a FEN notation you are asked to compute
the number of unoccupied squares on the board which are not attacked by any piece.
