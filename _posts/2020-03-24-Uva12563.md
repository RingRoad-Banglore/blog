## Input

(If you smiled when you see the title, this problem is for you ^_^)

For those who dont know KTV, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke_box

There is one very popular song called Jin Ge Jin Qu(). It is a mix of 37 songs, and is
extremely long (11 minutes and 18 seconds)  I know that there are Jin Ge Jin Qu II and III, and
some other unofficial versions. But in this problem please forget about them.

Why is it popular? Suppose you have only 15 seconds left (until your time is up), then you should
select another song as soon as possible, because the KTV will not crudely stop a song before it ends
(people will get frustrated if it does so!). If you select a 2-minute song, you actually get 105 extra
seconds! ....and if you select Jin Ge Jin Qu, youll get 663 extra seconds!!!

Now that you still have some time, but youd like to make a plan now. You should stick to the
following rules:

 Dont sing a song more than once (including Jin Ge Jin Qu).

 For each song of length t, either sing it for exactly t seconds, or dont sing it at all.

 When a song is finished, always immediately start a new song.

Your goal is simple: sing as many songs as possible, and leave KTV as late as possible (since we
have rule 3, this also maximizes the total lengths of all songs we sing) when there are ties.

## Output

```text
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  100). Each test case begins with two positive
integers n, t (1  n  50, 1  t  109), the number of candidate songs (BESIDES Jin Ge Jin Qu)
and the time left (in seconds). The next line contains n positive integers, the lengths of each song, in
seconds. Each length will be less than 3 minutes  I know that most songs are longer than 3 minutes.
But dont forget that we could manually cut the song after we feel satisfied, before the song ends. So
here length actually means length of the part that we want to sing.

It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of all songs (including Jin Ge Jin Qu) will be strictly larger
than t.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the maximum number of songs (including Jin Ge Jin Qu), and the total lengths
of songs that youll sing.

Explanation:
In the first example, the best we can do is to sing the third song (80 seconds), then Jin Ge Jin Qu

for another 678 seconds.
In the second example, we sing the first two (30+69=99 seconds). Then we still have one second

left, so we can sing Jin Ge Jin Qu for extra 678 seconds. However, if we sing the first and third song
instead (30+70=100 seconds), the time is already up (since we only have 100 seconds in total), so we
cant sing Jin Ge Jin Qu anymore!
