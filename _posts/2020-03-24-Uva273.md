title: Uva 00273  Jack Straws
---


## Input

```text
In the game of Jack Straws, a number of plastic or wooden straws are dumped on the table and players
try to remove them one-by-one without disturbing the other straws. Here, we are only concerned with
if various pairs of straws are connected by a path of touching straws. You will be given a list of the
endpoints for some straws (as if they were dumped on a large piece of graph paper) and then will be
asked if various pairs of straws are connected. Note that touching is connecting, but also two straws
can be connected indirectly via other connected straws.
```

## Output

```text
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

A test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line will be an integer n (1 < n < 13) giving
the number of straws on the table. Each of the next n lines contain 4 positive integers, x1, y1, x2 and
y2, giving the coordinates, (x1, y1), (x2, y2) of the endpoints of a single straw. All coordinates will be
less than 100. (Note that the straws will be of varying lengths.) The first straw entered will be known
as straw #1, the second as straw #2, and so on. The remaining lines of input (except for the final line)
will each contain two positive integers, a and b, both between 1 and n, inclusive. You are to determine
if straw a can be connected to straw b. When a = 0 = b, the input is terminated.

There will be no illegal input and there are no zero-length straws.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

You should generate a line of output for each line containing a pair a and b, except the final line
where a = 0 = b. The line should say simply CONNECTED, if straw a is connected to straw b, or NOT
CONNECTED, if straw a is not connected to straw b. For our purposes, a straw is considered connected
to itself.
