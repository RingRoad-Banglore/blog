title: Uva 00791  Term Reductions
---


## Input

```text

Input terms are defined inductively as follows:

1. X is a term;

2. if A and B are terms, then (A B) is also a term;

3. no other terms.

The terms are transformed by the rewriting rule: the pattern (((X A) B) C), where A, B, and C
are terms, is replaced by ((A C)(B C)).

Reducing a term means applying this rule. A term is called reduced if it contains no subterm that
can be further reduced. A term is considered as a subterm of itself, too.

Write a program that reads input terms and writes the corresponding reduced terms.
```

## Output

```text
The input file will contain several lines with one term per line. Each line will contain no more than 80
characters. The input terms will be syntactically correct. Possible input characters are X, (, and )
(without blanks in between). The input data will be terminated by a line containing a single character
0 (zero).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input term, write its corresponding reduced term in a line, followed by a line containing digits
in positions in which output term has parentheses, and an empty line. A term without parentheses must
be followed by two empty lines. These digits mark the nesting level of parentheses in the corresponding
positions. It is guaranteed that the maximum nesting level is less than 9, and that the number of
reductions is finite, and that the output lines will be shorter than 80 characters. The top level is
denoted by 0. Possible characters in the output terms are also X, (, and ).

```

## Sample Output

```text
(((XX)X)X)

(((XX)(XX))X)

(XX)

0

```
