title: Uva 11482  Building a Triangular Museum
---


```

You are an architect now; you work for a firm as a head architect. People find you smart and brilliant.
You have already showed your talent in some sources. Thats why your popularity is growing day by
day. And of course who doesnt enjoy such popularity!

Your firm has recently got a job. The job is quite simple. You have to build a museum, actually
a Triangular Museum. The shape of the museum will be triangular and the rooms inside it will be
triangular, too. And the overall building process is given below:

You will be given two numbers M and N . N denotes the number of levels and M denotes the size.
That means you have to build a museum which should have N levels, the first level will contain one
triangular room.

Now, for building a triangular room of size M , first you have to put

/\ (forward slash and a backward slash)

Then for each i-th row (i = 2 to M  1), you have to put a / (forward slash) and 2  (i 1) spaces
and after that a \ (backward slash). The M -th row will contain a /, 2  (M  1) _ (underscore) and
a \. And add spaces to the previous parts so that the overall shape looks fully triangular. Suppose,
M = 4. Then a room will be like:

.../\

../..\

./....\

/______\

(Here spaces are shown as dots)

Now, for building all the N levels, for each i-th level (i = 2 to N), you have to build i triangular
rooms, each will start from the base vertices of the previous triangular rooms. (Note that the first level
will contain one room only). If N = 1 and M = 2. Then the museum will be like:

./\

/__\

If N = 2 and M = 2. Then the museum will be like: (Two triangular rooms added)

.../\

../__\

/\../\

/__\/__\

If N = 3 and M = 2. Then the museum will be like: (Three triangular rooms added)

...../\

..../__\

.../\../\

../__\/__\

./\../\../\

/__\/__\/__\

Now given M and N , your job is to build the triangular museum.

## Input

```
Input contains several sets of inputs. Each set contains two integers M (1 < M  100) and N
(1  N  100). A line containing two zeroes denotes the end of input.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input. First print Triangular Museum x (where x denotes the set number starting
from 1) in a single line. Then draw the triangular museum according to the description.

Finally print a blank line.
