title: Uva 13037  Chocolate

```
Leju, Rony and Sujon are cousins and have collected L, R & S chocolates respectively. The chocolates
come into different types. They have numbered each type by a distinct nonnegative integer of at most
five digits.

After their chocolate collection, Rony found out something and said, Why both of you have some
types of chocolates that I dont have? While Leju and Sujon were looking at each other for answer,
Rony realised something more and said, Oh, no worries! I have some types of chocolates that neither
of you have!

Now, you being their older cousin, they have come to you for help. You will have to find out how
many types of chocolates each of the boys has while none other have that type. You will also have to
find the number of types of chocolates each of the boys does not have while all the others have that
type.
```

## Input

```
First line of input will contain an integer T ( 15), the number of test cases. For each test case, there
are three positive integers: L, R, S on the first line (L,R, S  105). Each of next three lines will contain
L, R, S integers; the type of chocolates Leju, Rony & Sujon respectively possesses.

```

## Output

```
Begin output of each test case by a line Case #x: where x is the case no (starting from 1). Then
three lines follow, first one for Leju, second one for Rony and last one for Sujon. Each of these lines
will contain 2 integers, separated by a space. First number will denote how many types of chocolates
respective boy has but none other have. And, second one will denote how many chocolates both the
others have but the respective boy does not.

Note: Lets review the third test case below:

Boy All Chocolates possessed
by respective boy

Chocolates which are pos-
sessed by respective boy
(while none of other two
boys do)

Chocolates which are not
possessed by respective
boy (while both of other
two boys do)

Leju 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66 66 <none>
Rony 11, 22, 77, 88 77, 88 33, 44, 55
Sujon 33, 44, 55 <none> 11, 22

```
