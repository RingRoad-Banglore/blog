## Input

```text
I mean, some people got guns, and some
people got flashlights, and some people got

batteries. These guys had all three.
J. Michael Straczynski, "Jeremiah."

Markus is building an army to fight the evil Valhalla Sector, so he needs to move some supplies
between several of the nearby towns. The woods are full of robbers and other unfriendly folk, so its
dangerous to travel far. As Thunder Mountains head of security, Lee thinks that it is unsafe to carry
supplies for more than 10km without visiting a town. Markus wants to know how far one would need
to travel to get from one town to another in the worst case.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a line
containing n (the number of towns, 1 < n < 101). The next n lines will give the xy-locations of each
town in km (integers in the range [0, 1023]). Assume that the Earth is flat and the whole 1024 1024
grid is covered by a forest with roads connecting each pair of towns that are no further than 10km away
from each other.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the line Case #x:, where x is the number of the test case. On the next
line, print the maximum distance one has to travel from town A to town B (for some A and B). Round
the answer to 4 decimal places. Every answer will obey the formula

|ans  104  ans  104  0.5| > 102

If it is impossible to get from some town to some other town, print Send Kurdy instead. Put an
empty line after each test case.
