## Input

```text

Has it ever happened to you that, having worked on a problem for a long time, it starts to pop up in
your conscious mind when you least expect it? Just the other day I was singing that old song that goes
Something in the way she moves. . . , but before I knew it, I replaced part of the lyrics with Sum-thing
in the way she woos me. . . . The only explanation I have for this is that I had been working recently
on a curious mathematical problem concerning sums. It goes something like this:

Consider a list A with n positive integers, A1, A2, A3, . . . , An. A function S is defined as follows, for
1  k  n:

S(k) = 2k1
n

i1=1

n
i2=i1+1

n
i3=i2+1

  
n

ik=ik1+1

Ai1Ai2Ai3   Aik

For example, if A = (1, 2, 3), then the possible values of S are:

S(1) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

S(2) = 2  ((1  2) + (1  3) + (2  3)) = 2(2 + 3 + 6) = 22
S(3) = 4  (1  2  3) = 4  6 = 24

What the problem asks is, given the list A, find the sum:

 =
n

k=1

S(k)
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T , the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n in the
first line. The second line of each case contains n positive integers, separated by spaces, that form the
set A.

T  10; 1  n  105; 1  Ai  109 for 1  i  n

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the value of , modulo 1000000009 (109 + 9) on a single line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2

3

1 2 3

5

2 3 5 7 11

```
