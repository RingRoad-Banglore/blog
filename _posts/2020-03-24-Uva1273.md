title: Uva 01273  Weiqi

## Input

```

Weiqi is an intellective game from ancient China, which was said that come from simulation of wars on
table in legend. People play Weiqi on a board with 19 horizontal lines and 19 vertical lines intersected
by each other. Two players put black or white cobble onto one of 361 intersect points on the board one
by one. The player which have control of more intersect points at last win the game.

There are several rules of Weiqi:

 There are no black or white cobbles on the board before the game begins. Black select one
intersect point on the board to put on his cobble first, then white, one by one, and so on. Cobble
put on point that already put cobble before is invalid, the player which put that cobble on will
be considered as pass. Player put one cobble on calls one turn. Player can also chose pass when
in his turn.

 Any cobbles that conjoints to other on vertical or horizontal lines calls one block of cobbles. A
block of cobbles calls dead block if there are no empty intersect point but cobbles in same color
or other color conjoints up, down, left, or right to every one cobble of the block. Any cobbles of a
dead block should be taken away from the board. All black cobbles are dead ones in figure below:

 Cobble put on the board then a block of cobbles in the other color becomes dead block and be
taken away from the board calls beat. One intersect point calls taboo point if cobble put on
will make one block of cobbles in same color become dead block and cant beat any cobbles in the
other color, or status of the board after take away any dead blocks same as that before opponent
players last turn. The cobble must be take away from the board and resume the status before
that putting, then the player put that cobble is considered to chose pass. X in figure below shows
taboo points:

 It calls same loop if the status of board after ones valid put is same to before and there are no
any pass in that loop. The game is tie if appears same loop and players replay the game
then. There is a sample of three conflicts loop (one kind of same loop) in figure below.

The problem request you to write a program that read data of two players playing and simlulate
the course of the game Weiqi.
```

## Output

```
There are data groups of several games in one input file. Every data group consists of a sequence of
integer a, b (1  a, b  19) pairs. One integer pair a, b indicates the intersect point that the player
want put his cobble on, which a indicates the horizontal line number through the point (from 1 to 19
indicates top to bottom) and b indicates the number of vertical line through the point (from 1 to 19
indicates left to right); a = b = 0 indicates that pass by the player. The first pair indicates the point
that black cobble put, next white, one by one, and so on. The data after last turn of a tie game will
auto begins a new game, however, black will put first cobble on the board even the last turn of tie game
is also played by black. The game is over while black and white pass by player too. The input is ended
by a game with first pair that a = b = 1.

```

## Sample Input

```
Program should output Game #x in a single line where x is an integer from 1. You should output
information below in a single line while one player pass his turn:

Turn XXX PLAY ER pass (taboo point A,B) while point A,B is taboo point;
Turn XXX PLAY ER pass (invalid put A,B) while PLAY ER cant put his cobble

on point A,B;
Turn XXX PLAY ER pass (by player) while PLAY ER chosed pass.

where PLAY ER is white or black; A,B is the intersect point that player want to put his cobble
on; XXX means number of turns when the player put his cobble.

Your program should output Total XXX turn(s) in a single line first, where XXX is the total
number of turns of the game while the game is over or tie; your program should plus one line with
(Tie) if the game is tie. Then output the status of board which should consists of 19 lines, each
line consists 19 characters, indicates status of 361 intersect points, where e indicates black cobble; o
indicates white cobble and + indicates empty point. Output should be left to right, top to bottom
corresponds to the board. Your program must output one empty line after any case and no more empty
line or empty space in line.
