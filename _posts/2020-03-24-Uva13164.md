title: Uva 13164  Performance Review
---


## Input

```
Employee performance reviews are a necessary evil in any com-
pany. In a performance review, employees give written feedback
about each other on the work done recently. This feedback is
passed up to their managers which then decide promotions based
on the feedback received.

Maria is in charge of the performance review system in the
engineering division of a famous company. The division follows a
typical structure. Each employee (except the engineering direc-
tor) reports to one manager and every employee reports directly
or indirectly to the director.

Having the managers assessing the performance of their direct
reports has not worked very well. After thorough research, Maria
came up with a new performance review system. The main idea
is to complement the existing corporate structure with a technical
rank for each employee. An employee should give feedback only
about subordinates with lower technical level.

Hence, the performance review will work as follows. Employ-
ees prepare a summary of their work, estimate how much time it takes to review it, and then request
their superiors with higher technical rank to review their work.

Maria is very proud of this new system, but she is unsure if it will be feasible in practice. She
wonders how much time each employee will waste writing reviews. Can you help her out?

Given the corporate structure of the engineering division, determine how much time each employee
will spend writing performance reviews.

The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line of input has one integer E, the number of employees, who are conveniently numbered

between 1 and E. The next E lines describe all the employees, starting at employee 1 until employee
E. Each line contains three space-separated integers mi ri ti, the manager, the technical rank and
the expected time to perform the review of employee i. The engineering director has no manager,
represented with mi = 1. The other employees have mi between 1 and E.
