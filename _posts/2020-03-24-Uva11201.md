title: Uva 11201  The Problem of the Crazy Linguist
---


```
Please, help the crazy linguist! He is trapped in his madness. He has developed a Spanish Beauty
Criterion for words. It is defined as follows. Given a word w

w = x1x2x3 . . . xn

(where n is the length of the word), he is interested in words which are formed by letters following
pattern:

xi 
{
{bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz} if i is odd
{aeiou} if i is even

and, also, in his madness, he wont allow a word that actually has i, j, and k, so that xi = xj = xk
(that is, any letter can appear in the word at most two times).

Then, the Spanish Beauty Criterion (SBC) is defined as:

SBC(w) =


i1...n
i  P (xi)

where P is defined as the probability of appearance of a letter in Spanish, defined by the following
table:

a b c d e f g h i j k l m
12.53 1.42 4.68 5.86 13.68 0.69 1.01 0.70 6.25 0.44 0.00 4.97 3.15

n o p q r s t u v w x y z
6.71 8.68 2.51 0.88 6.87 7.98 4.63 3.93 0.90 0.02 0.22 0.90 0.52

So, given a word w, of size n, our poor linguist wants to know if this word is above or below
the average of the SBC of all the words of size n that can be constructed following the
above pattern and start with the same letter than w.
```

## Input

```
The input will have a first line with a number, N , the number of samples that will be entered to know
if they are above or below the average. Following this first line, N lines with a word in each one (of at
most seven characters each). All the input words follow the given pattern.

```

## Output

```
The output will have N lines, each line corresponding to one input word in order, showing just above
or equal or below, depending on the value of the SBC of that word relative to the average of those
of the same size.

```

## Sample Input

```

terabit
hacer
qed
