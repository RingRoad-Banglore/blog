## Input

```
The lottery BWS is played annually. In this lottery N people bet choosing K numbers each. In a
formal way, we can say that Bij is the j-th value bet by the i-th person. Then the organizers choose K
positive integers. The chosen numbers are called W1, W2, , WK .

The winners are calculated as followed:

 A non-empty subset is chosen randomly from the N participants; in other words, some participants
are luckily chosen.

 For each person in this subset the value S1 is calculated, the sum of all the first numbers bet by
them, that is, the sum of the Bi1 where i is the index of each chosen person. In the same way the
values S2, , SK are calculated.

 A parity test between Wj and Sj is performed; in other words, it is verified if the parity (if a
number is pair or odd) matches between W1 and S1, W2 and S2, and so on until WK and SK .

 If all parities match, then the people in this subset are considered the winners!

The organizers want to know: is it possible to pick the numbers W1, W2, , WK so that there is no
subset of winning participants?
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains the numbers N (1 
N  30000) and K (3  K  50), which represent the number of participants and the quantity of
numbers bet by each person, respectively. The participants bet with integer numbers between 1 and
109, inclusive. Each of the next N lines contains K numbers representing the bet of each person, one
person per line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input you must output a single line, containing one letter: S in case it is
possible or N otherwise.
