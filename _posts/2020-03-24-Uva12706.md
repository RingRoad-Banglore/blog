title: Uva 12706  Zero-Knowledge Protocol
---


## Input

```text

In cryptography, a zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to
another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any additional information
apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. We can extend these ideas to verify whether
anyone has properly find any pattern in a data stream without enclosing which position these pattern
is found.

So, in this problem, you have to exactly match multiple pattern of length M in a number stream of
length N and prove it in zero-knowledge protocol. A pattern P of length M will exactly match with a
sub-pattern of stream S in i-th index, if and only if,

P [1 . . .M ] = S[i . . . i+M  1], i+M  1  N

In such case you have to sum i2 in zero-knowledge protocol and verify it. You can assume that all the
pattern indexing is 1-based.

But, due to laziness and painfulness of generating multiple patterns, you have to use all the distinct
permutations of given pattern P as multiple patterns.

## Output

```text
First line of input will contain the number of test cases, T  50 to follow. Each test case starts with a
line given N and M . Then follows two lines. First line contains N numbers si (1  i  N) to denote
number stream S and the next line contains M numbers pi (1  i  M ) to denote pattern P .
Constraints

 1  N,M  2  104

 1  si, pi  109

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the total sum of squared match index in a single line. See the samples for exact
formatting.

Output Explanation
On the first test case two distinct permutation of P is possible. Pattern [10 11] is exactly matched

with S in index 1 and pattern [11 10] is matched in index 2. So total sum in zeroknowledge protocol is
12 + 22 = 5.

On the second test case three distinct permutation of P is possible. Pattern [10 11 11] is exactly
matched with S in index 1 and pattern [11 11 10] is matched in index 2. Pattern [11 10 11] doesnt
match anywhere. So total sum in zero-knowledge protocol is 12 + 22 = 5.
