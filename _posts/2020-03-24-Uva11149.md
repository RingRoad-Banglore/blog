## Input

```
Consider an n-by-n matrix A. We define Ak = A  A  . . .  A (k times). Here,  denotes the usual
matrix multiplication.

You are to write a program that computes the matrix A+A2 +A3 + . . .+Ak.

Example

Suppose A =


 0 2 00 0 2

0 0 0


. Then A2 =


 0 2 00 0 2

0 0 0





 0 2 00 0 2

0 0 0


 =


 0 0 40 0 0

0 0 0


, thus:

A+A2 =


 0 2 00 0 2

0 0 0


+


 0 0 40 0 2

0 0 0


 =


 0 2 40 0 2

0 0 0




Such computation has various applications. For instance, the above example actually counts all the
paths in the following graph:
```

## Output

```
Input consists of no more than 20 test cases. The first line for each case contains two positive integers n
( 40) and k ( 1000000). This is followed by n lines, each containing n non-negative integers, giving
the matrix A.

Input is terminated by a case where n = 0. This case need NOT be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, your program should compute the matrix A+A2 +A3 + . . .+Ak. Since the values may
be very large, you only need to print their last digit. Print a blank line after each case.

```

## Sample Output

```
3 2
0 2 0
0 0 2
0 0 0
0 0
