title: Uva 11843  Guessing Game
---


```
Alice and Bob love games, but they have already played every single game available at their local
Games R U (Games foR U) store. Tired of playing the same games over and over again, and from not
receiving news from the game store, they decided to create their own game. After a few weeks of hard
intellectual work Alice came up with Guessing Game, a two player game consisting in Alice picking a
number and letting Bob try to guess it.

Before playing the game, Alice and Bob agree in the size of the game, given by two integer positive
numbers, the range N and the limit of strikes S. Alice chooses a secret integer number X, 0  X < N .
Then Bob uses turns telling Alice integer numbers in order to guess her choice. Each Bobs guess is
answered by Alice with a strike, if Bobs number is greater than X, with a smile, if Bobs number is
less than X, or with a stop, if Bobs number is precisely X. In this last case the game ends and Bob
wins. If Bob receives S strikes the game ends with Alice as winner.

Bob is very competitive. He wants to develop a winning strategy and he starts trying to do it in
the case N = 3 and S = 2. He notes that guessing 1 in the first turn suffices to win: if he receives a
strike, Alices number must be 0 and he can guess it in the next turn; if Alices number is 1, he already
wins; otherwise, he receives a smile, and Alices number must be 2. Either way he manages to guess
the right number without receiving 2 strikes.

Before facing Alice in an official match, Bob asks for a little help with his training. Indeed, he wants
you to make a program that computes the minimum number of guesses needed by him to guess any
number X, 0  X < N , receiving at most S  1 strikes.

## Input

```
Input consists of several test cases. The first line of the input file contains a number C specifying
the number of cases in the file. Then C lines follow, each one containing two integer numbers N
and S, separated by a blank and representing the range and the limit of strikes of a Guessing Game,
respectively. You may assume that 1  N  1000 and 1  S  20.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, a single line containing an integer number indicating the minimum number of guesses
needed by Bob to guess every possible number picked by Alice.
