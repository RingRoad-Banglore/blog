title: Uva 11594  All Pairs Maximum Flow
---


## Input

```
We must respect the other fellows religion, but only in the sense and to the extent that we
respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart.

H. L. Mencken

Given a square, symmetric matrix of edge capacities, return a square, symmetric matrix of maximum
flows.

In ther words, you have n nodes. Between each pair of nodes, there is a pipe of a certain thickness
(measured in liters per second, possibly zero). For each pair of nodes, (A,B), return the the maximum
speed at which fluid can be pushed from node A to node B, in liters per second. Note that the flow for
each pair of nodes is maximized separately  there is no need to push all n2 flows simultaneously.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a
line containing n (0  n  200). The next n lines will each contain n integers (between 0 and 10000
(inclusive)).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by n lines with n integers each. The
diagonal should of this matrix should contain only zeroes.
