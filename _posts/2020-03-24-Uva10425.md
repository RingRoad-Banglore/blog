title: Uva 10425  Mobile Destroyer
---


## Input

```
Year 2020.

In order to reduce the use of stolen mobile sets in Dhaka city, DMP is planning to place two
Advanced Mobile Destroyers (AMDs) on two tall towers of the city. Each AMD has a sphere of action.
If a stolen mobile set is found within this sphere (even on the boundary), the AMD erases the mobile
sets flash memory, making the set useless.

But there is a bug in the program of the AMD itself: If a stolen set is on the plane passing through
the common points of the boundaries of the spheres of two AMDs, no AMD takes any action at all!

Given the position and the radius of the sphere of two AMDs and the position of a stolen set, you
are to determine the fate of the set.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several test cases.

Each case consists of case name followed by 11 integers on the same line. The case name contains
exactly 5 alphanumeric characters. The first 4 integers are the position (x, y, z) and the radius r of the
sphere of AMD#1. Next 4 integers are the position (x, y, z) and the radius r of the sphere of AMD#2.
The last 3 integers are the position (x, y, z) of the stolen set. Each integer in the input is smaller than
32000 in absolute value. The two spheres of action always intersect each other.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each data set, print 4 lines.

The first line gives the case name. The second line and third line indicates whether the stolen set
is within the range of AMD#1 & AMD#2 respectively (y if within range, n otherwise). The fourth
line is y if the stolen set has been made useless, n otherwise.

## Sample Output

```
Dhk01 0 0 0 8 10 0 0 8 5 5 5
Dhk02 0 0 0 8 10 0 0 8 5 0 0
