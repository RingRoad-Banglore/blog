title: Uva 10483  The Sum Equals the Product
---


## Input

```text
One day in a supermarket I witnessed the following scene. A young man put 3 items onto the conveyor
belt and watched the cashier entering the numbers. He noticed that the cashier did not add the 3 prices
but multiplied them! He of course was not willing to pay the final outcome which appeared on the
electronic display and asked for the manager to come. In the mean time the young man took a piece of
paper, wrote down the 3 prices and added them up. For some strange reason the result was precisely
the same. He paid the sum (which was also the product) and left. This equality only appears with very
special triplets of numbers. I remember the sum (or product) beeing within a certain range (between
$ 5.70 and $ 6.10). But, what were the 3 prices?
```

## Output

```text
The input contains two numbers specifying the range, separated by a space. The sum (or product) is to
be within this range. Both numbers are positive (< 256.00) and have 2 digits after the decimal point.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each special triplet found (with the sum of the 3 prices being the same as their product) with sum
(and product) within the range, the output contains one line in the format:

sum = a+ b+ c = a  b  c

Where a, b and c are the 3 prices in ascending order. The output lines shall start with the smallest sum
(or product) within the range and also be in ascending order. In the special case of multiple solutions
for one and the same sum (or product), the first line shall be the one containing the smallest price (a).

All numbers (sum, a, b, c) are printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

```

## Sample Output

```text
5.70 6.10

```
