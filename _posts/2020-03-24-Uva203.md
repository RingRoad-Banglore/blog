Ships underway on the high seas at night are required to display navigation lights to identify their
location and direction of movement to other ships. Most ships we required to display a set of four
running lights: one at the stern (rear), one in the middle on the mast, and two at the bow (front).

In naval practice, the course of a ship is the direction the ship is traveling as measured clockwise
from true north. For example, a ship that is traveling due east is on a 90o course; one traveling on a
315o course is traveling due west-northwest. The relative bearing from ship A to ship B is the measure
of the angle that the course of ship A makes with the vector drawn from A to B, where the initial side
of that angle is incident with the course vector and the terminal side is incident with the vector from
A to B. Thee measurement is taken clockwise.

If we assume that the bow of a ship is pointing to 0.0o or 360.0o, then the running lights have ranges
as shown in the figure. Here, the stern (rear) of the ship is at 180.0o. The masthead light shines all
directions (0.0o  360.0o). The stern light shines strictly between 110.0o and 250.0o (the angle at which
the stern light is beamed relative to the ship satisfies the inequalities 110.0o < angle < 250.0o). The
red running light shines strictly between 245.0o and 2.5o; the green running light shines strictly between
357.5o and 115.0o. (Note the overlap in the visible sectors between the red and green running lights
and stern light.) In addition, the nominal maximum light visibility range for all lights is 10 nautical
miles (nm).

For this problem, well suppose that the ship is a segment from prow (where red and green light are
placed at the same place, but red light is a bit to the starboard and green light is a bit to the port) to
stern (where the stern light is). The mast and the masthead light are at the middle of the ship.

Write a computer program that will repeatedly read in sets of data describing the location, course
and speed of your own ship and other ships in the vicinity. Based on this information, the program will
first calculate the relative bearings from other ships to your ship and display the expected configurations
of visible lights from left to right as viewed from your own ship. Ships separated more than 10 nm away
will not be visible.

The program then recalculates the relative bearings after a 3 minute time delay to determine which
ships are on a collision course with your own. If another ship is initially visible and if at the end of
the 3 minute delay the relative bearing from that ship to your own remains almost the same (within
2o) while the distance between the ships decreases, then the program must issue a collision warning.
Assume that there will be no collisions of any type (ship-to-ship or ship-to-land) in the 3 minute time
period.

## Input

```
The input file consists of several data scenarios. Each scenario is as follows.

Scenario ID (string  may contain blanks)
Number of other ships (integer).
name of your ship (string  may contain blanks). Information on your own ship on two lines.
x-coordinate y-coordinate course speed (reals)
name of other ship (string  may contain blanks). Other ship information on two lines per ship.
x-coordinate y-coordinate course speed (reals)

All coordinates are on a cartesian grid with unit measurement of 1 nautical mile. Courses are
measured from true north, and each course satisfies 0.0o  course < 360.0o. Speeds are in knots (1
knot = 1 nm/hr). The end of input is indicated by end-of-file.

```

## Output

```
Output consists of a single table per data set. A table shows the ID for each other ship along with
its initially calculated relative bearing to your own ship, distance from your own ship, and its light
configurations (from left to right) visible from your ship. If the lights are collinear with you print
them in alphabetical order. Collision warnings, if any, should appear at the bottom of the table. Each
warning should include the name of the other ship and its distance from your own ship at the end of
the 3 minute interval. (Do not display the relative bearings, distances, or running lights configurations
for the end of that warning interval.)

The output should be presented as on the sample output. The first and fourth columns are aligned
to the left. The second and the third columns are aligned to the right. All real output should be written
rounded with two digits to the right of the decimal (ie, 0.005 should be printed as 0.01). All printed
bearings should be in the range 0  bearing < 360. That means that 359.995 should be printed as 0.00
instead of 360.00. Use an accuracy of  = 107.

Print a line of 63 asterisks after each scenario.

Note: To help maintain floating point accuracy when converting degrees to radians, use the predeclared
constant pi.
