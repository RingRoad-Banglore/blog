title: Uva 12716  GCD XOR
---


## Input

```text

Given an integer N , find how many pairs (A,B) are there such that: gcd(A,B) = A xor B where
1  B  A  N .

Here gcd(A,B) means the greatest common divisor of the numbers A and B. And A xor B is the
value of the bitwise xor operation on the binary representation of A and B.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer T (T  10000) denoting the number of test cases. The
following T lines contain an integer N (1  N  30000000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number first in the format, Case X: (here, X is the serial of the
input) followed by a space and then the answer for that case. There is no new-line between cases.

Explanation

Sample 1: For N = 7, there are four valid pairs: (3, 2), (5, 4), (6, 4) and (7, 6).

```

## Sample Output

```text
2

7

20000000

```
