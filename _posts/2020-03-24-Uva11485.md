## Input

```

Given set S what is the value of the right hand side of the following assignment? In other words what
is the value of A.

A =

x1S


x2S


x3S


x4S


x5S


x6S


x7S


x8S

(
8

i=1

xi




8
i=1

xi
)

For example if S = {1.2, 3.6, 4.1} then the possible values for variable xi is 1.2, 3.6 or 4.1. The same
is true for variables xi, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8. Here x means the nearest smaller integer value of
x (floor function). For example 1.8 = 1, 2.0 = 2, 2.3 = 3
```

## Output

```
The input file contains 100 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:
The input for each set is contained in a single line. This line starts with an integer N (0 < N < 101)

which denotes how many numbers are in the set S. This integer is followed by N non-negative floating-
point numbers in the same line. To make things easy with floating-point numbers and to avoid precision
problems these numbers have only a single digit after the decimal point. Also the values of any of these
numbers are not greater than 1000.

Input is terminated by line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer which denotes the value
of A.

```

## Sample Output

```
1 11.4

4 537.0 365.1 870.2 841.7

2 216.5 4.8
