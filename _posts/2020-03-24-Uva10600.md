title: Uva 10600  ACM contest and Blackout
---


```
In order to prepare the The First National ACM School Contest (in 20??) the major of the city decided
to provide all the schools with a reliable source of power. (The major is really afraid of blackoutsJ).
So, in order to do that, power station Future and one school (doesnt matter which one) must be
connected; in addition, some schools must be connected as well.

You may assume that a school has a reliable source of power if its connected directly to Future,
or to any other school that has a reliable source of power. You are given the cost of connection between
some schools. The major has decided to pick out two the cheapest connection plans  the cost of the
connection is equal to the sum of the connections between the schools. Your task is to help the major
 find the cost of the two cheapest connection plans.

## Input

```
The Input starts with the number of test cases, T (1 < T < 15) on a line. Then T test cases follow. The
first line of every test case contains two numbers, which are separated by a space, N (3 < N < 100)
the number of schools in the city, and M the number of possible connections among them. Next M
lines contain three numbers Ai, Bi, Ci, where Ci is the cost of the connection (1 < Ci < 300) between
schools Ai and Bi. The schools are numbered with integers in the range 1 to N .

```

## Output

```
For every test case print only one line of output. This line should contain two numbers separated by a
single space  the cost of two the cheapest connection plans. Let S1 be the cheapest cost and S2 the
next cheapest cost. Its important, that S1 = S2 if and only if there are two cheapest plans, otherwise
S1 < S2. You can assume that it is always possible to find the costs S1 and S2.
