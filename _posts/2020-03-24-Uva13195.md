title: Uva 13195  Logical Equivalence
---


```
An ACM ICPC team wants to determine whether the two logical expressions are equivalent. Equivalent
means that their truth tables are the same. Can you help them?

Your task is to determine whether the two logical expressions are equivalent.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input data is the number of data inputs, N (N  1000). Then for the following N lines,
each line includes two expressions. The expression is composed of the 26 characters of a..z and the
operators of | & ^ ~ (). Where | & ^ ~ denote or, and, exclusive or and not respectively.
Priority from high to low are () ~ & ^ |. You need to ignore any other characters. There may be no
separation between the two expressions, and you need to judge their own separation.

Each expression has a maximum of 10 different variables (letters), an expression of no more than
100 operators, the length of the expression does not exceed 1000. Each line of input is guaranteed to
be uniquely separable into 2 syntactically valid expressions.

```

## Output

```
Output n lines, corresponding to each input, if the two expressions are equivalent, then the output
Yes, otherwise the output No.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
a ^b&(b|a)~b^ a
a^b&(b|a)(a^(b&(b|a)))
~~~~z~~z

```

## Sample Output

```
No
Yes
Yes
```
