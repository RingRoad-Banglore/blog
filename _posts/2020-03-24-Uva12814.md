title: Uva 12814  Greedys Pizza
---


## Input

```

Larry loves eating at Greedys when they cook their
Pepperoni pizzas, butas the name suggeststhe
restaurants owners are very greedy in their commer-
cial strategies and they only sell one kind of pizza ev-
ery day. Even worse, they never announce the flavour
they are currently cooking, so Larry orders his pizza
without knowing what will be its flavour until it ar-
rives.

Tired of this, he has collected some information
and this is what he got: if they cook a certain flavour
on day D of this week, theres a probability of 0.6
that the next week they will use that same flavour on
day D + 1, a probability of 0.4 for the day D + 2, and a probability of 0 for all the other days of next
week (incuding D). Saturdays pizza will be repeated on Sunday or Monday of next week, Sundays
flavour will repeat on Monday or Tuesday, and so on.

Given the selection of days when they cooked Pepperoni pizzas this week, output the probability
distribution for next week, to help Larry decide on which day he should go to eat at Greedys.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is a single line with 7 integers, one for each
day of the week (starting on Monday). If the number is 1, it indicates that Greedys cooked Pepperoni
pizzas that day, 0 otherwise.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a single line with the distribution of probabilities for next week, separating the
values with spaces. Answers with a relative or absolute error less than 104 will be considered correct.

## Sample Output

```
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
