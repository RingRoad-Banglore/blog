title: Uva 11529  Strange Tax Calculation

## Input

```text

The people living in large cities have to pay more tax than people living in rural areas. That is because
in cities people have many facilities, which rural people dont have. Also people in large and famous
cities tend to pay more tax than people living in smaller cities or towns. Government of Euphoria
now has a strange rule to decide tax rate  Tax rate of a house is proportional to the total number of
houses within 1 kilometer radius of it. The rule apparently seems ok, but as a result people have started
building houses 500 meters away from the main city and in this way they are enjoying all the facilities
but paying much less taxes. Also in this way the town has begun to expand very quickly, which is not
desirable.

So the government of Euphoria now decides to make a new tax rule which will be less (or not)
understood by common people and hence it will have less chance of being manipulated. In the new
rule, tax depends on the number of high rise buildings in the city and their orientation. Any three
high rise building makes Bermuda block in the city and the tax depends on average number of high rise
buildings per Bermuda block.

Figure 1: High-rise buildings of Euphoria

Figure 2: The black circles denote the locations of
high-rise buildings. Of the 10 Bermuda blocks
only 2 contains one high-rise building each. So
the average number of high-rise building per
Bermuda block is 2/10 = 0.2. This figure
corresponds to the first sample input.

As total number of buildings can be high so you have to help the Mayor of Euphoria to write an
efficient program that will help calculate tax.

## Output

```text
The input file contains several sets of inputs.

Each set starts with an integer N (0  N  1200), which denotes the total number of high rise
building in the city. Each of the next N lines contains two integers xi, yi (0  xi, yi  10000) which
actually denotes that the Cartesian coordinate of the i-th high-rise building is (xi, yi). You can assume
that the city is located on a flat land and it is so large that a point can actually be used to denote the
position of a high-rise building. You can also assume that no three buildings are on the same straight
line and no two buildings are at the same place either.

Input is terminated by a case where N = 0.

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by a
floating-point number. This floating-point number denotes the average number of high rise buildings
per Bermuda block. This floating-point number should be rounded to two digits after the floating-point.
Look at the output for sample input for details.
