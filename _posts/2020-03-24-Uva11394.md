title: Uva 11394  Digit Blocks
---


```
Often digit blocks are used to teach children formation of num-
bers. Block sets are available in the market which contains many
blocks, each of which has the shape of a digit. Small or large
numbers can be formed using them by placing them in a single
row. Given the information of the available digit blocks, your job
is to find out the total number of different hexadecimal numbers
divisible by 5 that can be formed using those blocks. To save you
from numbers with leading zeroes you can assume that none of
the blocks will have shape of zero. The available blocks may have
shapes of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E
or F which are actually digits of hexadecimal number system.
```

## Input

```
Input file contains at most 501 lines of inputs. Each line contains a string which contains only digits
of hexadecimal number system (but will not contain zero). These digits denote the blocks that are
available. For example if the string is A1BBB5, then you have two assume that total six blocks are
available. Of them three blocks have shape of B, one block has shape of A, another block has shape
of 1 and the last one has shape of 5. The string can be at most 16 characters long.

Input is terminated by a line containing a single #.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains a decimal integer number which
denotes the value N . Here N is the number of hexadecimal multiples of 5 that can be formed using
the given digits. Note that you can use some or all of the given digits to form number. You can safely
assume that N will fit in a 64 bit signed integer.
