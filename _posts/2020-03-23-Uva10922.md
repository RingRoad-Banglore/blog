10922 2 the 9s
A well-known trick to know if an integer N is a multiple of nine is to compute the sum S of its digits.
If S is a multiple of nine, then so is N . This is a recursive test, and the depth of the recursion needed
to obtain the answer on N is called the 9-degree of N .

Your job is, given a positive number N , determine if it is a multiple of nine and, if it is, its 9-degree.

## Input
The input is a file such that each line contains a positive number. A line containing the number 0 is
the end of the input. The given numbers can contain up to 1000 digits.

## Output
The output of the program shall indicate, for each input number, if it is a multiple of nine, and in case
it is, the value of its nine-degree. See the sample output for an example of the expected formatting of
the output.

## Sample Input
<p>999999999999999999999</p><p>9</p><p>9999999999999999999999999999998</p><p>0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>999999999999999999999 is a multiple of 9 and has 9-degree 3.</p><p>9 is a multiple of 9 and has 9-degree 1.</p><p>9999999999999999999999999999998 is not a multiple of 9.</p>
