< expression > := < component > | < component > + < expression >
< component > := < factor > | < factor > * < component >
< factor > := < positiveinteger > | (< expression >)

write a program which analyses expressions conforming to the rules of this grammar and evaluates
them, if the analysis has been successfully completed. It may be assumed that there is no overflow of
float(C)/real(Pascal) numbers range.

## Input
A integer n stating the number of expressions, then consecutive n lines, each containingan expression
given as a character string.

For each line value of the expression or output message ‘ERROR’ if the expression does not follow the
grammar.

<p>5</p><p>32</p><p>12+34</p><p>1*(2+3)+3</p><p>1(2+3)+3</p><p>qwe323</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>32</p><p>46</p><p>8</p><p>ERROR</p><p>ERROR</p>
