title: Uva 12663  High bridge, low bridge
---


## Input

```text

Q: There are one high bridge and one low bridge across the river. The river has flooded twice, why the
high bridge is flooded twice but the low bridge is flooded only once?
A: Because the lower bridge is so low that its still under water after the first flood is over.

If youre confused, heres how it happens:

 Suppose high bridge and low bridges heights are 2 and 5, respectively, and rivers initial water
level is 1.

 First flood: the water level is raised to 6 (Both bridges are flooded), and then back to 2 (high
bridge is not flooded anymore, but low bridge is still flooded).

 Second flood: the water level is raised to 8 (The high bridge is flooded again), and then back to
3.

Just a word game, right? The key is that if a bridge is still under water (i.e. the water level is no
less than the bridge height) after a flood, then next time it will not be considered flooded again.

Suppose the i-th flood raises the water level to ai and then back to bi. Given n bridges heights,
how many bridges are flooded at least k times? The initial water level is 1.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains at most 25 test cases. Each test case begins with 3 integers n, m, k in the first line
(1  n,m, k  105). The next line contains n integers hi, the heights of each bridge (2  hi  108).
Each of the next m lines contains two integers ai and bi (1  bi < ai  108, ai > bi1). The file size of
the whole input does not exceed 5MB.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the number of bridges that is flooded at least k times.

Explanation:
For the second sample, 5 bridges are flooded 1, 2, 3, 2, 0 times, respectively.
