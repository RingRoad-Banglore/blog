## Input

```

A college student Ji-Sung has a roommate, Young-Pyo, who
shares a room with him in the dormitory. Since they have
lived together for a long time, they also share household fa-
cilities, for example, a hair dryer, an electric iron, a battery
charger, etc. So the time periods when they want to use
one facility should not overlap.

Some day, Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo both have a sequence
of facilities Oi1 , Oi2 , . . . , Oin and Oj1 , Oj2 , . . . , Ojm , respec-
tively, which they want to use in this order. Here a facility
can be used more than once, that is, Oik = Oil , for some k, l.
It takes pi and qi time units that Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo
use the facility oi, respectively. The problem is to minimize
the finishing time by which they have used all facilities.

For example, Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo share household facilities O1, O2, O3 which they use during
1, 2, 1 and 2, 1, 3 time units, respectively. At some day, they use the facilities O1, O3, O1, O2 and
O1, O2, O1, O3 in order, respectively. Then the following figure represents the schedule which minimizes
the finishing time. The minimum finishing time is 8 in this example.

## Output

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given on the first line of the input. The first line of each test case contains an integer n ,
1  n  50, the number of facilities. The second and third line of each test case contain a sequence
of n integers between 1 and 100, where the i-th number, 1  i  n, represents the number of time
units during which Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo use the facility i, respectively. The fourth line of each test
case contains two integer numbers  and  , 1  ,   300 , the lengths of the sequences of facilities
which Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo will use at the day, respectively. The fifth and sixth line of each test
case contain a sequence of integers between 1 and n, representing a sequence of facilities which Ji-Sung
and Young-Pyo will use in order at the day, respectively.

## Sample Input

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. The line contains
the minimum time by which both Ji-Sung and Young-Pyo finish to use all the facilities.
