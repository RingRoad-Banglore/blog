title: Uva 11753  Creating Palindrome
---


## Input

```text
You are helping the problem setters of International Creating Palindrome Contest(ICPC) in problem
setting for the upcoming contest. In ICPC contestants are given some problems. Each problem is
an integer sequence. The goal of the contestants is to convert the sequence into a palindromic integer
sequence. A palindromic integer sequence is an integer sequence that is the same sequence when written
from forwards or backwards, i.e., of the form {a1, a2, a3, . . . , a3, a2, a1}. Some examples of palindromic
sequences are {78, 91, 78}, {100}, {10, 20, 20, 10}, {5, 5} etc. But {1, 2, 3, 1}, {10, 20} are not
palindromic sequence. You can convert {1, 2, 3, 1} to a palindromic sequence by inserting a 2 at 4-th
position which will become {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} and you can convert {10, 20} to palindromic sequence by
inserting 20 at first or inserting 10 at last.

As contestant will be given problems(Integer sequences) with different difficulties, problem setters
are asked to create problems of different difficulties. The difficulty of a problem is represented by an
integer, for example, 0, 1, 2, 3, , etc. The difficulty of a problem is D, if at least D insertions of integer
required to convert the given sequence into palindromic sequence.

Problem setters are also asked to give problems with difficulty not greater than K. Your job is to
determine the difficulty of a given sequence to help the problem setters. If the given sequence is already
a palindrome, it cannot be used in the contest. So you have to answer Too easy without quotes. If
the difficulty of the given sequence is more than K, that problem also cannot be used. In that case you
have to answer Too difficult without quotes. Otherwise you just have to answer the difficulty.
```

## Output

```text
Input will start with an integer T (1  T  100), number of test cases. Each test case starts with
two integers N (1  N  10000) and K (0  K  20), the length of integer sequence and maximum
allowed difficulty.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a single line of the form Case X: D. Here X is the case number. If the
given sequence is already a palindromic sequence D will be Too easy without quotes, if the difficulty
of the given sequence is greater than K, D will be Too difficult, other wise D will be the difficulty
of the given sequence. See the sample input and output for exact format.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4
4 2
10 20 30 10
4 2
10 20 30 40
4 3
10 20 30 40
3 0
10 20 10
