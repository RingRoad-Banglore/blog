title: Uva 13013  Just a bit sorted
---


## Input

```
Jurgen Guntherswarchzhaffenstrassen is known for his virtuous guitar playing and the cruel teaching
methods he employs with his students. What most people ignore about him is that he is also a fan of
numbers.

Lately Jurgen has been studying sorted lists, but he is getting bored. He thinks that such lists are
too predictable and not very abundant, so he decided to spice things up a bit.

Jurgen says that a list  of N not necessarily different positive integers is just a bit sorted if and
only if for each positive integer x > 1 that occurs in , the number x  1 appears at least once before
the last occurrence of x in . For example

 [2, 3, 1, 2] is just a bit sorted because a 1 appears before the last 2, and a 2 appears before the last
3;

 [2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4] is not just a bit sorted because every 1 appears after the last 2;

 [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3] is not just a bit sorted because no 2 appears before the last 3 (since 2 doesnt
appear at all in this list).

Jurgen is trying to find out how many different just a bit sorted lists of N positive integers not
greater than K exist. Two lists are different if and only if there is at least one position in which the
lists have distinct elements. Can you help Jurgen in counting the number of different lists?
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases; each test case is formatted as follows. The first line contains two
integers N and Q, representing respectively the number of elements in the just a bit sorted lists and the
number of queries to answer (1  N  5000 and 1  Q  1000). The second line contains Q integers
K1, K2, , KQ, indicating that the lists you must count in the i-th query cannot contain values greater
than Ki (1  Ki  109 for i = 1, 2, . . . , Q).

```

## Sample Input

```
Output a line with Q integers, such that the i-th integer represents the number of different just a bit
sorted lists of N positive integers not greater than Ki (for i = 1, 2, . . . , Q). Since this number can be
very large, output the remainder of dividing it by 109 + 7.

```

## Sample Output

```
1 1
1
3 4
2 2 1 10
1000 3
100 5 300

```
