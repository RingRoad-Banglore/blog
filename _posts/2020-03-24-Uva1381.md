title: Uva 01381  Balancing the Scale
---


## Input

```text

You are given a strange scale (see the figure on the
right), and you are wondering how to balance this
scale. After several attempts, you have discovered the
way to balance it  you need to put different numbers
on different squares while satisfying the following two
equations:

x1 4+x2 3+x3 2+x4 = x5+x6 2+x7 3+x8 4

y1  4+ y2  3+ y3  2+ y4 = y5+ y6  2+ y7  3+ y8  4

How many ways can you balance this strange scale
with the given numbers?
```

## Output

```text
There are multiple test cases in the input file.
Each test case consists of 16 distinct numbers in the range [1, 1024] on one separate line. You are

allowed to use each number only once.
A line with one single integer 0 indicates the end of input and should not be processed by your

program.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, if it is possible to balance the scale in question, output one number, the number of
different ways to balance this scale, in the format as indicated in the sample output. Rotations and
reversals of the same arrangement should be counted only once.

```

## Sample Output

```text
87 33 98 83 67 97 44 72 91 78 46 49 64 59 85 88
