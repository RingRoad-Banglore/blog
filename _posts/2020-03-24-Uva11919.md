## Input

```text
Its believed that frogs jump due to lack of natural physical de-
fense against predators. However, there are some types of frogs
that do not leap. In this problem, we will consider a hybrid ver-
sion of a frog that can both leap and walk.

Consider a magical creek with N stones. The shape of each
stone is either a circle or a square. Our frog is currently standing
on stone 1 and it is going to make (N  1) leaps so that it can
land on every stone. It is believed that after making N1 jumps,
the frog will grow wings and fly away. After every jump, it loses
10% ot its leaping energy. That means in the K-th leap it can
jump to a maximum distance of L  0.9k1, where L is the initial
maximum jump distance. The frog, however, can walk from any
point to any other point within a stone without loss of any energy.

In this problem, you have to find the minimum value of L that will enable the frog to visit all the
stones starting from stone 1. Obviously, the visiting order of the stones will be such that the value of
L is minimized. When calculating the distances, assume the frog is a point and the stones are circles
and squares on a 2D Cartesian coordinate.

## Output

```text
The first line of input is an integer T (T  200) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
starts with a line containing an integer N (2  N  15) that represents the number of stones. The
next N lines contain the descriptions of the stones starting from stone 1. Each stone will be given in
the format type X Y R. type can be C or S and represents circle and square respectively. If type is
equal to C, then (X,Y ) will give you the center of the circle and R will give you the radius. If type
is S, then (X,Y ) will give you the lower left corner of the square and R will give the length of the
sides. The sides of the squares are axis parallel. 0  X,Y  1000000, 0 < R  1000 and stones will be
non-overlapping.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output the minimum value of L. Errors less than 106 will be ignored.

Note:
For the second sample we have the picture below. Initial
value of L is 5.555556. First, the frog makes a leap to
stone 3. It loses 10% of energy and that means the next
leap distance can be at most 5.555556 * 0.9 = 5.000000.
Since the shortest distance between stone 3 and stone 2 is
5.000000, the next leap will enable the frog to land safely
on stone 2.
