title: Uva 01404  Prime ktuple
---


```

{p1, . . . , pk : p1 < p2 < . . . < pk} is called a prime k-tuple of distance s if p1, p2, . . . , pk are consecutive
prime numbers and pk  p1 = s. For example, with k = 4, s = 8, {11, 13, 17, 19} is a prime 4-tuple of
distance 8.

Given an interval [a, b], k, and s, your task is to write a program to find the number of prime
k-tuples of distance s in the interval [a, b].
```

## Input

```
The input file consists of several data sets. The first line of the input file contains the number of data
sets which is a positive integer and is not bigger than 20. The following lines describe the data sets.

For each data set, there is only one line containing 4 numbers, a, b, k and s (a, b < 2  109, k < 10,
s < 40).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write in one line the numbers of prime k-tuples of distance s.
