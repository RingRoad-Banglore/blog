## Input

```text
Every month King Arthur celebrates a High Council meeting. The K knights attending these meetings
are known as The Knights of the Round Table, probably because they sit at a huge round oak table
having K seats and a big throne with a sword and a stone carved in its back.

For todays meeting, each knight was given a number between 1 and K that indicates the seat he
must take during the meeting. Seats are numbered clockwise from 1 to K, seat numbered 1 being the
first to the left of the big throne. Obviously, the king himself was not given a number because he sits on
the throne. King Arthurs squire made sure that no two knights got the same number so there should
be no problems.

As usual, the king was the first to enter the council room today. According to the protocol rules, he
sat on his throne and prepared to receive the K knights that must enter and sit one by one. After the
first D knights arrived, the king noted that some of them could have sat on wrong seats, because they
were distracted talking about who would win the next tournament. What a mess! King Arthurs squire
promptly intervened and gave instructions to the remaining K D knights. Each of them must enter
the council room and try to sit on his rightful seat; if his seat is already occupied, the knight must walk
clockwise around the table and sit on the first unoccupied seat he finds. Thus, the final distribution of
knights around the table depends on the order in which they enter the room.

King Arthur is now interested in knowing the number of distinct distributions of the K knights
around the table given the seats occupied by the first D knights. Two distributions are considered
distinct if there is at least one knight who sits on different seats in both distributions.

As the Royal Advisor in Combinatorics and other Mathematics (or Royal ACM) the task is assigned
to you. You need to provide an answer within five hours at risk of loosing the kings favor. Hurry up!

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases; each test case is formatted as follows. The first line contains two
integers K (1  K  106) and D (1  D  105), representing respectively the number of knights and
the number of distracted knights. Each of the next D lines describes a different distracted knight with
two integers A and B (1  A,B  K), indicating that the knight who was assigned seat A actually sat
on seat B. It is granted that no two knights sat on the same seat.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input, output a line with an integer representing the number of distinct
distributions of the K knights around the table. This number can be rather large so output the
remainder of dividing it by 109 + 7.
