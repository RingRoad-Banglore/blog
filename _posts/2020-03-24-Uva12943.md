```
Reviewers of Electronic Designs  International Service (REDIS) is an organization that invests in
electronic designs. Some time ago, REDIS invented an electronic device, called Asynchronous Commu-
nication Internal Switch (ACIS), that is built connecting some components in series. In order to ensure
the proper function of ACIS, it is required that all components work correctly. For that purpose, inside
each component can be installed a fixed number of regulators, decreasing the probability of failure of
ACIS.

Components connected in series on ACIS.

For each component in ACIS, REDIS defines the maximum number of regulators that can be
installed inside it. Also, for each component and for each possible number of regulators that can
be installed inside that component, REDIS specifies the cost of installing that number of regulators
inside the component, and the probability of failure of the component if it were installed that number
of regulators inside it. For each component, it is guaranteed that the cost is strictly increasing on
the number of regulators, and that the probability of failure is strictly decreasing on the number of
regulators.

The Financial Manager of REDIS has hired you to design ACIS, minimizing its probability of failure.
Given a specific budget, you must decide how many regulators you should install inside each component,
in order to minimize the probability of failure of ACIS, ensuring that the total cost of your investment
does not exceed the given budget.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases, each one describing a distinct electronic device. The first line
of a test case contains two blank-separated integers N and K indicating, respectively, the number of
components connected on ACIS (1  N  8), and the budget you have to invest (0  K  1000).
The second line of a test case contains exactly N blank-separated integers M1,M2, . . . ,MN , where
Mi denotes the maximum number of regulators that can be installed inside the i-th component (1 
Mi  16), for each 1  i  N . Then N lines follow, each one describing a component: line i contains
exactly 3  Mi blank-separated integers i1, i1, i1, i2, i2, i2, . . . , iMi , iMi , iMi , where im is the
cost of installing m regulators inside the i-th component (1  im  1000, for each 1  m  Mi), and
im/im is the probability of failure of the i-th component if it were installed m regulators inside it
(0  im < im  100, for each 1  m  Mi).

You can assume, for each component i, that:

 The cost of installing regulators inside that component, is strictly increasing on the number of
regulators (i.e., 0 < i1 < i2 <    < iMi).

 The probability of failure of that component if it were installed regulators inside it, is strictly
decreasing on the number of regulators (i.e., 1 > i1/i1 > i2/i2 >    > iMi/iMi).

 The cost of installing 0 regulators inside that component is 0.

 The probability of failure of that component is 1 if it were installed 0 regulators inside it.

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line of the form a/b, where a, b are integers such that 0  a  b, b > 0,
gcd(a, b) = 1, and the fraction a/b is the minimum probability of failure of ACIS with the constraints
given. Note that, if such probability is 0, you must print 0/1.
