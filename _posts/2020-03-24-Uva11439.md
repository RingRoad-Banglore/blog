title: Uva 11439  Maximizing the ICPC
---


## Input

```text
You are organizing a wrestling tournament. The
tournament will be a playoff tournament, where 2N
wrestlers meet in N rounds. In each round, the re-
maining wrestlers are paired up and pitted against
each other. The winning wrestlers then proceed to
the next round, and the losing wrestlers are out of
the tournament. After the N -th round, one lucky
champion remains.

Exactly who meets who in each round is decided
randomly. Officially, that is. Unofficially, however,
your number one priority is of course to make all the
matches as entertaining as possible. You therefore
try to make sure that the matches are scheduled in
such a way that the least exciting match will be as
exciting as possible.

To be able to quantify this, you have assigned
an Index of Certainly Perceived Charm to each pair
of wrestlers. The higher the ICPC, the more excit-
ing you anticipate that a match between those two
wrestlers will be.

Write a program to determine the ICPC of the
least exciting match in the current round, provided
we schedule the round in such a way so as to make
this as large as possible.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains an integer T , giving the number of test cases. Each test case, giving a
round to be scheduled, begins with an integer 1  N  6, indicating that there are W = 2N wrestlers
in the round. Then follow W  1 lines of integers, the i:th of which contains W  i integers. The j-th
integer on the i-th line gives the ICPC of wrestlers i and i+ j. The ICPCs are integers between 1 and
109, inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line Case X: Y , where X is the number of the test case (starting from
1), and Y is the ICPC of the least exciting match, provided an optimal schedule is used.
