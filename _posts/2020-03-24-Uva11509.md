## Input

```text

TRobots Inc. fabricates and maintains touring robots. Every touring robot visits places in a Cartesian
plane scene to accomplish its tasks. A task of a robot is a sequence of at least two points the robot
must visit in a tour according to the following rules:

1. the robot starts at the first point of the task, facing the second one;

2. the robot moves in the direction it faces;

3. upon arrival to a point in the sequence, the robot turns counterclockwise an angle , satisfying
0   < 2, until it faces the next point in the sequence (convention: the first point in a sequence
is considered the following one for the last point in the sequence);

4. the robot ends at the first point of the sequence, facing the second one.

As a net result of a tour, a robot completes an integer number of turns. TRobots Inc. finds the
number of turns important as this number determines when a robot needs maintenance. Your job is to
help TRobots Inc. calculating the number of turns a robot completes for a given tour.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several cases, each one comprising a set of lines with data that defines a task for
a robot. A task for the robot is described by several input lines:

 the first line defines the size N of the task, an integer satisfying 1 < N < 1000 and representing
the number of places the robot must visit in the tour;

 each of the following N lines has a pair of integer values, representing the Cartesian coordinates
(x, y) of a point to visit in the tour (106  x, y  106). It is guaranteed that each pair of
consecutive points (considering the sequence as a circular list) are different.

The end of the input is given by N = 0.
