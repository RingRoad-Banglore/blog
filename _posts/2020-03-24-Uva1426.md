title: Uva 01426  Discrete Square Roots
---


## Input

```

A square root of a number x is a number r such that r2 = x. A discrete square root of a non-negative
integer x is a non-negative integer r such that r2  x mod N , 0  r < N , where N is a specific
positive integer and mod is the modulo operation.

It is well-known that any positive real number has exactly two square roots, but a non-negative
integer may have more than two discrete square roots. For example, for N = 12, 1 has four discrete
square roots 1, 5, 7 and 11.

Your task is to find all discrete square roots of a given non-negative integer x. To make it easier, a
known square root r of x is also given to you.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains exactly one line, which gives three
integers x, N and r. (1  x < N , 2  N < 1, 000, 000, 000, 1  r < N).

It is guaranteed that r is a discrete square root of x modulo N . The last test case is followed by a
line containing three zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a line containing the test case number (beginning with 1) followed by a list of
corresponding discrete square roots, in which all numbers are sorted increasingly.

```

## Sample Output

```
1 12 1

4 15 2

0 0 0
