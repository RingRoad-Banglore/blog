## Input

```text
Given a prime P , 2  P < 231, an integer B, 2  B < P , and
an integer N , 2  N < P , compute the discrete logarithm of N ,
base B, modulo P . That is, find an integer L such that

BL == N(mod P )
```

## Output

```text
Read several lines of input, each containing P , B, N separated
by a space.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line print the logarithm on a separate line. If there
are several, print the smallest; if there is none, print ``no
solution''.

Note: The solution to this problem requires a well known result
in number theory that is probably expected of you for Putnam
but not ACM competitions. It is Fermats theorem that states

BP1 == 1(mod P )

for any prime P and some other (fairly rare) numbers known as base-B pseudoprimes. A rarer
subset of the base-B pseudoprimes, known as Carmichael numbers, are pseudoprimes for every base
between 2 and P  1. A corollary to Fermats theorem is that for any m

Bm == BP1m(mod P )

```
