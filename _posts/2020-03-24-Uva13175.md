## Input

```text
China is the most populated country in the world and
has more than a fifth of the world population. In 1953
the first modern census was taken in the country, re-
vealing a population near 600 millions of inhabitants.
In the 60s the government started to promote the de-
lay of the age of marriage and also family planning
policies. In 1972 the first limitations on the number
of children per family were stablished; in the cities
they were limited to two. The one child policy was
implanted in 1979 in order to slow down the popula-
tion growth, which by that time had arleady reached 1000 million of inhabitants. This policy combined
the use of advertising, social pressure, a benefits program and even economic penalties. However, the
ethnic minorities were exempt and in the rural environments, families were allowed to have a second
child in case the first-born was a girl. In 2015 the one child policy was abolished and replaced by a
two-child policy.

A group of chinese demographers are studying genealogical trees of chinese families in which the
two child policy stablished in 1972 and recently recovered has been accomplished. In each family they
study the generationally complete subfamilies, i.e. those in which all their members have had exactly
two children. They want to know which is the generationally complete subfamily with most number of
generations.

As an example, in the following genealogical tree it is highlighted the generationally complete
subfamily with most number of generations, which are two in this case.

## Output

```text
The first line contains the number of proof cases appearing below. Each proof case is a sequence of
numbers 0, 1 or 2 indicating the number of children of the family members. First the number of the
genealogical trees root is shown and then the description of the subfamilies of its children appear,
which are described in the same way.

The genealogical trees never contain more than 5,000 members.
