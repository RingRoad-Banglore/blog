title: Uva 10255  The Knights Tour
---


```
The Knights Tour Happens on a (N N) Chess Board. There are two types of knights tour, Knights
Circuit Tour and Knights Path Tour. Knights Circuit Tour means that Knight will start from a
square, follow Knights movement rules and jump to another square and thus visit all the squares and
come back to its initial square without visiting any square twice. Knights path tour is very similar to
this; the only difference is that knight wont have to come back to its initial square. Below you can see
two types of knights tour in a (66) board. All the circuit tours are also path tours but not viceversa.

Given a board size N you will have to determine whether there exists a Knights Circuit Tour in
that Board. If there is a knight Circuit Tour you will have to print the knight Path Tour in that Board
from a given location. You can assume that there will be a possible Knight Path Tour from that given
position when there exists a knights circuit tour in that board.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains three integer N (1 < N  50), row
(1  row  N), col (1  col  N). Here N is the board length, row and col are the row and column
of the starting position. The row increases from top to bottom and column increases from left to right.

```

## Output

```
If there is no knights circuit tour possible for the (N N) board, print the line No Circuit Tour.,
otherwise print N lines each containing N numbers. The increasing numbers actually shows the order
of knights path tour. So the starting position will always have 1 and the last position will always have
(N  N). All the numbers will be printed right justified in a field width of five. A blank line should
separate the output for two consecutive sets. If there is more than one solution, any one of the solutions
will be enough.
