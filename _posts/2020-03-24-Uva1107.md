title: Uva 01107  Magic Sticks
---


```
Magic was accepted by all ancient peoples as a technique to compel the help of divine powers. In a
well-known story, one group of sorcerers threw their walking sticks on the floor where they magically
appeared to turn into live serpents. In opposition, another person threw his stick on the floor, where it
turned into a serpent which then consumed the sorcerers serpents!

The only magic required for this problem is its solution. You are given a magic stick that has several
straight segments, with joints between the segments that allow the stick to be folded. Depending on
the segment lengths and how they are folded, the segments of the stick can be arranged to produce a
number of polygons. You are to determine the maximum area that could be enclosed by the polygons
formed by folding the stick, using each segment in at most one polygon. Segments can touch only at
their endpoints. For example, the stick shown below on the left has five segments and four joints. It
can be folded to produce a polygon as shown on the right.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case describes a magic stick. The first line in each
test case contains an integer n (1  n  500) which indicates the number of the segments in the magic
stick. The next line contains n integers S1, S2, . . . , Sn (1  Si  1000) which indicate the lengths of the
segments in the order they appear in the stick.

The last test case is followed by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Output

```
For each case, display its case number followed by the maximum total enclosed area that can be obtained
by folding the magic stick at the given points. Answers within an absolute or relative error of 104 will
be accepted.

Follow the format of the sample output.
