title: Uva 11245  Anti Arithmetic Sequence
---


## Input

```
An anti-arithmetic sequence is one in which no subsequence of length p does form an arithmetic sequence.
An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members
of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 . . . is an arithmetic progression
with common difference 2. Now for a given p an infinite anti-arithmetic sequence is built in the following
way.

 The sequence will contain only positive numbers and strictly increasing.

 The first p1 numbers of the sequence is 1, 2, . . . , p1. After that each time the smallest number
is added to the sequence so that no subsequence of length p forms an arithmetic sequence. For
p = 3 the infinite sequence is 1, 2 , 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 28, 29 and so on.

Your task is to given p and n find the nth value of the anti-arithmetic sequence.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains an integer T (1  T  1000) which denotes the number of test
cases. Then each of the following T lines contains one test case. Each case contains 2 integers n
(1  n  2  1010) and p (3  p  30), and p is always a prime number.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output contains 1 number indicating the nth value of the anti arithmetic sequence
of p. This value will always fit into 64-bit signed integer.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
10 3
10 5
100 7

```
