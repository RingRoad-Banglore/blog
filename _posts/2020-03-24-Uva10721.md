Figure 1: Bar-code over 7
units with 4 bars

A bar-code symbol consists of alternating dark and light bars, starting
with a dark bar on the left. Each bar is a number of units wide. Figure
1 shows a bar-code symbol consisting of 4 bars that extend over 1+2+
3 + 1 = 7 units.

In general, the bar code BC(n, k,m) is the set of all symbols with k
bars that together extend over exactly n units, each bar being at most
m units wide. For instance, the symbol in Figure 1 belongs to BC(7,4,3)
but not to BC(7,4,2). Figure 2 shows all 16 symbols in BC(7,4,3). Each
1 represents a dark unit, each 0 a light unit.
