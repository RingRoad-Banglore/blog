title: Uva 12327  Xavier is Learning to Count
---


## Input

```
Xavier, a 9-year-old student, loves playing many kinds of puzzles. One of his favourites is the following:

Xerier, his classmate, has made many cards. She writes down a single positive number on each of
them. No numbers written on different cards are the same. After that she writes down an equation,
whose right side is a single positive number chosen by her, and the left side is the sum of p integers:

X1 +X2 +   +Xp = n

Then she asks Xavier put p cards on the corresponding Xis position to make this equation correct,
with an additional condition that Xi should be ordered from smaller to bigger, i.e.

Xi < Xi+1, i, 1 < p

Every time Xavier immediately comes up with many solutions. Now he wants to know how many
solutions in total are there for any n given by Xerier.
```

## Output

```
There are multiple test cases. The number of them is given in the beginning of the input. Then a series
of input block comes one by one.

For each test case:
The first line contains two space-separated integers m and p (1  p  5). The second line contains

m distinct positive integers  the numbers written on each of the cards. None of these integers exceeds
13000.

There are about 120 test cases in total, but 90% of them are relatively small. More precisely, all
numbers are less than or equal to 100 in 90% of the test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case:

For each positive integer, output the number of ways in a single line. To keep the output finite,
only numbers with positive ways should be outputted.

Output a blank line after each test case. See sample for more format details.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
3 3
1 2 3
5 4
1 3 5 6 7
10 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
