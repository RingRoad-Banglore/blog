## Input

```
There are N mines in an old battlefield. Each mine affects an axis-
parallel square area depending on its performance. Assume that
the location of the mine is the center of the square area. When a
mine explodes, all mines in the square area of the explosion will
explode as well. As a chain reaction, all the mines in the square
area of the following explosion will also explode. Assume that
when a mine is exploding, a mine on the edge of the exploding
square area will also explode.

In the figure on the right, if mine 4 initiates, mines 3 and 6
will explode. If mine 1 initiates, mine 4 will explode. The fol-
lowing explosion will result mines 3 and 6 to explode. Therefore,
initiating mines 1, 2, and 5 will cause all the mines to explode.

Given N mines with their explosion performance as square
areas in a two-dimensional plane, write a program that deter-
mines the minimum number of mines that needs to be initiated
to explode all given mines.
```

## Output

```
Your program is to read the input from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number
of test cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing an
integer N (3  N  2, 000), which represents the number of mines. In the following N lines, each line
contains three integers x, y and d, where x and y are the coordinates of the mine in the plane and d is
the size of one side of the square which representing the explosion performance (1  x, y  10, 000, 000,
1  d  1, 000, 000).

```

## Sample Input

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. Print the
minimum number of mines that needs to be initiated to explode all given mines.

The following shows sample input and output for two test cases.
