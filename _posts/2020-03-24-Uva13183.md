title: Uva 13183  Tobby and Array
---


## Input

```text
As it is known, Tobby loves arrays and queries (he also hates long statements :D). One day Tobby came
up with the following: there is an array of integers and multiple queries. For each query, Tobby wants
to know the value of the k-th position in the subarray [l, r] (r  l) (1  k  r  l + 1), if the subarray
[l, r] was sorted in non-decreasing order.
```

## Output

```text
The input has several test cases. The first line contains n (1  n  106) and q (1  q  106), the length
of the array and the number of queries respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (1  ai  109).
Then q lines follow, each line containing a query with three integers l, r and k (1  l, r  n).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query print the answer in a single line (Look at the samples).

Explanation: For the first sample.
indexes: 1 2 3 4
array = {1, 3, 4, 3}

For first query [1, 2] we have the subarray {1, 3}, after sorting we have {1, 3}, so the value in the
2-th position is 3.

For second query [2, 4] we have the subarray {3, 4, 3}, after sorting we have {3, 3, 4}, so the value
in the 1-th position is 3.

For third query [1, 4] we have the subarray {1, 3, 4, 3}, after sorting we have {1, 3, 3, 4}, so the value
in the 4-th position is 4.

```
