## Input

```text
A knight can move in any one of 8 directions (see diagram above on the right).

A knights tour is a succession of moves made by a knight that traverses

tour is one in which the knights last move in the tour places it a single move
away from where it started.

See example below (follow the numbers in increasing order to trace the
path).

In this problem you will count the number of closed knight tours.
