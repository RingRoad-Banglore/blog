title: Uva 01246  Find Terrorists
---


```

The Prime Minister and his Accumulated Council of Ministers (ACM) are trying hard to find all
possible terrorist locations. In his dream, the Prime Minister gets a message from God suggesting that
the answer to all terrorist problems are numbers (say one such number is X) such that the number of
factors of X (including 1 and X) is prime. These numbers supposedly contain the encrypted locations
of terrorists. Since the ACM has no programmer, the Prime Minister needs your help in finding out
such numbers.

Note: 1 is not considered a prime number.
```

```

## Output

```
