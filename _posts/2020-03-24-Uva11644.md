title: Uva 11644  Pyragrid
---


## Input

```text
The great innovators of the great pyramid have another great new idea. They are now planning to build
pyragrids  number of pyramid like stuffs assorted on a grid. What makes it even more interesting is
the item they are making the grid with  bamboo. They have a huge field that can be treated as a
2D Cartesian plane. Lets assume the lower left corner of the field has co-ordinate (100,100) while
the upper right corner is (100, 100). A number of bamboo sticks (You can safely assume that even
on that land of ideas, none has tried the weird idea of bending a bamboo stick. So, the sticks will be
always straight) are placed on this field. There are two mechanical restrictions which must be met while
placing bamboos. Firstly, the endpoint of a bamboo stick must be put on a grid point. Second, the
sticks must be either lie parallel or form a 45 degree angle with one of the axes. These sticks intersect at
different points and form a criss-crossed grid of irregular shaped cells. By the way, two bamboo sticks
can overlap i.e. one stick can be placed on top of another one. I forgot to tell you, these new pyargrids
have triangle shaped base, unlike the square shaped bases of the original pyramid. So, you can build a
pyragrid on a cell only if the cell has triangular shape. You need to determine the number of possible
cells on the grid where a pyragrid can be built.
```

## Output

```text
First line of each test case contains an integer N (1  N  100), the number of bamboo sticks. Each
of the next N lines has 4 integers, x1, y1, x2 & y2 (100  x1, y1, x2, y2  100), where (x1, y1) are the
co-ordinates of one end point of the bamboo stick while (x2, y2) are that of the other end. A stick will
have length greater than 0. The end of input will be denoted by a case with N = 0. This case should
not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For every test case except the last one, print one line of the form Case X: Y , where X is the serial of
output (starting from 1) and Y is the number of possible unique cells where a pyragrid can be placed.
