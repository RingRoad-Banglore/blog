title: Uva 13280  Substring  Sorting

## Input

```
You are given a string,  S (containing only lower-case letters). Next you are given some queries. The
queries  are  of  the  form:

 K M

This means that you need to find the M -th (1-based) substring from the list of sorted distinct
substrings of  S which has length exactly equal to  K . For example, say  S = abdcabdc and we are
processing the  query K = 4, M = 2,  that  means  we  are  looking  for  substrings  of  length 4  .  They  are:

1.   abdc

2.   bdca

3.   dcab

4.   cabd

5.   abdc

Since we are looking for distinct substrings, the second abdc will be ignored. Now if we sort them
the  substrings  will  look  like:

1.    abdc

2.   bdca

3.   cabd

4.   dcab

So for  M = 2 , the output would be bdca. However for  K = 4 and  M = 4 , the output would be
dcab. But you dont need to output the actual string. Rather just output the starting index (0-based)
of the output string. If there are multiple possible answer, then output the lowest one. So for  K = 4
and M = 1  (output string abdc), you can see that it can be found in two different starting indices, 0
and 4. As 0  is  lowest,  so  you  need  to  output  0.
```

## Output

```
First line will contain one integer, T (T  10) , number of test cases. Each case starts with a line
containing  S (1  |S|  100000) . Next line will contain  Q (1  Q  100000) , number of queries.
Each query  will  contain  two  integers  K  and  M  (1  K  |S|, 1  M   100000)   in  a  line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each query, output the starting index (0-based) of the desired substring. If there is no answer, then 
 output Not  found.  See  sample  for  clarification.
