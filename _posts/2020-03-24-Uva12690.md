title: Uva 12690  Counting Lattice Squares
---


## Input

```

A lattice square is a square whose
vertices are all lattice points. A
lattice-point is a point in Cartesian
coordinate system whose abscissa
and ordinate are integers. For ex-
ample (1, 5) is a lattice point but
(1, 1.5) is not. In a (n  m) grid
there can be many lattice squares.
In the figure on the left you can
see some lattice squares in a (44)
grid. Counting lattice squares with
axis-parallel sides (Figure 1, Figure
2 and Figure 3) is trivial but there
are lattice squares whose sides are
not axis parallel (Figure 4, Figure
5 and Figure 6) and counting them
is just a bit harder. Some of these squares can have even area (Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 6) and some
others can have odd area (Figure 1, Figure 3, Figure 5). Given an (m n) grid your job is to write a
program that counts how many different lattice squares with odd area can be drawn in that grid. Two
lattice squares are different if they do not share all four vertices.

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 50000 lines of inputs. Each line contains two integers m, n (1  m,n 
100000). Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer S, which denotes how
many different lattice squares with odd area can be drawn in an (m  n) grid. You can assume that
the value of S fits in a 64-bit signed integer.
