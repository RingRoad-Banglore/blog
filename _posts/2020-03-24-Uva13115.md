## Input

```
My friend Gerson loves to resolve sudokus. A sudoku is a numeric puzzle formed by a grid of n  n,
divided in n grids of


n 


n. Every row, column and grid must contain all the numbers from 1 to

n, without repeat. Gerson can resolve 20 sudokus per day, the problem is that 19 of them are wrong.
Can you make a program that given the solutions found by Gerson tell him if they are wrong or right?
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains a integer t, the number of test cases. Each case begins with an integer
n (1  n  25), it is guaranteed that n have an square root. This line is followed by n lines, each one
with n numbers mi,j separated by a blank space (1  mi,j  n, with 1  i, j  n).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case prints a single line with the word yes if the sudoku has been resolved correctly or
no otherwise.
