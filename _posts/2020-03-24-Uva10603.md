title: Uva 10603  Fill
---


```
There are three jugs with a volume of a, b and c liters. (a, b, and c are positive integers not greater
than 200). The first and the second jug are initially empty, while the third is completely filled with
water. It is allowed to pour water from one jug into another until either the first one is empty or the
second one is full. This operation can be performed zero, one or more times.

You are to write a program that computes the least total amount of water that needs to be poured;
so that at least one of the jugs contains exactly d liters of water (d is a positive integer not greater than
200). If it is not possible to measure d liters this way your program should find a smaller amount of
water d < d which is closest to d and for which d liters could be produced. When d is found, your
program should compute the least total amount of poured water needed to produce d liters in at least
one of the jugs.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains the number of test cases. In the next T lines, T test cases follow. Each
test case is given in one line of input containing four space separated integers  a, b, c and d.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of two integers separated by a single space. The first integer equals the least total
amount (the sum of all waters you pour from one jug to another) of poured water. The second integer
equals d, if d liters of water could be produced by such transformations, or equals the closest smaller
value d that your program has found.
