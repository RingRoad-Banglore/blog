Its my honest confession that I am not revolutionary
And I also regret that I am not a world beater
...
...
I am a point and you surround me like an ellipse
And no one else is there within

The above lines are taken from a super hit romantic song (A bit changed though) of Bangladesh.
The left column shows the lines from original song and the column on the right shows somewhat a
English translation of it. Arif is listening to this song after the end of his Casanova life. Last year we
posed a problem in Dhaka Regional on Mobile Casanova Arif.

After listening to this song about a hundred times (Roughly 7.5 hours continuously), a funny
geometric thought came to Arifs mind: if every boy was at the center of an ellipse and if only one girl
was placed in it for him, then he (Arif) would not have turned into Casanova. The girls of course cannot
go out of the ellipse, the ellipses cannot intersect and the poor boy stuck at the center. Maintaining
these constraints the ellipses should be as large as possible, so that the girls can gossip with one another,
standing on the edge of their respective ellipses.

You will be given the Cartesian coordinates of at most 15000 boys, and the eccentricity and orien-
tation of the ellipses. You will have to find the maximum possible area of the ellipses. All the ellipses
should have same and maximum possible area, same eccentricity and orientation.

Fig 1: Above you can see four ellipses are drawn
keeping four men at the center. In this orientation
these ellipses have the maximum possible area.

Fig 2: This figure shows an ellipse whose length
of major axis is 2a, length of minor axis is 2b, and
the major axis makes an angle theta with the

horizon. The eccentricity of the ellipse is

e =


a2b2
a2

. The center of an ellipse is the

intersection point of major axis and minor axis.

## Output

```text
The input file contains maximum 15 test cases. The description of each test case is given below:

First line of each test case contains one integer N (1 < N < 15001) and two floating-point numbers
e (0.2 < e  1) and  (90 < theta  90,  is in degree). Each of the next N lines contains two
floatingpoint numbers which denote the coordinate of a boy.

Input is terminated by a line where the values of N , e and  are zero.
