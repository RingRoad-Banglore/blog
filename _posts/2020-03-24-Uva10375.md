---


```
The binomial coefficient C(m,n) is defined as

C(m,n) =
m!

(m n)! n!

Given four natural numbers p, q, r, and s, compute the the result of dividing C(p, q) by C(r, s).
```

## Input

```
Input consists of a sequence of lines. Each line contains four non-negative integer numbers giving values
for p, q, r, and s, respectively, separated by a single space. All the numbers will be smaller than 10,000
with p  q and r  s.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input, print a single line containing a real number with 5 digits of precision in the frac-
tion, giving the number as described above. You may assume the result is not greater than 100,000,000.

```
