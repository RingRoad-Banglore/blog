title: Uva 00946  A Pile of Boxes
---


## Input

```text

You are making a pile of boxes. The boxes have cubic dimensions (equal edges) and their upper surfaces
are open, so a smaller box will fall into a larger one (container), but a larger box will stay on the smallest
top (Figure 1).

Figure 1 - Boxes falling over a pile

Furthermore, these boxes have strange properties: they are permeable to other smaller boxes, so
one box may fall through the interior of larger boxes until a smaller one or the floor is found (Figure
2).

Figure 2 - Boxes are permeable to smaller ones

There is one restriction: if one box does not fit entirely in the height of a potential container, then
it stays in the upper possible level (Figure 3).

Figure 3 - One box must fit entirely in its container

Given a sequence of boxes, it is necessary to evaluate the total pile height. All the cubes have
different dimensions.

## Output

```text
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive test cases are
separated by a single blank line.

The input is a sequence of text lines, as follows.
The first text line contains the number NC (integer format) of boxes. It is followed by a sequence

of NC text lines containing, each one, the length of a box (integer format). The maximum number of
boxes is 100.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output on a line by itself one integer number, representing the total pile height.
