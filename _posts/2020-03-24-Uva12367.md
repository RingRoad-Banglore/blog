title: Uva 12367  Binary Matrix
---


```
You are given an M  N binary matrix. By M 
N matrix we mean a matrix having M rows and N
columns and by binary matrix we mean each of the
M  N elements is a binary value, either 0 or 1.
In addition, this matrix wraps both in horizontally
and vertically. So i-th row is adjacent to (i + 1)-th
row for all 1  i < M and M -th row is adjacent to
1st row. Similarly, i-th column is adjacent to (i+1)-
th column for all 1  i < N and N -th column is
adjacent to 1st column. Obviously row a is adjacent
to row b implies that row b is adjacent to row a, and
same thing is true for columns. Now, two cells of this
matrix are adjacent if they are in the same row and
their columns are adjacent, or they are in the same
column and their rows are adjacent. So for a 3  5
matrix, cell (2, 3) has 4 adjacent cells (1, 3), (2, 2),
(2, 4), (3, 3) and cell (3, 5) has 4 adjacent cells (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 1), (1, 5). Note that, by cell (i, j) we
mean the cell of i-th row and j-th column.

You are only allowed to swap the values of any two adjacent cells of the matrix. Your task is to
transform the matrix in such a way so that, each of the rows has same number of 1s and each of the
columns has same number of 1s. If it is possible print both and also print the minimum number of
swaps required. If it is not possible try to make every row has equal number of 1s. If it is possible print
row and also print the minimum number of swaps required. If it is also not possible try to make every
column has equal number of 1s. If it is possible print column and also print the minimum number of
swaps required. If none of these possible you have to print impossible.
```

## Input

```
The input starts with an integer T (T  10), number of test cases.
Each case starts with two integers M and N (2  M,N  1000), number of rows and columns of

the matrix. Next M lines denotes M rows of the matrix. j-th character of the i-th line denotes the
value of cell (i, j) of the matrix.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output a single line. If task is impossible to complete, output Case #: impossible
otherwise print Case #: solution_type min_swap without quotes, here # will be replaced by the
case number, solution_type will be replaced by the type of solution found as described above it will
be one of these three both, row, column without quotes and min_swap will be replaced by the
minimum number of swaps required to complete the task. Please note that value of min_swap can be
zero.

See the sample input and output for exact format.

Explanation of sample input and output:
Case 1. The initial matrix is:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12367  Binary Matrix 2/2

001
111

If we swap values of cell (1, 1) and cell (2, 1), the matrix will become

101
011

Now each row has two 1s and we found the solution.

Case 2. The initial matrix is:

001
011
000

If we swap the values of cell (2, 1) and cell (2, 3) (Considering the matrix wraps), the matrix will
become

001
110
000

If we swap the values of cell (2, 1) and cell (3, 1), the matrix will become.

001
010
100

Now each row has one 1 and each column has one 1 and we got our solution.
