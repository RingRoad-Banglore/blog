12301 An Angular Puzzle
Here is an old interesting puzzle: In the picture below, what is the angle of DEA, in degrees? Note
that 5 angles are already given. The picture is drawn to scale.

You’re to solve a generalized problem: let a, b, c, d, e be the
angle of ACB, CAE, EAB, CBD, DBA (in degrees), what is the
angle of DEA, in degrees?

Note that E must be strictly on segment BC (cannot coincide
with B or C), and D must be strictly on segment AC (cannot co-
incide with A or C). The triangle ABC must be non-degenerated
(i.e. ABC cannot be collinear). Not all combination of parame-
ters a, b, c, d and e corresponds to a valid figure described above.
Your program should be able to detect this.

## Input
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each case contains 5 integers
a, b, c, d, e (0 < a, b, c, d, e < 90). The last test case is followed
by five zeros, which should not be processed.

## Output
For each test case, print the answer to two decimal places. If
there is more than one solution, print ‘Multiple solutions’.
If the input is incorrect (i.e. there is no valid picture for these
parameters), print ‘Impossible’ (without quotes).

## Sample Input
<p>20 10 70 20 60</p><p>30 5 70 15 60</p><p>60 30 30 30 30</p><p>30 40 40 40 40</p><p>0 0 0 0 0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>20.00</p><p>12.96</p><p>30.00</p><p>Impossible</p>
