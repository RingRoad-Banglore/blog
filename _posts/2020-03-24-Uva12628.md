title: Uva 12628  Two Triangles in 3D
---


```
There is a red triangle and a blue triangle in 3D space.

When looking from the top (from +z to XY
plane), how much red and how much blue would
be seen? (Assume you are seeing both the triangles
clearly from an infinite distance)

The triangles are opaque so they can block each
other.

For example, if the red one is (0,0,0), (3,0,0) and
(1,3,0), the blue one is (0,0,1), (3,0,1) and (1,3,1) (See
the figure on the right). When looking from the top,
both becomes (0,0), (3,0), (1,3), but you can only
see the blue one. This figure corresponds to the 3rd
sample input.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T
(1  T  3000).

Each test case contains two lines.
Each line contains 9 integers to describe a triangle:

x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3 (0  xi, yi, zi  100). The
first line describes the red one, and the second line
the blue one. Each triangle is guaranteed to have a
strictly positive area. They would never lie on the
same plane (As in that case you cant tell which one
blocks the other).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print two real numbers, the red area and the blue area that can be seen, rounded to
4 decimal places. Absolute errors less than 1.1  104 will definitely be ignored.

Explanation of sample:
In the first and third case, the red triangle is completely blocked by the blue one.
In the second case, two triangles intersect, each is divided into two parts.

```
