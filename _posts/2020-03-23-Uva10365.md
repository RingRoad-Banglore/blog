Donald wishes to send a gift to his new
nephew, Fooey. Donald is a bit of a tra-
ditionalist, so he has chosen to send a set
of N classic baby blocks. Each block is a
cube, 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch. Donald
wants to stack the blocks together into a
rectangular solid and wrap them all up
in brown paper for shipping. How much
brown paper does Donald need?
