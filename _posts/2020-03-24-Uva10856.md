---


```
Factorial numbers are expressible as the multiplication of zero or more prime factors. For example 4!
(Factorial of 4) can be expressed as follows:

4! = 2 2 2 3 (total number of prime factor is 4)

Given N , the number of prime factors in X! (Factorial of X), you have to find the minimum possible
value of X.
```

## Input

```
There may be at most 1000 test cases. Each test case consists of one non-negative integer N  10000001
in each line. A negative integer marks the end of input, which should not be processed by your program.

```

## Output

```
For every test case except last one print either Case #: X! if solution exist or Case #: Not
possible. if no solution exist in each line (without the quotes). Here # represents serial of test case
starting from 1. Look at sample output for details.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
240
241
-1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 4!
Case 2: 101!
Case 3: Not possible
