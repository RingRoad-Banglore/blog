title: Uva 12260  Free Goodies
---


## Input

```text
Petra and Jan have just received a box full of free goodies, and want to divide the goodies between
them. However, it is not easy to do this fairly, since they both value different goodies differently.

To divide the goodies, they have decided upon the following procedure: they choose goodies one by
one, in turn, until all the goodies are chosen. A coin is tossed to decide who gets to choose the first
goodie.

Petra and Jan have different strategies in deciding what to choose. When faced with a choice, Petra
always selects the goodie that is most valuable to her. In case of a tie, she is very considerate and picks
the one that is least valuable to Jan. (Since Petra and Jan are good friends, they know exactly how
much value the other places on each goodie.)

Jans strategy, however, consists of maximizing his own final value. He is also very considerate,
so if multiple choices lead to the same optimal result, he prefers Petra to have as much final value as
possible.

You are given the result of the initial coin toss. After Jan and Petra have finished dividing all the
goodies between themselves, what is the total value of the goodies each of them ends up with?
```

## Output

```text
On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:

 One line with an integer n (1  n  1000): the number of goodies.

 One line with a string, either Petra or Jan: the person that chooses first.

 n lines with two integers pi and ji (0  pi, ji  1000) each: the values that Petra and Jan assign
to the i-th goodie, respectively.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Per test case:

 One line with two integers: the value Petra gets and the value Jan gets. Both values must be
according to their own valuations.

```
