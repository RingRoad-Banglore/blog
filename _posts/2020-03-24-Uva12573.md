title: Uva 12573  Sohel Sirs Assignment
---


## Input

```text
Sohel sir gave an assignment in CSE-315 course instead of a class test. The assignment was to make
questions and provide corresponding answers from the chapters 2, 3, 4, 5. Each student is assigned
chapter no y according to the formula:

y = (Roll % 4) + 2

I.e. he has to make questions and answers from chapter y. According to this rule, Roll 4 was supposed
to make questions and answers from chapter 2 as (4 % 4) + 2 = 2 and Roll 35 was assigned to chapter 5
as (35 % 4) +2 = 5. In the meantime, roll 35 had already made the questions & answers from chapter 5
and Roll 4 got the complete assignment of roll 35. So to copy that assignment Roll 4 wanted to change
the divisor 4 of the formula to some number m such that his assignment changes to chapter 5 , that
is (4 % m) + 2 = 5. But he failed to find such number. Now, your problem is similar to the above
problem.

Given two number x and y you have to find a positive number m such that (x % m) + 2 = y. If
multiple m is possible, choose the minimum one. If no answer is found print Impossible.
```

## Output

```text
First line of input will contain the number of test cases, T  125. Then there follows T lines, each
containing two integers x (0  x  1012) and y (2  y  x+ 2).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print m, if m is found. Otherwise print Impossible (without quotes). See the samples
given below for exact formatting.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4
4 5
35 5
4 2
11 5

```
