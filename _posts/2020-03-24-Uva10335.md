title: Uva 10335  Ray Inside a Polygon
---


```
Suppose we have a convex polygon of n vertices. One of the edges have a light emitting point which
emits a ray of light in a known direction. The edges of the polygon are made of mirrors. As a result
when a ray falls upon an edge, it is reflected to another directon according to the laws of reflection. So
after a certain number of reflections we can evaluate the point hitted by the ray. Our challenge here is
to evaluate that point. By the way, if the ray falls upon a vertex of the polygon, it is lost forever.

The figure may not show the angles properly. But in actual cases, I mean in your program, you
should follow the rules of reflection.
```

## Input

```
The input session begins with two numbers 3  v  10, 0  n  1000, denoting the number of vertices
in the polygon and the number of reflections to simulate. After that a line will follow containing (x, y),
the position of the light emitting point, which will always lie upon an edge (and will never coincide with
any vertex) and 0  t < 360, the angle in degree between x-axis and the ray, measured in anti-clockwise
direction, which is always valid. Next there will be v lines each of which will contain a vertex of the
polygon ordered to the anti-clockwise direction. All points will be represented in x, y coordinate system
with two digits after the decimal point. A pair of zeros declares the end of the input session.

```

## Output

```
For every dataset, output the final point the ray hits after n reflections with two digits after the decimal
point. Remember, the point should lie upon an edge of the polygon. If the ray is lost forever within n
reflections, output lost forever.... Output for every dataset should start in a new line.

Be extra cautious about precision errors. Because if there is a vertex 4.00 and our ray passes through
4.001, we will count it as lost forever..., as we are concerned with only two digits after the decimal
point.
