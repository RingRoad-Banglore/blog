title: Uva 12653  Buses

## Input

```text

Programming competitions usually require infrastructure and organization on the part of those respon-
sible. A problem that frequently must be solved is regarding transportation. While participating in a
recent competition, Ricardinho watched the buses and micro-buses used in the transportation of com-
petitors, all lined up one behind the other as competitors disembarked. The vehicles were all from the
same company, although had different paintings. Ricardinho began to wonder how many ways that line
could be formed using buses and minibuse from that company.

Each bus is 10 meters long, each minibus is 5 meters long. Given the total length of a line of buses
and minibuses, and the number of different colors each buse or minibus may be painted, Ricardinho
wants to know in how many ways such a line can be formed.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed of a single line, containing three inte-
gers N , K and L, representing respectively the total length, in meters, of the line Ricky is considering,
K indicates the number of different colors for micro-buses, and L represents the number of different
colors for buses. Note that, as integers N , K and L may be very large, the use of 64 bits integers is
recommended.

```

## Sample Input

```text
As the number of different ways of forming the line can be very large, Ricardinho is interested in the
last 6 digits of that quantity. Thus, your for each test case your program must produce a single line
containing exactly 6 digits, corresponding to the last digits of the solution.

Restrictions
