## Input

```
Consider the set of all non-negative inte-
ger powers of 3.

S = {1, 3, 9, 27, 81, . . .}

Consider the sequence of all subsets
of S ordered by the value of the sum of
their elements. The question is simple:
find the set at the n-th position in the
sequence and print it in increasing order
of its elements.
```

## Output

```
Each line of input contains a number n,
which is a positive integer with no more
than 19 digits. The last line of input con-
tains 0 and it should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

For each line of input, output a single
line displaying the n-th set as described
above, in the format used in the sample
output.
