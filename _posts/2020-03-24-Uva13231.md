title: Uva 13231  Catch the Rats
---


```
Rats are loose upon the world, each at a 2D coordinate. Bob is going to release a number of devices to
catch the rates. If the device falls on the rat, the rat is caught. All rats on the segment between any
2 given devices is also considered caught. Finally, all rats that fall within the triangle formed by any 3
devices is considered caught. Calculate the minimum number of devices needed to catch all rats.
```

## Input

```
A number of of inputs ( 100) described as follows. The first two integers n and m (0 < n,m  300).

The next n lines are two integers x, y, representing the coordinates of a rat.
The next m lines is two integers x, y, that can be a coordinate of the device.
All coordinates fit into 32 bit unsigned integers.

```

## Output

```
For each input, output the minimum number of devices needed on a single line.

If it is not possible to cat all rats, output -1 on a single line.

```
