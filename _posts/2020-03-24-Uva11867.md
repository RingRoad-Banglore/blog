A number is called polite if it can be written as a sum of some consecutive positive integer. For example,
6 (1+2+3) is a polite number while 4 is not. Politeness of a number is the number of ways it can be
expressed as sum of consecutive positive integer. For example 6(1+2+3) is a politeness of 1 while
18(5+6+7 = 3+4+5+6) has a politeness of 2. Obviously, non polite number has a politeness of 0.

You are given a politeness P , you have to find out the smallest number that has the politeness P .
```

## Input

```

lines will contain a non negative integer number P (P < 1012) indicating the desired politeness.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input you have to produce one line of output that will contain number that has a
politeness of P . If there is more than one number having that politeness choose the smallest one. If

modulo 1000000007.
