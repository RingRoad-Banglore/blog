title: Uva 13172  The music teacher
---


```
In the last decades, rural areas have progressively lost more and more
inhabitants that have emigrated to big cities. That lowered the number
of children living in villages so much that made it economically impos-
sible to have a school in each of the villages and, even less, a specialised
teacher in each of them.

For that reason, a lot of teachers in rural areas have several villages
assigned and during the day they have to go and teach in all of them
to enlighten the minds of the kids.

The music teacher has been in this situation for years. Each year
he is assigned up to 6 different villages he has to visit compulsorily
everyday. Fortunately, he can design the timetables for his classes to
minimize the number of kilometers he travels.

After giving it a lot of thought and tired of spending hours and
hours in the road, he decided to start renting. Every year, after visiting
all the villages where he has to teach, he will decide where to live and
in what order to visit schools. But he has no idea how to make that
selection. Information about the roads is easy to obtain in the form
of tables of the segments of roads between the different villages and the distance between them. The
most difficult part is to find out what village minimizes the number of daily kilometers he has to travel.
Specially because under no circumstances he will choose to live in one of the villages where he teaches,
since he doesnt want to meet his students when he goes shopping.

## Input

```
Input is composed by several test cases, each of them representing the information of the roads of a
region and several years of the teachers life where the assigned villages change.

Each of the test cases starts with a line with two numbers, nv and nr, with the number of villages
of the region (2  nv  1,000) and the number of roads in the region (nr  10,000).

After that, there will be nr lines with the information about the roads, which are composed by two
numbers indicating the villages that are linked (between 1 and nv) and the kilometers that separate
them. Keep in mind that there could be roads sharing both origin and destination villages and that
there could even be rural roads that start and end in the same village (useful for farmers to go around
their lands).

Then, there will be a number c, indicating the number of different courses for which you will be
asked (at most 100). The following c lines will contain the information about the village assignation
from that course (between 1 and 6) and the identifiers from each village.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, you will write a line for each course taught in the region. Each of the lines will
contain two numbers: the identifier of the village where the teacher has to move to and the number of
kilometers travelled by car daily.

It is guaranteed that there will always be a solution. If there is more than one village that minimizes
the travelled distance, choose the village with the lowest identifier (those villages with lower identifier
have also lower rents).

After each test case, write a line with three dashes (---).
