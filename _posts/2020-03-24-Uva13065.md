## Input

```
If youre on a highway and Road Runner goes beep beep
just step aside or you might end up in a heap.
Road Runner, Road Runner runs on the road all day.
Even the Coyote cant make him change his ways.
 The Road Runner Show theme song 

The Road Runner (Accelleratii incredibus) is a very fast-running ground bird which can be found
in the roads of the hot and lonely Southwestern United States. Wile E. Coyote (Carnivorous vulgaris),
a clever canine, has repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to catch it using every kind of trap imaginable.

The Interstate is the Road Runners favourite road, since its a straight, L miles long path along
which it can run at constant speed without stopping or turning. One particular summer day, the Road
Runner is sunbathing on the Interstate and wants to run home (also on the Interstate) in exactly m
minutes, never exceeding v miles per minute. The Coyote meanwhile has installed bombs at certain
positions along the road and programmed them to go off at certain times in the hopes of catching the
Road Runner in one of the explosions.

Every minute, the Road Runner can move an integer amount of miles which must be less than or
equal to v, avoiding the spots in the road which have a bomb programmed to go off during that minute.
Given the positions of the bombs which will go off each minute, you must calculate the minimum amout
of miles the Road Runner must move to go from its sunbathing spot to its home in exactly m minutes,
avoiding all explosions.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each case begins with a line with a positive integer L which is
the length of the Interstate in miles (1  L  1000). Then follows a line with two integers xi and xf
which are, respectively, the initial position of the Road Runner and the location of its home (0  xi  L,
0  xf  L). The next line contains two integers m and v which represent, respectively, the amount
of minutes in which the Road Runner wants to reach its home and the maximum allowed velocity in
miles per minute (1  m  100, 1  v  L). Each one of the next m lines contains a string of L + 1
characters; character i of line j is X if there is a bomb at position i which will go off during the jth
minute, or . otherwise.

You may assume that no bomb will go off at position xi during the first minute. The end of the
input is given by L = 0, which should not be processed as a test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output a line with the minimum amount of miles the Road Runner must move to go
home in exactly m minutes and avoiding all explosions. If it is not possible for the Road Runner to go
home avoiding all explosions, then output -1.
