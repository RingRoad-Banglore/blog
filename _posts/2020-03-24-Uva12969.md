## Input

```
You are organizing a party and you want to invite as many friends as possible. However, some of your
friends hold grudges against other of your friends, and you dont want to invite two persons to the party
if any of them considers the other an enemy.

For example, if Alice hates Bob, Bob hates Alice and Carol, Carol hates Bob and Ed, Daniel does
not hate anyone, and Ed hates Carol, then you can invite Alice, Carol and Daniel at the same time,
but not Alice, Bob and Daniel.

Since you havent yet decided who to invite but need to know how much food to buy, you decide to
write a program to calculate the maximum number of friends that can be invited to the party.
```

## Output

```
The input format is as follows:

An integer in a single line which says the number of problems to solve. Then, for each problem:

 An integer in a single line indicating the number of friends (n). Then, for each friend i (starting
at 0):

 An integer indicating the number of enemies of this friend (e), followed by e integers (jk),
each one meaning that the friend number i considers the friend number jk an enemy. All
integers are separated by spaces.

n is less than 200 and e is less than 100.

```

## Sample Input
