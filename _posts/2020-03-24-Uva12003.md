title: Uva 12003  Array Transformer
---


## Input

```text
Write a program to transform an array A[1], A[2], . . . , A[n] according to m instructions. Each instruction
(L,R, v, p) means: First, calculate how many numbers from A[L] to A[R] (inclusive) are strictly less
than v, call this answer k. Then, change the value of A[p] to u  k/(R  L + 1), here we use integer
division (i.e. ignoring fractional part).
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains three integer n, m, u (1  n  300, 000, 1  m  50, 000, 1  u 
1, 000, 000, 000). Each of the next n lines contains an integer A[i] (1  A[i]  u). Each of the next
m lines contains an instruction consisting of four integers L, R, v, p (1  L  R  n, 1  v  u,
1  p  n).

```

## Sample Input

```text
Print n lines, one for each integer, the final array.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 1 11
