title: Uva 13111  The price is correct

## Input

```text
People use to say that developers are unsociable. To prove that this is not true (well, and for win some
money too) Douglas decided to go to the happiness contest in the television: The Price is Correct. The
rules of the contest are really easy:

Douglas has to stand on a grid initially off. When the game starts, different squares begin to turn
on and off. When a square is on, it shows a number in dollars. Douglas must run over all the grid,
standing on the lighted squares; for every square that Douglas reaches before it turns off, he will win
the amount of money that the square shows.

Every time that a square is turned on, last a second on and then off. However, its possible that in
the next second the square turns on again, with the same or other value. It is also possible that there
are several lighted squares at the same time, and of course Douglas will be able to stand just one at a
time.

Unfortunately, Douglas isnt free to run in any direction. Douglas will always begin in the middle
of a square and every step he takes will be only to the center of an adjacent square. Developers are
really fast to think but they are really slow to move so every step Douglas take will last one second.
This slowness will make Douglas lose a lot of prizes, so he wants to know what is the sequence of step
that he should take to ensure the largest amount of money. Given the initial position of Douglas, the
appearing time and the amount of money of each prize, can you answer Douglass question?

## Output

```text
Input begins with an integer t, the number of test cases. Each case begins with 3 integers N , M and
P (1  N,M  20, 1  P  500), that represents the number of rows, the number of columns and
the amount of prizes, following that there will be a line with two integers Xo and Yo (1  Xo  n,
1  Yo  m) Douglass initial position in the grid. After that there will be p lines with 4 integers: Xi,
Yi, Ti, Vi, (1  Xi  N , 1  Yi  M , 1  Ti  2P , 1  Vi  1000), the row and the column where
the prize is, the second that the prize will appear and the value in dollars for the i-th prize. There will
not be two prizes in the same square at the same time.
