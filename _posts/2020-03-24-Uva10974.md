## Input

Figure 1. A polygon cut into 4 pieces

Mohammad likes playing with scissors and pa-
pers. Recently, he has found a ridiculous geo-
metric game in one of the ancient books of the
Barareh city. He should start with a simple
polygon paper and cut it with scissors along a
specified direction. Finally, he should specify
the shape of the resulted pieces of papers. The
polygon shown in figure 1 is a polygon which is
cut into 4 pieces. But, Mohammad thinks that
this game is very ridiculous and boring, as af-
ter cutting the paper, you can see the resulted
pieces!!! Therefore, he decided to make it a lit-
tle bit amazing. Now, he wants to write a com-
puter program to find the shape of the resulted
pieces without actually cutting the paper.

After reading previous problems, you prob-
ably know that Mohammad is very lazy and he
needs your help to accomplish this task.

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The
first line of each test case contains a single in-
teger 3  n  1, 000, the number of vertices of polygon. Next n lines each contain two real numbers.
These numbers indicate the coordinates of vertices of the polygon in counter-clockwise order. The last
line of each test case contains four real numbers x1,y1,x2,y2 which indicate two distinct points of the
cutting line. The input will be terminated by a test case with n equal to 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, your program must output a line containing the phrase Test Case #k, in which k
shows the index of current test case, starting from 1. In next line, the program must output an integer
P , the number of resulted polygons after cutting. The next P lines each should describe the coordinates
of a resulting polygon with each two consecutive numbers separated by exactly one space character.
The vertices of each polygon should be printed in counter-clockwise order with the first vertex being the
vertex with the lowest and leftmost (among the vertices with the lowest) coordinates. Also considering
the output for each polygon as a sequence of floating-point numbers, the polygons should be output
lexicographically i.e. the polygon having a lexicographically smaller sequence of floating-point numbers
should be output first and so on. There should be a blank line between the outputs of two consecutive
test-cases.
For this problem please note that:

1. Two floating-point numbers are considered equal if their absolute difference is less than  = 108

2. Each number should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the fraction point.

3. The polygons appearing in the output should not have any 3 consecutive vertices that are colinear.
