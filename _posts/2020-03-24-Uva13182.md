## Input

```
Tobby, the small and cute dog, wants to prove to the rest of the world he is a descendent of Tutantobby,
the great dog pharaoh. As Tutantobby was mummified, his internal organs were dried and separated in
different bottles. To prove that Tobby is a descendent of Tutantobby, the DNA of some of these organs
must be extracted and compared against Tobbys DNA. This DNA comparison is not a problem for
nowadays science, but extracting the DNA from a 5000 years old mummified organ is a real challenge.

The DNA, as you might probably know, is represented as a sequence of letters A, G, C and T. All
Tobby can expect is to obtain fragments of Tutantobbys DNA corrupted by the years. Tobby requires
to assemble Tuntantobby DNA fragments, to do that Tobby takes two DNA fragments and computes
the best way to assemble them as in the following example. Lets say Tobby has the two following
Tutantobby DNA segments:

 GATTACCA

 TACAACAG

Note the following alignment and the resulting string:

GATTACCA
TACAACAG

____________
GATTACXACAG

The score of this alignment is 4, since there are 4 characters in this alignment that match. The
resulting assembled DNA would then be GATTACXACAG, note that the resulting string might have an
X letter representing that Tobby cant tell what that letter would be. Now Tobby wants a program that
given only two sequences, outputs the assembled DNA sequence for the alignment with the maximum
score. If there are two alignments that produce the same score output the one where the first string is
more to the left with respect to the second. For example if the first string is ATTG and the second is
GCCA, the alignment ATTGCCA is preferable over GCCATTG since both have a score of 1.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case contains two strings S1 and S2 that indicate
the two DNA fragments extracted from Tutantobby. These two strings will only contain the uppercase
letters A, G, T and C. After each test case there will be a blank line.

 1  |S1|, |S2|  105

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output two lines. The first one with the best alignment score, and on the second line
output the respective assembled sequence as explained in the problem statement. If the best score is 0,
print on the second line the string No matches. There should be a blank line after each test case.
