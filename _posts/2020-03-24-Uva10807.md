Xander: Calax Research and Development. Its
a computer research lab. Third largest employer

in Sunnydale till it closed down last year. What,
I cant have information sometimes?

Giles: Well, it-its just somewhat unprecedented.
Ashley Gable and Thomas A. Swyden,

Calax Research and Development is a large high tech corporation. They have an antitrust lawsuit
on their hands because they are too big. The judge has ordered that the corporation be split into two
new companies, A and B.

Calax has a large network of communication lines that connect a number of cities (each city is
connected to every other city by a path of communication lines). They now need to split those lines
into two sets, A and B. It is important that each of the two sets still connects all of the cities because
the two companies will not be allowed to share communication lines. It has also been decided that all
redundant lines will be sold off to protect the two new companies from more antitrust lawsuits. And
of course, the total cost of this operation needs to be as small as possible.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain a number of cases. Each case will begin with n  the number of cities (at most
10), followed by m  the number of communication lines (at most 25). The next m lines will contain
3 numbers each - the two cities connected by the line and the cost of keeping the line. Each city will
be identified by an integer in the range [1, n]. The cost of a line is at most 1000. The input will be
terminated by the case where n is zero.

```

## Output

```
Output one integer per test case on a line by itself  the minimum total cost of the communication
lines in sets A and B. Print No way! if there is no solution.

Comments
In the third test case, one possible solution is to let company A keep these communication lines:

1 2 10
1 3 10
1 4 10
1 5 20

and let company B keep these ones:

1 4 20
2 3 20
3 4 20
4 5 30

for a total cost of 50 + 90 = 140.
