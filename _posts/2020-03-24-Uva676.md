step

Maze search has been developed for a long time, and the related compe-
tition is held often. In this problem you have to design a program that
simulates a computer mouse to find a path in a maze from a starting
point to an ending point. To find such a path, the computer mouse must
follow the knight steps as shown in Fig. 1 ( represents the location
of computer mouse at present,  represents the step that computer
mouse can walk, and the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 indicate the sequence
of four directions the computer mouse has to try while searching for
a path). Specifically, the computer mouse must always try direction
1 first until it cannot continue searching the path to the ending point
in the maze. When that happens, the computer mouse can backtrack
and try direction 2. Similarly, if direction 2 can not work, direction 3
is tried and then direction 4.

Actually, our computer mouse is quite intelligent. Before it tries direction 1 it drops a stone. The
mouse wont go into a field with a stone on it (unless it is backtracking). But its not very clever, so
after trying direction 4 (before it backtracks) it removes the stone.

The size of given maze is 9 by 9, and its coordinates are shown in Fig. 2. Initially, you are given the
starting and ending points of a maze. Your program must print the walking path of the mouse if the
ending point of the maze can be reached and the number of steps is less than or equal to 50000. If the
number of steps is over 50000 print more than 50000 steps. Otherwise, fail should be printed.

## Input

```
The first line of the input is an integer N , then a blank line followed by N datasets. There is a blank
line between datasets.

Each dataset consists of the coordinate of the starting point followed by the coordinate of the ending
point in a maze.

```

## Output

```
For each dataset, output the coordinates of the walking path from the starting point to the ending
point or fail.

Print a blank line between datasets.
