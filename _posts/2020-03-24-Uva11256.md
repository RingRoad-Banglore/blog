title: Uva 11256  Repetitive Multiple
---


```
An integer is said to be repetitive if it can be written as a concatenation of several copies (at least two)
of another non-zero-leading integer. For example, 11, 123123, 454545 are all repetitive integers.

Since zero-leading integers are not allowed, 101 can not be considered as 0101. Therefore, 101 is
not repetitive.

Given a positive integer n, what is the smallest repetitive integer which is a multiple of n.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with an integer N ( 100) which indicates the number of test cases followed. Each
of the following test cases consists of a positive integer n, where n will be less than 109.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print out the smallest repetitive multiple of n in a single line.

```
