Shoulder-surfing is the behavior of intentionally and stealthily watching the screen of another persons
electronic device, such as laptop computer or mobile phone. Since mobile devices prevail, it is getting
serious to steal personal information by shoulder-surfing.

Suppose that we have a smart phone. If we touch the screen keyboard directly to enter the password,
this is very vulnerable since a shoulder-surfer easily knows what we have typed. So it is desirable to
conceal the input information to discourage shoulder-surfers around us. Let me explain one way to do
this.

You are given a 6 5 grid. Each column can be considered the visible part of a wheel. So you can
easily rotate each column wheel independently to make password characters visible. In this problem,
we assume that each wheel contains the 26 upper letters of English alphabet.

See the following Figure 1.

Figure 1. 6 5 window clips a valid grid representation for a password.

Assume that we have a length-5 password such as p1 p2 p3 p4 p5. In order to pass the authentication
procedure, we should construct a configuration of grid space where each pi appears in the i-th column
of the grid. In that situation we say that the user password is accepted.

Figure 2. A valid grid
representation for password

COMPU.

Let me start with one example. Suppose that our password was set
COMPU. If we construct the grid as shown in Figure 2 on next page,
then the authentication is successfully processed.

In this password system, the position of each password character in
each column is meaningless. If each of the 5 characters in p1 p2 p3 p4 p5
appears in the corresponding column, that can be considered the correct
password. So there are many grid configurations allowing one password.
Note that the sequence of letters on each wheel is randomly determined
for each trial and for each column. In practice, the user is able to rotate
each column and press Enter key, so a should-surfer cannot perceive
the password by observing the 6  5 grid since there are too many
password candidates. In this 6  5 grid space, maximally 65 = 7, 776
cases are possible. This is the basic idea of the proposed password
system against shoulder-surfers.

Unfortunately there is a problem. If a shoulder-surfer can observe more than two grid plate con-
figurations for a person, then the shoulder-surfer can reduce the searching space and guess the correct
password. Even though it is not easy to stealthily observe others more than once, this is one weakness
of implicit grid passwords.

Let me show one example with two observed configurations for a grid password. The user password
is COMPU, but DPMAG is also one candidate password derived from the following configuration.

Figure 3. Both of COMPU and DPMAG are feasible password .

You are given two configurations of grid password from a shoulder-surfer. Suppose that you have
succeeded to stealthily record snapshots of the target persons device (e.g. smart phone). Then your
next task is to reconstruct all possible passwords from these two snapshots. Since there are lots of
password candidates, you are asked for the k-th password among all candidates in lexicographical
order. In Figure 3, let us show the first 5 valid password. The first 5 valid passwords are ABGAG ,
ABGAS, ABGAU, ABGPG and ABGPS.

The number k is given in each test case differently. If there does not exist a k-th password since k
is larger than the number of all possible passwords, then you should print NO in the output.
```

## Input

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. The first line of each test case contains one integer, K,
the order of the password you should find. Note that 1  K  7, 777. Next the following 6 lines show
the 6 rows of the first grid and another 6 lines represent the 6 rows of the second grid.

```

## Output

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly the k-th password (including NO) in one
line for each test case.

The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.
