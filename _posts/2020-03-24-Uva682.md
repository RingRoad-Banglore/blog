## Input

```
Consider the following whoever-pick-the-last-one-lose game. The game is played on a 55 board.
Initially every array cell has a piece in it. Two players remove pieces alternatively from the board.
The player can remove any number of consecutive pieces in a row or column. For example, in the
configuration depicted below where one indicates a piece, the player can either remove one piece (A1,
A2, or B1), or remove two pieces (A1 and A2, or A1 and B1) simultaneously. The game ends when
one player is forced to take the last piece, and the other player wins the game.

1 2 3 4 5
A 1 1 0 0 0
B 1 0 0 0 0
C 0 0 0 0 0
D 0 0 0 0 0
E 0 0 0 0 0

Write a program that evaluates board configurations from this game. The program must output
winning when there exists a winning move that no matter how the opponent responds, it will force
the opponent to take the last piece. Otherwise, the program must output losing.

Note that during the game tree evaluation, if the current configuration has a winning move, then it
is not necessary to search any further because the configuration is guaranteed to be winning. This can
greatly reduce the game tree search time.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains 5c + 1 lines.

Line 1 c the number of configurations
Lines 2-6 ... configuration #1
... ...
Lines 5c 3 to 5c+ 1 ... configuration #c

```

## Sample Input

The output contains c lines.

Line 1 evaluation result of configuration #1
...
