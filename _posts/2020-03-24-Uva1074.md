## Input

```text
Rose N. Blatt is designing an embedded neural network to place inside a cell phone. When trained
by the phones owner, the neural network will enable the user to dictate text messages in a hands-free
way. The key idea in Roses design is the use of complicated polynomial response functions in each of
the nodes of the network (rather than the more traditional thresholding functions used in many other
neural nets). Figure 1 shows a portion of such a neural network (the polynomials are not accurately
graphed).

Figure 1

When Rose was ready to select her polynomials, she discovered a problem. Due to the limited
amount of memory available, she did not have enough space to store all of the coefficients of the
polynomials in her network. She has decided to use an approximation to each polynomial in the form
of a continuous polygonal curve with two segments, y = a1x+ a0 and y = b1x+ b0. The segments meet
at a point whose x-coordinate, c, is between -1 and +1. Rose wants the approximation to be the best
in the sense that the distance between p and the approximation function g is minimal. We define the
distance between p and g as the integral of the square of their difference:

d(p, g) =

 1
1

(p(x) g(x))2dx

Figure 2

For instance, if the polynomial is x20.2, then the best
polygonal approximation, with lines meeting at c = 0, is
shown in Figure 2 (the dotted line shows the graph of the
polygonal approximation).

g(x)

{
x 0.367, 1  x  0
x 0.367, 0  x  1

In the few bytes that are available for each node, Rose
can store the values of a1, a0, b1, b0, and c as signed num-
bers. Fortunately Rose has a program that supplies her
with a good guess for the value of c. Given this value, you
are asked to help Rose find the optimal values for a1, a0,
b1, and b0 in the approximations to her polynomials.

## Output

```text
The input file contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains
a positive integer n, 1  n  10, representing the degree of the polynomial p(x). This is followed by a
line containing n+1 numbers between -1 and 1 inclusive, which are the coefficients of p(x) from highest
order term down to the constant term, expressed with at most three places after the decimal point.
The last line for each test case contains the value for c, 1 < c < 1, expressed with at most three places
after the decimal point.

A line containing the integer zero follows the last test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number (beginning with 1) and the four optimal values, displaying
each with exactly three places after the decimal point. The first and second values are the parameters
a1 and a0 of the line segment y = a1x + a0 defining g in the range 1  x  c. The third and fourth
values are the parameters b1 and b0 of the line segment y = b1x+ b0 defining g in the range c  x  1.
The distance d(p, g) between p and g (as defined earlier) should be the minimum over all such choices
for a1, a0, b1, and b0.
