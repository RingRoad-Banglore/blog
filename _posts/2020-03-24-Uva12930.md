---


```
Given two floating-point numbers, determine whether the first one is bigger, smaller or the same as the
second one. Each floating point number is formatted as

[integer part].[fraction part]

For simplicity, both of the integer part and fraction part of the given floating point numbers will be
non-empty, and the integer part will not have leading zeros. However, fraction part can have trailing
zeros, so 0.0 is the same as 0.000.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each test case contains a single line with two floating-point numbers
formatted as above. Each number is a string with no more than 100 characters.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number, and one of Bigger, Smaller and Same.

```

## Sample Input

```
1.0 2.0
0.00001 0.00000
0.0 0.000

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: Smaller
