title: Uva 12413  Big Decimal Calculator
---


## Input

```
Languages like Java have Big Decimal libraries supporting basic arithmetic operations like additions,
subtractions, multiplications and divisions. However, scientific problems usually requires mathematical
functions like sin, cos, etc. In this problem, youre to write a Big Decimal Calculator.

There are 15 commands:

 Function with two arguments: add, sub, mul, div, pow, atan2

 Functions with only one argument: exp, ln, sqrt, asin, acos, atan, sin, cos, tan

For trigonometric functions, angles are always in radians.
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 100 lines. Each line begins with the function name, followed by arguments, then
the precision p (1  p  50). Each argument is formatted as one or more digits, followed by a dot .,
then by one or more digits. The integer part cannot be omitted, but the last two parts can be omitted
together. There can be an optional negative sign before an argument. Each input number contains
at most 20 digits. In function pow, exp, ln and sqrt, all the arguments are strictly positive; in
function asin and acos, the integer part of the arguments are always zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line, print the answer, rounded to p decimal places (Dont use scientific notation!). It is
guaranteed that the result will be a finite number, and its integer part will not exceed 10 digits.

Note:
You may notice that this problem is not language-neutral. I mean, some programming languages

have advantages over some others. This is intentional: real-world software development is like this.
Choosing programming languages, libraries and the overall architectures can be vital.

There are quite a lot of literatures on this topic (for example, Fast multiprecision evaluation of series
of rational numbers by Bruno Haible , Thomas Papanikolaou), but thats overkill for this problem. The
time limit for this problem is rather large, and the test cases are quite gentle: the goal of this problem
is to write a working program, not a perfect one, so try to write a concise code, which is usually faster
to write and easier to debug.

For a much more practical literature, look at this: http://www.tc.umn.edu/.ringx004/sidebar.html.
That small article presents how to translate arguments to make the series expansion converge faster.
Though you will not find the whole solution, youll have some nice ideas.
