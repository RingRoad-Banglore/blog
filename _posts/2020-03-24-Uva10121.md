## Input

```
Do you know Pokemon? Its a kind of a very lovely cute sprite. In the world of pokemon, people live
with their favorite pokemons and train them with love. One night, you saw a strange yet powerful
pokemon in a narrow dark cave. It must be the legendary pokemon. If only I could catch him! You
thought. Setting our your best pokemon, you decided to catch it - the legendary pokemon.

As a skilled pokemon trainer, you know that all you have to do is to battle with it and throw a
magic BALL to it during the battle. If youre lucky enough, the pokemon will be caught in the BALL,
and become yours. It sounds easy, but the balls can not always catch pokemons, especially fierce ones,
so you must be careful and follow a perfect strategy.

The battle is divided into rounds. In each round, your pokemon makes a move first, then does the
wild pokemon (you can choose not to do anything). Each round, a pokemon makes a move or uses an
item to attack its opponent or heal itself. You may also use a BALL to catch it in a round.

A move may be used as many times as you like, but can only be of the following three types:

1. Normal Attack The move attacks the opponent. As a result, the HP (lifevalue) of the opponent
will decrease.

2. Status change The move itself does not cause any damage, but you can make your opponent sleepy
or confused. if your opponents sleepy, he cannot make any move, if your opponent is confused,
he will attack himself sometimes. These will be effective within 3 rounds (that is, the victim will
be in the wrong status 3 times, and during that time, any Status-change type moves will not take
effect).

3. Poison attack This move attacks the opponent and makes him poisoned. If a pokemon is poisoned,
it will lose an additional poison value units of HP BEFORE he can make a move. The effect
lasts for 3 rounds (that is, the victim will be hurt by poison 3 times, during that time, any
poison-type attack will still do damage, but will take no OTHER effect)

The damage that the opponent will take after being attacked by a Normal Attack or Poison attack
is called damage value of the move; the probability that the move hits the target is called accuracy
of that move. If a pokemon is confused by a move, the probability that it CHOOSE to attack itself is
called confusion value of that move.

There is only one type of item available - Hyper Potion. It recovers a pokemon 200 HP .
A BALL could be of the following types:

1. Poke Ball - Used for catching pokemon. (BasicProbability=0.05)

2. Great Ball - Catches pokemon more easily than a pokeball. (BasicProbability=0.1)

3. Ultra Ball - Capture pokemon more easily than with the great ball. (BasicProbability=0.15)

4. Level Ball - If your pokemon is higher levels than the target pokemon then BasicProbabil-
ity=0.18, otherwise, it is the same as a Great Ball.

5. Love Ball - Captures pokemon of an opposite gender than yours easily (BasicProbability=0.20),
otherwise, BasicProbability=0.0

The probability that a BALL can catch a pokemon is computed this way:

P = BasicProbability + CriticalLifeBonus+ PoisonedBonus+ StatusBonus

CriticalLifeBonus = 0.05 if and only if 50 < the_targets_HP  100.
CriticalLifeBonus = 0.1 if and only if 0 < the_targets_HP  50.
PoisonedBonus = 0.1 if and only if the target is poisoned.
StatusBonus = 0.05 if and only if the target is in the wrong status (sleepy or confused).
All Bonus values are set to zero by default.
Initially, Both pockemons HP are full(HP values can never be greater than their maximal values)

and are in good health(not sleepy, confused or poisoned). Then, the battle starts. When one of the
pokemons HP is 0 or below 0, the battle ends immediately and the legendary pokemon goes away(you
failed). When you catch it, the battle also ends(congratulations!)

Since the pokemon is wild, it has not been trained mentally. So it follows a very simple strategy
during the battle:

1. In the ith round, he may decide to run away. The probability he makes this decision is run[i]%;
(he never fails to escape even if hes sleepy, confused or poisoned)

2. If he decided to continue the battle, he check if his HP . If its not greater than 150, he uses a
Hyper Potion if he has any(even if hes sleepy or confused), otherwise, he uses his only normal
attack move - Cross Chop. Its Accuracy is 30%, but the damage value is 300.

It is well known that the legendary pokemon is at level 50 and is male. His initial HP is always 999,
but people dont know how many Hyper Potions he has. People never saw him battle for 6 or more
rounds, so you may assume this is also true for your battle.
```

## Output

```
The input will contain no more than 20 test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing three
integers l, g and HP describing your pokemon. l is your pokemons level(1  l  100), g(0  g  1)
is its gender. 0=male, 1=female. HP is your initial(and maximal) HP value(1  HP  999). The
second line contains 5 integers. The i-th integer is the value of run[i], (i.e. run[i]% is the probability
that the wild pokemon flee in his ith move.) It is guaranteed that 0  run[i]  run[i + 1] for all
1  i  4, and that run[5] = 100. The next line contains two integers p1, p2(0  p1, p2  10). p1 is
the number of Hyper Potions that you have, p2 is that of the wild pokemons. The next line contains 5
integers b1, b2, b3, b4, b5(0  b1, b2, b3, b4, b5  5), the number of corresponding balls you have(i.e b1 for
Poke Ball...). The next line contains a single integer k(0  k  4), the number of moves your pokemon
masters. In the following k lines, each line begins with an integer t(1  t  3), representing the type of
the move. If t = 1, there are two integers following in the same line: damagevalue and accuracy  100;
if t = 2, there are two integers following in the same line: confusionvalue  100 and accuracy  100.
Note that the move makes the opponent sleepy if and only if confusionvalue = 0. If t = 3, there are
three integers following in the same line: damagevalue, poisonvalue and accuracy  100. All the values
defined in the three types will be between 0 and 999 (inclusive) while 0  accuracy, confusion  100.

The test case containing l = g = HP = 0 will terminate the input and should not be regarded as a
test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single line containing the probability that you catch the pokemon if you
follows a perfect strategy. Print your answer with four decimal places.
Note: You should follow this strategy:

- use move 2(poison attack) in round 1, then throw his ball in round 2.
- if this hits, the probability is (1-10%)*(0.2+0.1)=0.27, otherwise, probability=(1-10%)*0.2=0.18
- so the total probability=60% * 0.27 + 40% * 0.18 = 0.2340
(note that in some cases, the strategy is much more complex and may be dynamic  you may do

different things in different conditions)
