title: Uva 12632  Sum of Totatives
---


```
When Tomisus student Hedayet came to him with an open problem which he (Hedayet) thought was
true after running a lengthy simulation, Tomisus face lit up with a sense of glory. But soon his face
dimmed because he was able to prove it within one day and the proof was a mere four liner (Such an
easy and obvious proof will not bring glory). So now with a gloomy face he begins to write a contest
problem (What else can he do after all?) which came to his mind as a bi-product of proving that
theorem. Although as dumb as he is, he does not have any clue on how to solve this new problem, so
he plans to ask Snapdragon for help. But before that he needs to write a crystal clear statement :).
You may also help Tomisu solve this problem.

Let a  2 be a positive integer, (a) denotes the number of totatives of a, i.e. those positive
integers r < a such that r  a (in other word gcd(r, a) equals 1). For example (25) = 20. There is
another less known function titled sum of totatives which as the name indicates is the summation of
these totatives. The symbol for this function is 1. For example 1(25) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 +
9 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 250.

Now lets consider an equation 1(I) = M 1(J), here I = J and M is also a positive integer. Now
given the value of M , you will have to find a possible value for I, J such that 1(I) = M  1(J).
```

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 400 lines of inputs. Each line contains a single positive integer which
denotes the value of M . The value of M does not exceed 109. For at least 80% cases the value of M
does not even exceed 108. Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains three integers which denote the
value of M , I and J respectively. The value of M will be such that either there will be possible values
of I and J not exceeding 1016 or there will be no possible value of I and J . For the latter case print
the line No solution (without the quotes) instead the value of I and J , but you need to print the
value of M before that. You should make sure that (2  I, J  1016).
