## Input

```
... it is important to realize that any lock can be picked with a big enough hammer.

Sun System & Network Admin Manual

My appartment has n computers. My friends appartment also has n computers. In each appartment,
some pairs of computers are connected to each other with AcidNet cables (ignoring the routers). Each
connection has a certain bandwidth (in bytes per second). My friend always brags about the speed of
his computer network. He always shows me his n-by-n table that lists the bandwidths between each
pair of computers. My network is slower, and I want to rebuild it. So I want to know how I should
connect my computers in order to have the same n-by-n bandwidth table.

Since I dont want to buy too many AcidNet cables, youll need to find a solution with the minimum
number of connections. You may use AcidNet cables of any integer bandwidth  they all have the
same price at my local Imaginary Hardware Store.

Given a graph, you can compute the all-pairs maximum flow table, right? Now do the opposite:
given an n-by-n symmetric table, find a graph with fewest edges that has the given table of all-pairs
maximum flows.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one is a line containing
n (0 < n  200), followed by n lines with n integers each, giving the table T .

 T [u][u] will always be 0.

 T [u][v] will always be positive and equal to T [v][u].

 T [i][j]  10000

T [u][v] is the largest possible speed (in bytes per second) for sending information from computer u
to computer v, assuming there is no other traffic on the network.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by m  the number of cables I
have to buy. The next m lines will each contain 3 integers u, v and w meaning that I need to connect
computer u to computer v using an AcidNet cable of bandwidth w. Computers are numbered starting
at 0.

If there is no solution, print Impossible.
