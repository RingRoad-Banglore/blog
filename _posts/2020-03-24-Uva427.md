title: Uva 00427  FlatLand Piano Movers

## Input

```text
FlatLand Piano Movers, as part of their Total Quality Management project, has decided to focus on
the job estimation process. Part of this process involves walking the proposed paths that are to be used
to move a piano to see if it will fit through corridors and around corners. Now this is harder than it
might seem, since FlatLand is a 2-dimensional world.

FlatLand pianos are rectangles of various sizes. FlatLand building codes require all turns in corridors
to be right angle turns and prohibit T intersections. All dimensions are in furlongs. You can assume
that each portion of a corridor is long enough so that other corners or doors into rooms dont have any
effect on getting around a turn. You can also assume that the piano is narrower than the width of any
corridor. Note that the piano actually has to turn in the corner, since it can only be pushed or pulled
on one of its shorter sides (there are no square pianos).

Your teams job is to write a program for a palmtop computer that will determine if a given piano
will fit around a corner in a corridor.

## Output

```text
The input consists of a series of lines up to 80 columns in width followed by the end-of-file. Each line
consists of a series of number pairs. The numbers of a pair are separated by a comma and the pairs are
separated by at least one space. The first pair is the size of a piano, and the remaining pairs are the
widths of corridors on each side of the turns. Consider the example:

600,200 300,500 837,500 350,350

This is a 600 by 200 piano. The first turn is from a 300 furlong wide corridor through a right angle
turn into a 500 furlong wide corridor. The next turn is from an 837 furlong wide corridor into one 500
furlongs wide. The last turn is from a 350 furlong wide corridor into another 350 furlong wide corridor.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each piano, your program is to produce a yes-or-no answer for each turn. If the piano will fit around
the turn, print Y; if not, print N. The results for each piano should be printed on a separate line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
600,200 300,500 837,500 350,350
137,1200 600,500 600,400

```
