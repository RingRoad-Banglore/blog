title: Uva 00675  Convex Hull of the Polygon
---


## Input

```text
Suppose that a polygon is represented by a set of integer coordinates,

{(x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn), (x0, y0)}.

Please find the convex hull of the polygon, where a convex hull is the minimum bounding convex
polygon and convex means the angle between two consecutive edges is less than 180o.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several datasets separated by a blank line.

Each dataset contains a sequence of integer coordinates xi, yi, one in each line. All input sequence
will contain at least 3 different points.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output for each dataset should contain a sequence of integer coordinates xi, yi, specifying the
convex hull, each in a line. The first coordinate of the output sequence must be the first coordinate in
the input sequence that belongs to the convex hull. The output sequence must be in counter-cockwise
order.

Print a blank line between datasets.

## Sample Output

```text
0, 0
2, 0
1, 1
2, 2
0, 2
0, 0
