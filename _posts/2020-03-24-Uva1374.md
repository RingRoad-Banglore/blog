## Input

```text

Starting with x and repeatedly multiplying by x, we can compute x31 with thirty multiplications:

x2 = x x, x3 = x2  x, x4 = x3  x, . . . , x31 = x30  x.

The operation of squaring can appreciably shorten the sequence of multiplications. The following is a
way to compute x31 with eight multiplications:

x2 = x x, x3 = x2  x, x6 = x3  x3, x7 = x6  x, x14 = x7  x7,
x15 = x14  x, x30 = x15  x15, x31 = x30  x.

This is not the shortest sequence of multiplications to compute x31. There are many ways with only
seven multiplications. The following is one of them:

x2 = x x, x4 = x2  x2, x8 = x4  x4, x10 = x8  x2,
x20 = x10  x10, x30 = x20  x10, x31 = x30  x.

There however is no way to compute x31 with fewer multiplications. Thus this is one of the most
efficient ways to compute x31 only by multiplications.

If division is also available, we can find a shorter sequence of operations. It is possible to compute x31

with six operations (five multiplications and one division):

x2 = xx, x4 = x2x2, x8 = x4x4, x16 = x8x8, x32 = x16x16, x31 = x32x.

This is one of the most efficient ways to compute x31 if a division is as fast as a multiplication.
Your mission is to write a program to find the least number of operations to compute xn by multipli-

cation and division starting with x for the given positive integer n. Products and quotients appearing in
the sequence of operations should be x to a positive integers power. In other words, x3, for example,
should never appear.

## Output

```text
The input is a sequence of one or more lines each containing a single integer n. n is positive and less
than or equal to 1000. The end of the input is indicated by a zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Your program should print the least total number of multiplications and divisions required to compute
xn starting with x for the integer n. The numbers should be written each in a separate line without
any superfluous characters such as leading or trailing spaces.
