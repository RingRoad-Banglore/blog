title: Uva 12006  Paint Brush
---


```
Jim just had a party in his home and thats why he painted some non overlapping beautiful circles in
his floor. But after the party, Jim wants to repaint the floor, mostly the portions where the circles were
drawn. As you know that painting for a party is exciting, but the repainting after the party is definitely
boring; he bought an automatic Paint Brush from the departmental store for this task.

The Paint Brush is a square shaped electronic brush and the
size of its one side is k. It considers the room as a 2D plane.
Initially its placed in the room. When turned on, it follows some
pre-written moves that are programmed into its memory. And
in each move, it moves k units North, South, West or East. The
brush starts painting right after being turned on and continues
painting until it stops. And it stops after finishing all the moves.
The moves are programmed in such a way that it never paints
the same part it has painted already.

Now you are given the co-ordinates and radiuses of the circles
and the lower left co-ordinates of the brush, its prewritten moves
and k, you have to find the total percentage of the area of the
circles that are repainted by the brush. All the co-ordinates are
given according to the view of the brush.

For example, in the above picture, the brush is initially placed
on (1, 5) (red) and k is 4. One circle (green) was drawn whose
center is on (10, 9) and radius is 3. And the instructions for the brush are (east 2, south 1). It means
that it has 2 moves in east and 1 move in south. After 1 move in east it goes to (5, 5) (yellow). After
2-nd move to east it goes to (9, 5) (blue). And after 1 move to south it goes to (9, 1) (black).

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 4000), denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case starts with a line containing five integers n (1  n  16), Bx, By, k (1  k  20),
and m (0  m  20000) where n denotes the number of non-overlapping circles, (Bx, By) denotes the
lower-left corner of the initial position of the brush and m denotes the number of instructions. Each
of the next n lines contains 3 integers xi, yi, ri (0 < ri  20000), where (xi, yi) denotes the center of
the i-th circle and ri denotes the radius. Each of the next m lines will contain an instruction which is
denoted by a string which shows the direction and is one of north, south, east, west and an
integer p (1  p  20000) denoting the number of moves in this direction. |Bx|, |By|, |xi|, |yi|  20000
and the instructions are given such that it never paints any part more than once.

You can assume that the total number of lines in the input file is less than 100000.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the case number and percentage of the area of the circles that are repainted by the
Paint Brush. Print the percentage with at least 6 digits after the decimal point. Errors less than 105
will be ignored. See the samples for more details.
