title: Uva 11527  Morning Walk!
---


## Input

```text

Many people walks in the morning to keep fit. But morning walks can be strange for people who knows
mathematics pretty well. That is what has happened to Peter who loves mathematics and loves to walk
in the morning.

Peter starts walking from a fixed point M. He walks s1 steps towards a certain direction, turns left
or right and then walks s2 steps to reach another place N. At N he turns left or right and walks s3 steps
in a straight line and then turns left or right and walks s4 steps in that direction and reaches another
place P. At P he turns left or right walks s5 steps in the same direction and then turns left or right and
then he again walks s6 steps to reach point M from where he started walking. The next morning Peter
decides to walks less, so from M he walks at the direction of N and after exactly s7 steps he reaches N.
From N he walks towards the direction P and after s8 steps he reaches point P and from P he walks
towards point M. After walking exactly s9 steps he reaches point M again.

But after walking he becomes very exhausted and forgets his walking directions or the location of N
and Q. He only remembers that he has walked total S steps on the second morning. For simplification
you can assume the following things:

(a) At each step Peter covers exactly the same distance.

(b) If peter turns left or right is walking direction changes exactly 90 degree.

(c) While turning only the direction of Peter changes, his position remains the same. Turning left or
right is not considered as a step.

(d) For the first morning assume that s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6  0. Also assume that M, N and P are
three different point and not collinear.

Given the value of S, your job is to find possible values of s7, s8 and s9.

## Output

```text
Input file contains at most 300 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer S (0 < S  60000). Input
is terminated by a line containing a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce two or more line of output. The first line should contain the serial of
output. The next lines should contain possible values of s7, s8 and s9. Please note than you should
print only those solutions where s7  s8  s9. If there is more than one solution then print them in the
ascending order of s7. If there is still a tie then print in the ascending order of s8. If no valid values of
s7, s8 and s9 is found print the line Peter has Forgotten Everything instead. Look at the output
for sample input for details.
