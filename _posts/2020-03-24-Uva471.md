```
The input file consist a integer at the beginning indicating the number of test case followed by a blank
line. Each test case consists of one line of input containing N .

Two input are separated by a blank line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input the output consists of a sequence of zero or more lines each containing  s1 / s2 = N ,
where s1, s2 and N  are the integers described above. When there are two or more solutions, sort them
by increasing numerator values.

Two consecutive output set will separated by a blank line.
