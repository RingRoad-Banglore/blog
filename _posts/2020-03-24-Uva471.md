```
Write a program that finds and displays all pairs of integers s1 and s2 such that:

1. neither s1 nor s2 have any digits repeated; and

2. s1/s2 = N , where N is a given integer;
```

## Input

```
The input file consist a integer at the beginning indicating the number of test case followed by a blank
line. Each test case consists of one line of input containing N .

Two input are separated by a blank line.

```

## Output

```
For each input the output consists of a sequence of zero or more lines each containing  s1 / s2 = N ,
where s1, s2 and N  are the integers described above. When there are two or more solutions, sort them
by increasing numerator values.

Two consecutive output set will separated by a blank line.

```

## Sample Input

```
1

1234567890

```

## Sample Output

```
1234567890 / 1 = 1234567890
2469135780 / 2 = 1234567890
4938271560 / 4 = 1234567890
6172839450 / 5 = 1234567890
8641975230 / 7 = 1234567890
9876543120 / 8 = 1234567890
```
