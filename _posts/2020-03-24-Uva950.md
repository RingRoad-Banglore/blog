I know what youre thinking about, said Tweedledum; but it isnt
so, nohow.

Contrariwise, continued Tweedledee, if it was so, it might be;
and if it were so, it would be; but as it isnt, it aint. Thats logic.

Im sorry, could you help me out of this wood: its getting dark!
you said.

Youve begun wrong! cried Tweedledum. The first thing in a
visit is to say How dye do? and shake hands!

And here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they
held out the two hands that were free, to shake hands with you.

We are now discussing the possibility of teaching Tweedle Numbers to everyone on the kingdom!
shouted Tweedledee.

No, no, could you please just tell me the way out? you cried. But they were already explaining
how Tweedle numbers worked. . .

Its easy, you see, since if it werent so, it wouldnt be. Thats logic! both of them said.
And we only have a few rules they said, starting to write on a board:

 All tweedle numbers are binary numbers (a sequence of zeros and ones), and always start with a
1 (one);

 They have exactly N digits;

 Each subsequence of consecutive and equal digits (lets call it a run) only has at maximum M
digits

 There exist exactly K runs

Nohow. And thank you very much for asking about our numbers!, said Tweedledum.
But I did not ask. . . you said. Too late! You like math? Funny! Ill give you examples added

Tweedledee.
If N = 6, K = 3 and M = 3 he said with a great smile then we have this Tweedle numbers!.

# Tweedle Nr # Tweedle Nr

1 100011 5 110111

2 100111 6 111001

3 110001 7 111011

4 110011

Ditto, we can assign a single number for each Tweedle number, its id, if we see them in ascending
order! said Tweedledum.

Ditto, ditto! cried Tweedledee. Why are you telling him that? He is not real! shouted Twee-
dledee.

I am real! you responded in tears. . .
I hope you dont suppose those are real tears? Tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt.

Well, well, I can discover the id of a Tweedle number faster than you Tweedledee said.
Nohow! Im very fast, generally, Tweedledum said on a low voice: only today I happen to have

a headache.
And Ive got a toothache! said Tweedledee, who had overheard the remark. Far worse than you,

but Im still faster.
And you, how fast you are, you imaginary being? they both said.

And you had no solution but to make a program to discover that... So many strange things happen
in Wonderland!

Given a specific N , K and M , and a list of valid Tweedle Numbers, your task is to discover the
number id that represent each number, this is, the position in which it appears if we take all the valid
Tweedle Numbers for that parameters and sort them in ascending order of their binary representation.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive
test cases are separated by a single blank line.

The first line will contain exactly three integers: the parameters N , K and M , given exactly in that
order. (1  N,M,K  33).

Then comes a line with a single integer T , saying how many Tweedle Numbers follow (1  T  20).
Then there will be exactly T lines, each one containing a single Tweedle Number, represented as a
sequence of zero or one digits. The numbers are valid in what respects to the parameters N ,M and K.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

You must output a single line for each Tweedle Number, giving its number id. See the sample input
and output, combined with the figure 1, to better understand what you need to do.
