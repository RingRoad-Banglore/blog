title: Uva 11909  Soya Milk
---


```
On the dining table we have a packet of soya milk. We can look
at the packet as a rectangular box with height h, length l and
width w. We tilt it against a base edge, as shown in the picture.
Soya milk then comes out through the opening in the top face.
This process stops when the milk level is no longer higher than
the opening.

Write a program that computes the volume of soya milk re-
maining in the packet.

Note that the problem description may not perfectly match
the real-life situation, but to solve this problem you must follow our assumptions.
```

## Input

```
Each input file contains multiple test cases, and each test
case starts on a new line.

Each case consists of four positive integers l, w, h (in
centimetres) and  (in degrees), all strictly less than 90.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line containing the volume of
soya milk inside the packet in millilitres, correct to 3 deci-
mal places.

```

## Sample Input

```
9 6 19 20

```

## Sample Output

```
937.555 mL
```
