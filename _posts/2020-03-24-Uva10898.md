title: Uva 10898  Combo Deal
---


## Input

```text
A fast food store offers a series of combo meal deals in addition to individually priced items. For
example, the menu at the store may look like this:

Hamburger $3.49
Fries $0.99
Pop $1.09
Ice Cream $2.19
Value Meal (1 Hamburger, 1 Fries, 1 Pop) $4.79
Lovers-Only (2 Hamburgers, 2 Fries, 2 Pops, 1 Ice Cream) $9.99

Buying a combo is cheaper than buying its items individually.

A parent of many kids (or a coach of many students) face this recurring problem: I need to get, say,
9 hamburgers, 6 fries, and 8 pops. How do I fit this into the menu, using the combo deals optimally, so
as to pay as little as possible? Note that I am a conservativist, so I dont buy more food than I need.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases, each of them with a menu and several orders.

1. Menu: Individual items, then combos.

(a) Individual items: number of items I  6, then their prices (at most $10 each).
(b) Combos: number of combos (at most 8), then for each combo, its composition as an I-tuple

of quantities and its price.

Example: the sample input below encodes the menu above.

2. Orders: number of orders (at most 10), then for each order, an I-tuple of the wanted quantities.
Each element in the tuples is at most 9.

All prices are integers in cents.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each order of each case, output the minimum payment in cents on its own line.

```
