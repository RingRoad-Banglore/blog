Ivan works at a factory that produces heavy machinery. He has a simple job  he knocks up wooden
boxes of different sizes to pack machinery for delivery to the customers. Each box is a rectangular
parallelepiped. Ivan uses six rectangular wooden pallets to make a box. Each pallet is used for one side
of the box.

Joe delivers pallets for Ivan. Joe is not very smart and often makes mistakes  he brings Ivan
pallets that do not fit together to make a box. But Joe does not trust Ivan. It always takes a lot of
time to explain Joe that he has made a mistake.

Fortunately, Joe adores everything related to computers and sincerely believes that computers never
make mistakes. Ivan has decided to use this for his own advantage. Ivan asks you to write a program
that given sizes of six rectangular pallets tells whether it is possible to make a box out of them.
