---


## Input

```
There are several points on the plane named beauty points. Given a point A, its ugliness is defined as
|AB|+ |AC|, where B and C are two beauty points nearest to A.

Your task is: given beauty points, find the most beautiful point, i.e., the point having least ugliness.

Note: the most beautiful point doesnt have to be a beauty point.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains the number of the test cases, which is at most 10. The descriptions
of the test cases follow. The first line of a test case descriptions contains an integer N (2  N  10000),
which is the number of beauty points. Each of the next N lines contains two integers X and Y separated
by a space (10000  X,Y  10000) being the coordinates of a beauty point. No two beauty points
in a test case description have the same coordinates. The test cases are separated by blank lines.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input, output the coordinates of any most beautiful point separated by a space,
with at least three digits after the decimal point. Print a blank line between test cases.
