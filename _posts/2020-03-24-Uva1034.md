## Input

```
Global Positioning System (GPS) is a navigation system based on a set of satellites orbiting approxi-
mately 20,000 kilometers above the earth. Each satellite follows a known orbit and transmits a radio
signal that encodes the current time. If a GPS-equipped vehicle has a very accurate clock, it can com-
pare its own local time with the time encoded in the signals received from the satellites. Since radio
signals propagate at a known rate, the vehicle can compute the distance between its current location
and the location of the satellite when the signal was broadcast. By measuring its distance from several
satellites in known orbits, a vehicle can compute its position very accurately.

You must write a simple autopilot program based on GPS navigation. To make the problem
easier, we state it as a two-dimen sional problem. In other words, you do not need to take into account
the curvature of the earth or the altitude of the satellites. Furthermore, the problem uses speeds that
are more appropriate for airplanes and sound waves than for satellites and radio waves.

Given a set of signals from moving sources, your program must compute the receiving position on
the Cartesian plane. Then, given a destination point on the plane, your program must compute the
compass heading required to go from the receiving position to the destination. All compass headings
are stated in degrees. Compass heading 0 (North) corresponds to the positive y direction, and compass
heading 90 (East) corresponds to the positive x direction, as shown in Figure 1.

## Output

```
The input consists of multiple data sets.

The first line of input in each data set contains an integer N (1  N  10), which is the number of
signal sources in the set. This is followed by three floating point numbers: t, x, and y. Here, t denotes
the exact local time when all the signals are received, represented in seconds after the reference time
(time 0), and x and y represent the coordinates of the destination point on the Cartesian plane. Each
of the next N lines contains four floating-point numbers that carry information about one signal source.

The first two numbers represent the known position of the signal source on the Cartesian plane at the
reference time. The third number represents the direction of travel of the signal source in the form of
a compass heading D (0  D < 360). The fourth number is the time that is encoded in the signal-that
is, the time when the signal was transmitted, represented in seconds after the reference time. The
magnitudes of all numbers in the input file are less than 10000 and no floating-point number has more
than 5 digits after the decimal point.

The last data set is followed by a line containing four zeros.
The unit distance in the coordinate space is one meter. Assume that each signal source is moving

over the Cartesian plane at a speed of 100 meters per second and that the broadcast signal propagates
at a speed of 350 meters per second. Due to inaccuracies in synchronizing clocks, assume that your
distance calculations are accurate only to 0.1 meter. That is, if two points are computed to be within
0.1 meter of each other, you should treat them as the same point. There is also the possibility that
a signal may have been corrupted in transmission, so the data received from multiple signals may be
inconsistent.

## Sample Input

```
For each trial, print the trial number followed by the compass heading from the receiving location to the
destination, in degrees rounded to the nearest integer. Use the labeling as shown in the example output.
If the signals do not contain enough information to compute the receiving location (that is, more than
one position is consistent with the signals), print Inconclusive. If the signals are inconsistent (that
is, no position is consistent with the signals), print Inconsistent. If the receiving location is within
0.1 meter of the destination, print Arrived. If the situation is Inconclusive or Inconsistent, then you
do not need to consider the case Arrived.

Figure 2 above corresponds to the first sample input. The locations of the three satellites at time
t = 0 are A (-100,350), B (350,-100) and C (350,800). The signals received by the GPS unit were
transmitted at time t = 1.75, when the satellites were at locations A, B, and C (however, in general
the signals received by the GPS unit might have been transmitted at different times). The signals from
the three satellites converge at D at time t = 2.53571, which means D is the location of the receiving
GPS unit. From point D, a compass course of 45 degrees leads toward the destination point of (1050,
1050).
