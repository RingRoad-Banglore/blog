title: Uva 01076  Password Suspects
---


## Input

```
You are the computer whiz for the secret organization known as the Sneaky Underground Smug Perpe-
trators of Evil Crimes and Thefts. The target for SUSPECTs latest evil crime is their greatest foe, the
Indescribably Clever Policemens Club, and everything is prepared. Everything, except for one small
thing: the secret password for ICPCs main computer system.

The password is known to consist only of lowercase letters a-z. Furthermore, through various
sneaky observations, you have been able to determine the length of the password, as well as a few (pos-
sibly overlapping) substrings of the password, though you do not know exactly where in the password
they occur.

For instance, say that you know that the password is 10 characters long, and that you have observed
the substrings hello and world. Then the password must be either helloworld or worldhello.

The question is whether this information is enough to reduce the number of possible passwords to
a reasonable amount. To answer this, your task is to write a program that determines the number of
possible passwords and, if there are at most 42 of them, prints them all.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers
N and M (1  N  25, 0  M  10), giving the length of the password and the number of known
substrings respectively. This is followed by M lines, each containing a known substring. Each known
substring consists of between 1 and 10 lowercase letters a-z.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number (beginning with 1) followed by Y suspects, where Y is the
number of possible passwords for this case. If the number of passwords is at most 42, then output all
possible passwords in alphabetical order, one per line.

The input will be such that the number of possible passwords at most 1015.

```

## Sample Output

```
10 2
hello
world
10 0
4 1
icpc
0 0
