---


## Input

```text

A partition of a polygon P is a decomposition of P in which the component subpolygons do not overlap
except at their boundaries. The elements that are obtained by means of the partition of P are called
pieces.

A polygon is called orthogonal if its edges meet at right angles. If each of the pieces of a partition
are rectangular, then the partition is a rectilinear partition. A rectilinear partition of an orthogonal
polygon can be obtained by extending each edge incident to a reflex vertex (the interior angle between
its two incident vertices is at least ) of P through the interior of P until it hits the boundary of P
(see Figure (a)).

Write a program that, given a sequence of vertices, determine the rectilinear partition of a simple
orthogonal polygon without holes.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line contains an integer N , 6  N  50, which is the number of vertices in the orthogonal
polygon. The following N lines contain two non-negative integers X and Y , 0  X, Y  20, separated
by a space. Each of the pairs (X,Y ) specify the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of a vertex. (See
the Sample Input, which corresponds to the situation in the Figure (a) above.)

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The output is the rectilinear partition of the polygon, where each set of four lines represent a
rectilinear piece. The pieces must be listed from left to right and from top to bottom. The vertexes of
each piece must be listed as indicated in Figure (b).
