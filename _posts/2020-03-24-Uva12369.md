## Input

```text
Taha has got a standard deck of cards with him. In addition to
the 52 regular ones, there are 2 joker cards. Every regular card
has a rank and a suit. The ranks in ascending order are: A, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q and K. The suit of a card can be clubs,
diamonds, hearts or spades. That means there are 13 clubs, 13
diamonds, 13 hearts and 13 spades  which adds up to 52. The
joker cards have no ranks or suits.

One day, Sara gave Taha a challenge. First she randomly
shuffles the 54 cards and starts placing one card after another,
face-up, on a table. What is the expected number of cards Sara has to place so that there are at least
C clubs, D diamonds, H hearts and S spades on the table? Whenever a joker card is encountered, Taha
has to assign it to some suit so that the expected number of cards to reach the goal is minimized. The
decision of assigning the joker card to some suit has to be made instantly (i.e. before Sara puts the
next card on the table). Note that the assignments of the two joker cards dont necessarily need to be
the same.
```

## Output

```text
First line of input is an integer T (T < 50) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case consists
of a line containing 4 integers in the order C, D, H and S. Each of these integers will be in the range
[0, 15].

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output the case number first. Then output the expected number of cards Sara needs to
place on the table to achieve the goal (rounded to 3 decimal places). If its impossible to reach the goal,
irrespective of what assignments Sara opts for, output -1.000 (without the quotes) instead. Look at
samples for exact format. Judge inputs are such that small precision errors wont cause error in the
output. If the output is 0.000, make sure that you dont print it as 0.000 (without the quotes).

Illustration of the Samples:

1) There is no need to place any card as all required values are 0

2) We must place all the 54 cards to reach the goal

3) Note that output isnt always an integer

4) 60 Cards? No way!!
