title: Uva 13186  Tobby and the quaseEquals strings
---


```
Tobby always enjoys playing with strings, and now he brings to you a nice problem with them. Of
course, since Tobby is a lazy dog, he has not solved it yet and hopes that you can solve it for him.

Tobby got a set of strings S of size N (where every string has the same length L). He also has Q
queries.

For each query a string A of size L is given and Tobby wants to know how many strings in S are
quaseEquals to A for every i (1  i  L).

Two strings are quaseEquals to one another for an index i if they are equal after deleting the i-th
character from both strings.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases, read until the end of file (EOF). In the first line of each test
case there are three integers: N , Q, L (1  N,Q,L  105). The next N lines contain the strings in
S, all of length L. Finally Q strings of length L are given, those are the queries. It is guaranteed that
(1  NL  100000) and (1  QL  100000) and that all strings in the input contain only english
lowercase letters (a..z).

```

## Output

```
For each query print the number of strings in S that are quaseEquals to the string in the query for
every position 1  i  L.

Explanation:
For the first sample, if the character i = 1 is removed, then S = {ab, ba, aa} and A = {aa} and we

got 1 pair of quaseEquals strings. If the character i = 2 is removed, then S = {ab, aa, aa} and A = {aa}
and we got 2 pairs of quaseEquals strings. If the character i = 3 is removed, then S = {aa, ab, aa} and
A = {aa} and we got 2 pairs of quaseEquals strings, so our answer is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

## Sample Input

```
3 1 3
aab
aba
aaa
aaa

```

## Sample Output

```
5
