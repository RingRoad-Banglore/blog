## Input

```
OK. Lets go right.

Bartholomew Furrow

A graph, G, consists of a finite set of vertices, V, and a set of edges, E, where each edge is a set
of 2 vertices {u, v}. A walk in G is a finite sequence of vertices (v1, v2, . . . , vk), such that for each
pair (vi1, vi) for i in [2, k], {vi1, vi} is in E. This is called a walk from v1 to vk. If V is a set of
integers, then any two walks in G can be compared lexicographically; for example, the walk (3, 5, 6, 2,
8) is smaller than the walk (3, 5, 6, 5, 7). A walk, W, from a to b is lexicographically smallest if there
is no other walk from a to b in G that is smaller than W. A drive is a walk (v1, v2, . . ., vk), where no
edge is used twice consecutively. That is, for all i from 2 up to k  1, vi1 is not equal to vi+1.

Given G and a start vertex, s, your task is to find the lexicographically smallest drives from s to
each vertex in G.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a line
containing the integers n, m and s. (0  n  100, 0  m  4950). The next m lines will list the edges
of G. V is the set {0, 1, . . . , n 1}. s is in V.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the line Case #x:, where x is the number of the test case. Then print
n lines, line i listing the lexicographically smallest drive from s to i using single spaces to separate
consecutive vertices. If there is no such drive, print No drive. Put an empty line after each test case.
