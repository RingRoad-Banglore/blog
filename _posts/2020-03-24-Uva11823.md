## Input

```text
Tekuhp is a tourist city. There are N intersections in the city, connected with M one-way roads. Each
one-way road connects from some intersection to another. There maybe many roads that connect a pair
of intersections. To make the city very amazing, the roads are constructed so that it is not possible to
start at some intersection, travel along the roads, and return to the starting intersection. (It remains a
strange secret how people of Tekuhp return home from work each day.)

There are two groups of tourists planning to visit the city. They want to travel along the roads from
some intersection to another. However, both groups do not want to run into each other. So they want
two paths P1 and P2, each Pi, for 1  i  2, starts at some intersection si and ends at intersection
ti, such that both paths share no intersections, including the starting and the ending intersections.
However, it is possible that a path Pi may contain only one node, i. e., si = ti.

Tourists also want to visit many places. Since you are a good planner, you want to maximize the
total number of intersections in both path.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains an integer T (1  T  10), the number of test cases. After that T test
cases follow.

Each test case starts with integers N and M (1  N  300; 1  M  3, 000), where N denotes the
number of intersections and M denotes the number of roads. The intersections are numbered from 1
to N . After that M lines, describing road connection, follow. Each line contains two integers A and B
denoting that there is a one-way road from intersection A to intersection B.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output must contain T lines, each line for each test case. For each test case, the output contains
an integer L denoting the maximum number of intersections in two non-intersecting paths.
