title: Uva 10498  Happiness!
---


## Input

```text
Prof. Kaykobad has given Nasa the duty of buying some food for the ACM contestents. Nasa decided
to buy n different items. He then asked each of the m contestents how much of each item they want to
eat. They could not give any logical answer, they only want as much as they wish! Nasa knows quite
well that they would only waste their food if they get as much as they want. He was determined not
to let that happen.

So he tactfully found out from each of the contestents how much happiness one gets from each
piece of each item and what is the total happiness over which one wastes food. It may be the case
that someone gets zero happiness on some item(s). He decided that he would never let anyone have
such amount of food that exceeds his total happiness. He planned that he would give someone even a
fraction of a piece of item, but never give anyone more than he needed!

He also decided that each would get exactly the same amount of each item so that no one can
complain against him.

After planning all these, he finally realized that he has an infinite amount of money and hence, he
would spend as much money as he can.
