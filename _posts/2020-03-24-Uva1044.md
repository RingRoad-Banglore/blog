title: Uva 01044  Tiling the Plane
---


## Input

```
A polygon is said to tile the plane if a collection of identical copies of the polygon can be assembled
to fill an unbounded two-dimensional plane without any gaps or overlap. For example, Figure 1 shows
an L-shaped polygon, and Figure 2 shows how a portion of the plane can be tiled with copies of the
polygon. You must write a program to determine whether a given polygon can tile the plane.

Each test case consists of a closed polygon in which every vertex is at a right angle and the length
of every side is an integer multiple of a unit length. You may make as many copies of the polygon as
you like, and you may move them over the plane, but you may not rotate or reflect any polygon.

You might find the following information useful: It is known that there are only two fundamentally
different tilings of the plane, the regular tiling by squares (chessboard tiling) and the tiling by regular
hexagons (honeycomb tiling). A polygon can therefore tile the plane if and only if it satisfies one of the
following two conditions:

1. There are points A, B, C, D in order on the polygon boundary (the points are not necessarily
vertices of the polygon) such that the polygon boundaries from A to B and from D to C are
congruent and the boundaries from B to C and from A to D are congruent. This leads to a tiling
equivalent to the square tiling.

2. There are points A, B, C, D, E, F in order on the polygon boundary, such that the boundary
pairs AB and ED, BC and FE, CD and AF are congruent. This leads to a tiling equivalent to the
hexagon tiling.
```

## Output

```
The input contains the descriptions of several polygons, each description consisting of one input line.
Each description begins with an integer n (4  n  50) that represents the number of sides of the

polygon. This number is followed by descriptions of n line segments which (taken in order) form a
counterclockwise traversal of the perimeter of the polygon. Each line segment description consists of
a letter followed by an integer. The letter is N, E, S, or W, representing the direction of the line
segment as North, East, South, or West, respectively. The integer represents the length of the line
segment as a multiple of the unit length. The described polygon will not touch or intersect itself.

The input is terminated by a line consisting of the integer zero.

## Sample Input

```
For each polygon in the input, print one output line. Print the number of the polygon in the input,
followed by the word Possible if it is possible to tile the plane with the test polygon, or Impossible
otherwise. Follow the format of the sample output.
