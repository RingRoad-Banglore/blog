## Input

```text
This problem relates the digits 3, 2, 1 and 0. Everyone knows
that binary numbers are built of 1s and 0s. Now suppose that
you are given N cards of 3 and M cards of 2. Is it possible to
pick K cards out of them to build a K-digit decimal number such
that all the K least significant digits of its binary representation
are zeros?

For example, if you are given one card of each type, you can
form the number 32, whose binary representation 100000 ends
with  2 zeros. However, if both cards have the same value, you
cannot form a 2-digit number that satisfies the requirement.
```

## Output

```text
Input contains no more than 1000 test cases, each given in a line with three non-negative integers N ,
M and K. All input numbers are smaller than 1000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the smallest satisfying K-digit number if found, or Impossible. otherwise.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1 1 2
2 0 2

```
