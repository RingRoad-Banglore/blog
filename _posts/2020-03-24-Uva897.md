title: Uva 00897  Anagrammatic Primes
---


## Input

```
A number greater than one is prime if it has no divisors other than itself and 1 (note that 1 is not
prime). For example, 23 is prime and 35 is not prime because 35 = 7  5. When the digits of a number
are rearranged, its primeness may change  for example, 35 is not prime but 53 is. For this problem,
you have to find numbers which are prime no matter how you rearrange their digits. For example, all
of the numbers 113, 131 and 311 are prime, so we say that 113 is an anagrammatic prime (also 131 and
311 are anagrammatic primes).
```

## Output

```
Each line of input will contain a single positive number n, less than 10,000,000. You must find the first
anagrammatic prime which is larger than n and less than the next power of 10 greater than n. The
input will be terminated by a line consisting of a single 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each number in the input, one line of output must be produced. This output line should contain
either the next anagrammatic prime, as described above, or 0 if there is no anagrammatic prime in
the range defined.

```

## Sample Output

```
10
16
900
113
8000000
0
