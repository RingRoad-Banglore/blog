title: Uva 10217  A Dinner with Schwarzenegger!!!
---


## Input

```text

Fig: Arnold Schwarzenegger as
Terminator

One of your friends informed you that a nearby theater in your
city has given a new offer. It will show the super hit Schwarzeneg-
ger movie Terminator 2. While selling ticket they will keep record
of the buyers birthdays. If someones birthday matches the birth-
day of a person who has bought ticket before him, he (the one
who bought ticket later) will be given the honor to have din-
ner with Schwarzenegger. To give the guy at the front of the
queue some chance, his birthday will be compared with the ticket
sellers birthday. If you were given the chance, which position of
the queue would you have wanted? (I know that many of you
would have liked other names as a dinner partner. Dont hesitate
to replace Schwarzenegger with that name, as you may need all
those inspirations to solve this problem).
