title: Uva 10612  Paper Folding
---


## Input

```
Often when inserting a paper into a letter, you have to fold the paper one or more times to make it fit.
Depending on how you fold it, different parts of the original view will be visible after the folding. You
are to write a program which 1) calculates which part of the paper is at the front given a sequence of
foldings, 2) calculates how to fold a paper given the wanted visible part.

There are 8 possible different ways to fold a paper if you want to halve the size of the paper. Those
are:

 Folding the left half of the paper over the right half (l)

 Folding the right half of the paper over the left half (r)

 Folding the top half of the paper over the bottom half (t)

 Folding the bottom half of the paper over the top half (b)

 Folding the left half of the paper below the right half (L)

 Folding the right half of the paper below the left half (R)

 Folding the top half of the paper below the bottom half (T)

 Folding the bottom half of the paper below the top half (B)

In this problem, the size of the paper is 1048576 1048576 units (by pure coincidence, this means
that the length of the sides of the paper after up to 20 foldings will always be an integer). The
coordinates of the top left corner of the paper is (0, 0) and the bottom right (1048576, 1048576). This
is the case for both the front of the paper as well as the back. Thus, if you would (for some reason)
turn the paper by flipping it horizontally, you would have the coordinate 0, 0 to your upper right.

For instance, if your first fold is a t, the top half of the paper is folded so the top half of the backside
of the paper appears on the front. The visible part (the front) will then be (0, 0)  (1048576, 524288)
from the back side of the original view.

You may assume that the foldings are razor sharp. In reality it would be next to impossible to fold
a paper in half 20 times!

## Output

```
The first line in the input file contains an integer n which is the number of cases to follow.

Next follows n lines, each describing either 1) a folding sequence or 2) a wanted visible part. A
folding sequence is described as a string containing between 1 and 20 characters from the set of valid
folding characters (l, r, t, b, L, R, T, B). A visible part is given in the format (x1, y1)(x2, y2) S
where x1, y1 and x2, y2 are the coordinates of the corners of the part (x1 < x2, y1 < y2) and S is either
F (if the front side of the original view is desired) or B (back side).

## Sample Input

```
For each input line you should output one line in the exact same format as the input (but for the
opposite case!). See sample output for details.

In case there are more than one folding sequence (you may assume there are at least one) yielding
the desired part, you should output the lexicographically smallest of them. That is, the preference
order of the foldings should be B, L, R, T, b, l, r, t.
