## Input

```
Sometimes, going shopping with grandma can be a very exciting and fun adventure! Eloi is going
shopping with grandma this evening because of the holidays; just perfect for his saying: Sewing,
baking, and shopping with grandma, it all goes together a grandmother, at holiday time, is worth
gold. They also are stopping at the pharmacy: granny is losing her memory and her bottle of memory
pills is running low ... how sad!

The memory pills come in two sizes: large and small.
The dose in each large pill is equivalent to that in two small
ones. Eloi observes granny picks a pill at random from the
bottle every day: if its a small one, she takes it; otherwise,
she splits it and takes a half, replacing the other which is
from then on considered a small pill.

Given a certain bottle with l large pills and s small pills,
we say that the pair (l, s) is the bottle configuration. Eloi
is interested in the pill tree associated with bottle config-
uration (l, s), in which left or right branching represents
a large or small pill being picked, respectively. Formally
its the labeled binary tree with root (l, s) in which a node
(u, v) has a left child (u1, v+1) if u > 0 and a right child
(u, v  1) if v > 0.

For example, the pill tree associated with bottle config-
uration (2, 1) (2 large, 1 small) is depicted on the right:

Eloi then asks himself: how many nodes does the pill tree associated with bottle configuration (l, s)
have?
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of a line with two blank-separated
integers l and s (0  l  1000 and 0  s  1000).

The end of the input is given by l = s = 0, which should not be processed as a test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each l and s, output a line with the number of nodes in the pill tree associated to (l, s). Since this
number can be very large, print it modulo 9 999 959 999.

```

## Sample Output

```
2 1
6 5
100 2
19 78
1000 1000
0 0
