title: Uva 13212  How many inversions
---


```
Humbertov Moralov in his student days, he is attended system engineering at University of missing
hill. He was evaluated in its first course of Analysis of Algorithms (at the first half of 1997) with the
following topics and questions:
Inversions:

Let A[1 . . . n] an array of distinct integers of size n. If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i, j) is
called an inversion of A.

Given the above definition about an inversion, Humbertov Moralov must answer the following ques-
tions:

1. List all inversions in 3, 2, 8, 1, 6.

2. What array of size n, with all the numbers from the set 1, 2, 3, . . . , n has the largest amount of
inversions? How many inversions?

3. Write an algorithm to determine the number of inversions in any permutation of n elements with
(n logn) in the worst case run time.

Humbertov Moralov answered questions 1. and 2. without any problem, but he was not able to
solve the question 3 at time. Days later he thought the following solution:

1: inv 0
2: function Merge(A[], p, q, r)
3: n1  qp+ 1
4: n2  rq
5: create arrays L[1 . . . n1 + 1] and R[1 . . . n2 + 1]
6: for i = 1 to n1 do
7: L[i] A[p+ i1]
8: end for
9: for j = 1 to n2 do

10: R[j] A[q + j]
11: end for
12: L[n1 + 1]
13: R[n2 + 1]
14: i 1
15: j  1
16: for k = p to r do
17: if L[i]  R[j] then
18: A[k] L[i]
19: i i+ 1
20: else
21: A[k] R[j]
22: j  j + 1
23: inv inv + n1i+ 1
24: end if
25: end for
26: end function



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 13212  How many inversions? 2/2

27: function MergeSort(A[], p, r)
28: if p < r then
29: q  (p+ r)/2
30: MergeSort(A[], p, q)
31: MergeSort(A[], q + 1, r)
32: Merge(A[], p, q, r)
33: end if
34: end function

Will this code solve the problem? Just adding the lines 1 and 23 will be enough to solve the problem?
Please help Humbertov Moralov to validate this solution! For this, you must implement this solution

in any of the programming languages accepted by the ACM-ICPC and verify if the expected results are
generated.
```

## Input

```
The input may contain several test cases. Each input case begins with a positive integer n (1  n  106)
denoting the length of A, followed by n distinct lines. Each line contains a positive integer from array
A. For i  [1, n], will meet that 0  A[i]  108. The input ends with a test case in which n is zero, and
this case must not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, your program must print a positive integer representing the total number of inversions
in the array A. Each valid test case must generate just one output line.
