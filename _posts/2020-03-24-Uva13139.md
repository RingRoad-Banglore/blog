title: Uva 13139  Lucas Numbers
---


```
Ailin is a beautiful girl who likes math and one day she decides to study about series in order to distract
herself. She starts reading about the Lucas series and because she likes the numbers greater than two,
she defines the series:

L(n) =



3 if n = 1
4 if n = 2
L(n 1) + L(n 2) if n  3

Ailin also likes the trees, so she has a weighted tree, and she needs to run Q queries on the tree,
each of which can be one of the following two types:

 1 A B: Calculate the distance between A and B.

 2 A B: Add the first elements of the Lucas series to the edges which lie on a simple path between
nodes A and B.

Its Saturday and she wants to solve the problem quickly and then go to shopping... Can you help
her?
```

## Input

```
Input contains several test cases. The first line in the each test case contains a single integer n, the
number of vertices in the tree (1  n  105). The next n  1 lines contains three integers ai, bi and
ci (1  ai, bi  n, 1  ci  109) describing the edges of the graph, it means a edge with ci distance
between nodes ai and bi (the vertices are indexed from 1 to n). Next line contains an integer Q, the
number of queries (1  Q  105). The next Q lines contains three integers T , A and B (1  A,B  n,
1  T  2) describing the queries. The distance between nodes may be very large, so compute the
answers modulo 109 + 7. There is at least one query of the first type.

See the examples below for more details.

```

## Output

```
For each query of type 1, output one line with the answer required.
