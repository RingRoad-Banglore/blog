title: Uva 12822  Extraordinarily large LED
---


## Input

```

Youre arranging a basket ball match in your university. In order to attract more people to watch the
game, you decided to use an extraordinarily large LED display for the scores. However, the huge LED
will consume a lot of power, so you would like to estimate the cost by analyzing some past games in
your university.

Your LED display consists of 6 traditional seven-segment digits, 3 digits for each team. When a
segment is on, it consumes one unit of power per second. When off, it does not consume any power at
all. Scores are shown without leading zeros except that for score 0, a single digit 0 is shown.
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 100 test cases. For each case, the first line is always START hh:mm:ss which
means the game starts at hh : mm : ss. The last line is always END hh:mm:ss which means the game
ends at the beginning of hh : mm : ss. There will be at least one SCORE information between START
and END, formatted as SCORE hh:mm:ss team score, where team is either home or guest, score
is 1, 2 or 3. The information will be sorted in increasing order of time, and no two times are equal.
The game will start no earlier than 9:00 and will end no later than 21:00 in the same day. Note that if
the start time is 09:00:00 and the end time is 09:00:01, the game duration is 1 second, not 2 seconds.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the total power consumed.
