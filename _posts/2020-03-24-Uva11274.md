title: Uva 11274  Infinite Resistor Network
---


```
First, we begin with a square of side length L.
Connect the centers of each side to form an-
other square. Connect the centers of each side
of this square to form yet another square, and
so on, to infinity. Suppose now that all the lines
in the diagram are uniform wires. Let the resis-
tance of a piece of wire of the Length L (length
of a side of the outer most square) be exactly
1. Let the net resistance between the points A
and B be R.

Compute the k-th digit after the decimal
point of the value R. Namely, let R =
0.n1n2n3 . . . nk . . . Given k, output nk.
```

## Input

```
The input of each test cases is simply the value
k (k < 10000000), 0 < min(k, 990  104  k) <
104 on its own line.

```

## Output

```
For each input value, output the k-th digit of R on a single line.
