```
Black Vienna is a puzzle game where players try to de-
duce the secret identities of the three spies. There are 26
suspects, represented by cards with a single letter from A
to Z. Suspect cards are shuffled and three are secretly set
aside; these form the Black Vienna circle. The remaining
23 cards are distributed between the two players. Note that
players will necessarily get a different number of cards; one
player may also get all 23 cards while the other gets none.

The objective of the puzzle is to deduce which of the sus-
pects are in the Black Vienna circle using players replies to
investigations; each investigation consists of a pair of sus-
pects and the players reply is the number of those suspects
that are in his/her hand. Using several investigations it is
possible to narrow which suspects can be in the Black Vi-
enna circle (i.e., those that are not in any of the players
hands).

Write a program that reads a sequence of investiga-
tion replies and counts the number of admissible solutions,
i.e. possible sets of three suspects representing the members
of the Black Vienna circle. Note that it is possible that the players replies are inconsistent and therefore
that the puzzle has no solution.

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The input consists of a line with the number N of investigations followed by N lines; each line
consists of a sequence of two distinct letters (from A to Z), a player number (1 or 2) and a reply (an
integer from 0 to 2).

Constraints:

0  N  50 Number of investigations.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output is the number of distinct admissible solutions, i.e. sets of three members
of the Black Vienna circle.
