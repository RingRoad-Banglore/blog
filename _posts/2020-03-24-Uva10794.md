## Input

```text
It is now 10000 AD. In this problem we will
talk about the resumption of a World wide gam-
ing festival named Olympic, which used to take
place long ago in the twentieth century. The
game of Olympic upheld the desire for peace
(missing now a days), friendship and many
other good things among nations. But it itself
was also a contest a desire to win, a desire to
outplay the opponent. As time has passed by,
man has become more aggressive or cruel for
success. So the newly formed International
Olympic Committee (IOC) has decided to
encourage such desires by including wrestling
like game which had its origin some 9,000
years ago from today and its brutality enjoyed
the patronage of many royal houses. But IOC has introduced some technological changes in the game.
They have decided to follow the format of dogfight used in war. Both the opponents will bring their
best possible aircrafts (provided by their own countrys air force) loaded with missiles. At some point
one of them will throw a missile to another player. At the same time the other player will also throw a
missile to stop the opponents one. If both of them survive, the game will continue. The commentators
want to predict the result of the game (as they always do) before it happens. So, they are aided with a
computer to calculate the minimum possible distance between the thrown missiles. You are appointed
to write the necessary program for it.

To make things easier, it is assumed that the missiles used here always travel in a straight line until
they are hindered by another missile. Here all positions are considered in three-dimensional space. You
can ignore any effect of the existence of the aircrafts.

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T (1  T  500) denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test
case has three lines. First line has a positive integer time. Second line of a test case has six integers x1,
y1, z1, x2, y2, z2. (x1, y1, z1) is the current position of the first player from where he throws the missile
and (x2, y2, z2) is the position of the missile after time seconds. The third line contains the same set of
information for the second contestant. All values are less than 10000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
There should be one line of output for each test case. At first print Case i:  (without the quotes)
where i is an integer denoting the i-th test case starting from one. Then print the minimum possible
distance between the two missiles in the same line with four digits after the decimal point. See the
sample output below for exact formatting.
