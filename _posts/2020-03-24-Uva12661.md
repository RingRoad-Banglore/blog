title: Uva 12661  Funny Car Racing
---


## Input

```text

There is a funny car racing in a city with n junctions and m directed roads.
The funny part is: each road is open and closed periodically. Each road is associate with two

integers (a, b), that means the road will be open for a seconds, then closed for b seconds, then open for
a seconds. . . All these start from the beginning of the race. You must enter a road when its open, and
leave it before its closed again.

Your goal is to drive from junction s and arrive at junction t as early as possible. Note that you
can wait at a junction even if all its adjacent roads are closed.
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 30 test cases. The first line of each case contains four integers n, m, s, t
(1  n  300, 1  m  50, 000, 1  s, t  n). Each of the next m lines contains five integers u, v, a,
b, t (1  u, v  n, 1  a, b, t  105), that means there is a road starting from junction u ending with
junction v. Its open for a seconds, then closed for b seconds (and so on). The time needed to pass this
road, by your car, is t. No road connects the same junction, but a pair of junctions could be connected
by more than one road.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the shortest time, in seconds. Its always possible to arrive at t from s.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3 2 1 3

1 2 5 6 3

2 3 7 7 6

3 2 1 3

1 2 5 6 3

2 3 9 5 6

```
