title: Uva 10013  Super long sums
---


## Input

```
The creators of a new programming language D++ have found out that whatever limit for SuperLongInt
type they make, sometimes programmers need to operate even larger numbers. A limit of 1000 digits
is so small... You have to find the sum of two numbers with maximal size of 1.000.000 digits.
```

## Output

```
The first line of a input file is an integer N , then a blank line followed by N input blocks. The first line
of an each input block contains a single number M (1  M  1000000)  the length of the integers (in
order to make their lengths equal, some leading zeroes can be added). It is followed by these integers
written in columns. That is, the next M lines contain two digits each, divided by a space. Each of the
two given integers is not less than 1, and the length of their sum does not exceed M .

There is a blank line between input blocks.

```

## Sample Input

```
Each output block should contain exactly M digits in a single line representing the sum of these two
integers.

There is a blank line between output blocks.
