title: Uva 12430  Grand Wedding

## Input

```text
Finally its the big day. The sultan is getting married. Kings, Queens and Diplomats around the world
are coming to attend the Sultans weddings. But alas!!! Just before the grand day the royal treasury
was raided. And the Sultan is now very upset about the security of his guests. As the Sultans minister
of homeland security your job is to ensure that the whole kingdom is secured and the grand day goes
on without any drift. The sultan wants that:

1. Every road in the kingdom is secured by a royal guard.

2. The royal guards are highly trained. When they are standing on a road intersection they can
keep an eye on every road meeting at that intersection. And you have to place the guards on the
intersection.

3. But guards are human too!! They get bored while standing on the intersections. When they see
another fellow guard on the other end of a road leaving his intersection he starts to chat with him
and sometimes forget what he was supposed to do!!! The Sultan wants you to place them in such
way that this incident never occurs.

4. You have to ensure that conditions (1, 2, and 3) are met, and to do this you may even ask the
civil works department to demolish a proper subset of the kingdom roads. The people in the civil
works department are very lazy. They are so lazy that they do not want to have a list of roads
and go demolish them. They just ask for a road length K and demolish all the roads with length
greater or equal to K.

Now you have to secure the kingdom by conditions [1, 2, 3 and 4] and also maximize K if any road
is needed to be demolished.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input will contain an integer T which is the number of test cases. Each of the T test
cases will begin with an integer pair N and M which are the number of intersections and number of
kingdom roads respectively. The intersections are numbered from 1 to N . After that, M lines will
follow. Each line contains 3 integers a, b, w which means there is a road between intersections a and b
of w length. A road between intersections (a, b) implies a road between intersections (b, a) with same
length as well.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case you have to print a single integer in a separate line, the maximum K if any road is
required to be demolished tosecure the kingdom by conditions [1, 2, 3 and 4]. Print 0 if no road is
required to be demolished. Print -1 if it is impossible to secure the kingdom by conditions [1, 2, 3
and 4].
