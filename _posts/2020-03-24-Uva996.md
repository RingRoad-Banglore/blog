title: Uva 00996  Find the Sequence
---


## Input

```text

The problem of finding the next term of a given sequence of numbers is usually proposed in QI tests.
We want to construct a method and a codification that allow us to know all the sequence from the first
N terms.

Let S = (Si)iIN denote a sequence of real numbers whose i-order term is Si. We codify a constant
sequence with the following operator:

S = [n] meaning that Si = n i  IN,

where n  ZZ. We also define the following operators on a given sequence of numbers S = (Si)iIN:

V = [m+ S] meaning that Vi =

{
m , i = 1
Vi1 + Si1 , i > 1

;

V = [m  S] meaning that Vi =
{
m  S1 , i = 1
Vi1  Si , i > 1

;

where m  IN. For example we have the following codifications:
[2 + [1]] = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6    [1 + [2 + [1]]] = 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36   

[2  [1 + [2 + [1]]]] = 2, 6, 36, 360, 5400, 113400    [2  [5 + [2]]] = 10, 30, 30,30, 90,450, 3150   
Given a sequence of N integer numbers and an integer M , the problem is to write the codification

that generate the sequence and have at most M operators. We have that 2  N  51 and 1  M  50.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases. For each of them, the program input is a single line containing
M followed by the list of first terms of the sequence. The terms of the given sequence are positive (in
the interval [1, 200000]) or negative integers (in the interval [-200000, -1]), and their number N can
differ but it is always greater than M .

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the program output is a single line containing the codification without any space. If
there exists no solution with at most M operators, the output must be [0].

Examples

Input Output

2 2 3 4 [2+[1]]

3 1 3 6 10 15 [1+[2+[1]]]

4 2 6 36 360 5400 113400 [2*[1+[2+[1]]]]

```

## Sample Output

```text
3 10 30 30 -30 90 -450 3150

2 2 6 36 360 5400 113400

```
