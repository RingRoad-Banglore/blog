title: Uva 11948  Reading a Quadtree
---


```
A quadtree, first introduced by Finkel and Bentley, is a tree data-structure in which each internal
node has exactly four children. Quadtrees are often used for problems that can be mapped into a
two-dimensional space which is then recursively subdivided it into four equally-sized regions while a
certain condition holds. The problem consists in reading a compressed binary image represented with
a quadtree and determining which pixels are set to white.

For a better understanding of this problem, consider the third test case from Sample Input, repre-
sented in the figure. The uncompressed binary image is composed by (8 x 8) pixels, where 35 of them
are white. Notice each node in the quadtree is mapped into a square area from the target image. White
nodes denote areas composed by white pixels exclusively, whereas black nodes denote areas with only
black pixels; finally, gray nodes are composed by white and black pixels and thus, they need to be
subdivided into four new square areas. Notice that the order of visiting square areas is: left to right
and top to bottom.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains an integer N > 0 denoting the number of test cases.
The next N lines start each with the length L of the target image; L has to be a power of 2.
The length is followed by a space and a sequence of 0, 1 and *, denoting black, white and gray

nodes of the quadtree, respectively. The quadtree is traversed in pre-order.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of N lines containing each a comma-separated list of either:

a) (x, y) position of a pixel adjacent horizontally by black pixels, or

b) (xi  xf , y), where xf > xi: a sequence of white pixels at row y surrounded by black pixels.

The following holds: 1  x, xi, xf , y  L. Traverse the binary image from left to right, top to
bottom.

If L is not a power of 2, the output should display the text Invalid length, instead.
