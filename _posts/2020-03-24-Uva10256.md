title: Uva 10256  The Great Divide
---


## Input

```
Somewhere in Gaul, there is a little village very like the village where Asterix and Obelix live. Not
very long ago they had only one chief Altruistix and peace reigned in the village. But now those happy
days are just dreams. The villagers are now divided. Some of the villagers have elected Majestix as
their chief and the others have elected Cleverdix.

Majestix Cleverdix

The two chiefs have decided to divide the village into two parts by digging a straight ditch through
the middle of the village so that the houses of the supporters of Majestix lie on one part and those
of the followers of Cleverdix lie on the other. So, they have invited Getafix, the venerable druid of
Asterixs village, to figure out whether such a dividing line exists or not.

Getafix

Since Getafix knows that you are so good in programming, he seeks your help.
```

## Output

```
The input may contain multiple test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers M and C (1  M,C  500), indicating the

number of houses of the supporters of Majestix and Cleverdix respectively.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10256  The Great Divide 2/2

Each of the next M lines contains two integers x and y (1000  x, y  1000) giving the co-ordinates
of the house of a supporter of Majestix. For convenience each house is considered as a single point on
the plane.

Each of the next C lines contains two integers x and y (1000  x, y  1000) giving the co-ordinates
of the house of a supporter of Cleverdix.

The input will terminate with two zeros for M and C.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input output a line containing either Yes or No depending on whether there
exists a straight line that divides the two set of houses. The dividing line can NOT contain points of
both sides.
