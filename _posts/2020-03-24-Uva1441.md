title: Uva 01441  Accountant notes
---


## Input

```

You had an accountant, who recorded all your expenses. Each day you sent her notes on expenses and
she appended them to a single big summary file. Each of your notes consisted of several rows, like the
following:

bed = 100

table = 150

furniture = bed + table

furniture = furniture + 10

which (probably) meant that you spent 250 on furniture and 10 on transport (probably). More generally,
each row in your note was one of the following:

name = number
name = item + item

where item was either number or name, number was a natural number not exceeding 109 (with no
leading zeroes) and name was an arbitrary sequence of small and capital letters.

While transferring your notes to the summary file, the accountant neither changed the order of
rows of a note nor shuffled rows of difflerent notes. But sometimes she changed names. . . She did it
consistently though, changing all occurrences of the name in a single note to the same new one. Also,
different names from the same note were rewritten as different names in the summary file. But there is
no guarantee that it was consistent with your other notes  the name beer from one note could have
been rewritten as drink, the name tee from the other note could have been rewritten as drink as well,
while the beer from the next note could have been rewritten as food. Lets call her version of your note
a transcription of it.

The problem is that your accountant has just quit (and, as it turned out, took most of your savings)
and you are left with the summary file and a huge unsorted pile of notes. You want to check if it is
possible that some of your notes were not recorded in the summary, so for each note you are searching
for a piece of summary that can be its transcription.

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input contains a positive integer Z  15,
denoting the number of test cases. Then Z test cases follow, each conforming to the format described
below.

The first line of an input instance contains an integer k, the number of notes (1  k  50000). The
following lines first contain the descriptions of k notes, then the description of the summary file follows.
The description of each note and the summary starts with a line consisting of a single integer d (1  d).
Then d lines follow, each containing a single row of a note or the summary. The format of each row is
as described in the problem statement above. You can assume that names, numbers, signs = and +
are separated by single spaces and each line is at most 100 characters long. Both the length of the text
and the sum of all patterns lengths will be at most 3  106.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, your program has to write an output conforming to the format described below.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1441  Accountant notes 2/2

The output for a single instance should consist of k lines. In the i-th line there should be the
answer for the i-th note. It should be the number of the first row in the summary file, where a possible
transcription of the i-th note starts (the first row of the summary file has number 1) or word NONE if
no fragment of the summary file could be such possible transcription.
