title: Uva 10846  Reading time from a clock
---


## Input

```
It is the 23rd century. Humans have finally colonized several nearby solar systems and dwell happily
in their planets. Space travel is anyway very expensive and most inhabitants of extraterrestrial planets
never again leave the surface of their planet in their lifetimes. Thus, upon arrival to an uninhabited
planet, the colonizers adjusted the traditional Earth system of keeping track of time to the specific
situation of that planet, in a way it would be practical for that planet and at the same time similar to
what they were accustomed to.

In most planets, colonizers split the duration of a day into m hours (of duration similar to that of
Earths hours) and split each of those hours into n minutes. They read time from clocks in which the
hour-hand moves continuously at a steady rate of one revolution per day, and the minute-hand moves
continuously at a steady rate of one revolution per hour; the day begins at 0h : 0min at which time
both hands are pointing upwards.

An interstellar clock manufacturer came up with a revolutionary clock design in which both the
hour-hand and the minute-hand are the same size! They figured you could anyway tell the correct
time from the clock. For instance, assume that in a 12-hour clock (like those on Earth) one of the
hands is pointing upwards (to the 12) and the other hand is pointing to the 3: we can be sure it
is 3 o&rsquo;clock because it is impossible that the hour-hand is exactly pointing to the 12 and the
minute-hand is not also pointing to the 12. Therefore we know it is the hour-hand that is pointing to
the 3 and from this we can tell the time.

However, users from some planets soon complained they were having trouble telling the time from
certain positions of the hands. The clock manufacturer has hired you to write a program to determine
how many times during a certain time period confusion may arise from the position of the clock hands.

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains three positive integers m, n
and nq, where m and n represent the number of hours in a day and the number of minutes in an hour
for a certain planet, and nq is the number of queries that follow. You may assume m,n, nq  1000.
Each query is contained in a separate line and contains two times of the day, t1 and t2, separated by a
space. Each time of the day is given in the following format:

h:min num/den

where h is the hours, min is the minutes and num/den is a fraction < 1 which corresponds to a fraction
of a minute. For example, in Earth time, 3:30 1/2 would correspond to 3 hours, thirty minutes and
30 seconds (half a minute). You may assume that 0  h < m, 0  min < n, 0  num, den  1000 and
that t1  t2 (this means that, within a day, t1 does not happen after t2).

Input is terminated when m = n = nq = 0, this case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print the header Planet i:, without quotes, where i indicates the test case number
(beginning from 1) and then print, for each query, a line with a non-negative integer indicating the
number of occasions in which confusion may arise from the position of the clock hands during the time
interval (t1, t2]. If there are an infinite number of such occasions, print Infinity, without quotes,
instead of a number. Separate output from different test cases by a blank line.
