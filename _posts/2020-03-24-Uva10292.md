title: Uva 10292  The Gossiping System
---


## Input

```text
A common amusement in almost any society, though certainly not the most glamorous one, is for its
inhabitants to spread rumours about each other. In the town of Knoxville, this is definitely known to
be the case. In order to establish some sort of order without completely ruin the pleasure of gossiping,
they have agreed on a system for everyday life activities, in which rumours spread in a controlled
fashion. The inhabitants meet in certain groups in their work, as well as in their spare time, on a daily
basis. The following three criteria are met for their system:

1. Each group must have the same non-zero number of members m.

2. Each person must belong to the same number of groups r, as any other person.

3. Each pair of different groups has exactly one member in common.

We say that a (n, g,m, r)gossiping system is such a system consisting of n persons divided into g
groups, with m and r as above. The beauty of these systems lies in their uniformity. The construction
seems fair to everyone, and still all meetings are held in small groups. Since any two groups have a
member in common, information about the activities and people in one group is swiftly transferred to
all the other groups. Furthermore, it is easy for a messenger to lie if he or she would like to, since the
truth is hard to validate due to the fact that no two persons share more than one group. Unfortunately,
there are several combinations of n, g and m for which these systems do not exist!

As a mathematician living in Knoxville, you are interested in studying the existence conditions for
these systems for large values of n. However, you soon realise the complexity of these combinatorial
objects, and choose to study only their simplest non-trivial class, the (n, g,m, 2)gossiping systems.

## Output

```text
On the first line of input, is a single positive integer t. Thereafter t test cases follow. Each test case
consists of one positive number n, 1 < n < 1050, given in the standard base 10 representation, where n
specifies the number of persons.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input, output the text Yes. on a line of its own, if there exists a (n, g,m, 2)
gossiping system for any positive integers g > 1 and m > 0 for the value of n in the test case, otherwise
output the text No..
