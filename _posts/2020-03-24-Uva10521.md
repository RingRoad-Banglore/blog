## Input

```text
Though many programming languages dont support Recursion, it is still very important topic in
programming theories. I think the idea of Recursion came from the iterative process which is
playing a major role in the chapters of Numerical Methods!

Now lets see its application in number theory especially in the field of Continued Fractions (CF).
The origin of continued fractions is very difficult to pinpoint as we can find examples of these

fractions throughout mathematics in the last 2000 years, but its true foundations were not laid until
the late 1600s, early 1700s. But traditionally its origin is said to be occurred at the time of the
great geometrician Euclid. For more than a thousand years, any work that used continued fractions
was restricted to specific examples. The Indian mathematician Aryabhata used a continued fraction to
solve a linear indeterminate equation.

Throughout the history of Greek and Arab mathematical writings we can also find examples and
traces of continued fractions. But its use was also limited to specifics.

A formal definition of CF:
An expression of the form

a0 +
b0

a1 +
b1

a2+
b2

a3+
b3

...
is said to be a continued fraction. The values of a1,a2, a3, and b1, b2, b3, can be either real or
complex values. There can be either an infinite or a finite number of terms. A continued fraction can
be created from any number alpha by using the following recursive algorithm.

ai = i

i+1 =
1

i  ai
where 1 = alpha. The sequences of ais are the terms of the continued fraction.

There are four kinds of continued fractions. Infinite, where the terms just go on for ever, and finite
continued fraction, where there are only a fixed number of terms. And those two can be of one of two
types, regular (sometimes called simple), and irregular (sometimes called complex). The regular type
always has a one in the numerator. The irregular type can have other whole numbers there.

Here we are talking about the regular finite continued fraction that can be said as:
A continued fraction is an expression of the form,

A = a0 +
1

c0

where

c0 = a1 +
1

c1

c1 = a2 +
1

c2
...

...

If the process stopped at, say,

cn = an+1 +
1

cn+1

then we would have regular a finite continued fraction.

Now for any fraction of the form P
Q

(P and Q are whole numbers) expressing it in the form of a
regular finite continued fraction as follows:

P

Q
= a+

1

b+ 1
c+ 1

d+ 1

...

= a+ 1/(b+ 1/(c+ 1/(d+ . . .))) = a+
1

b+

1

c+

1

d+ . . .

where a, b, c, d, e, etc are all whole numbers.
```

## Output

```text
In every line of input you are given the integers P and Q. There may be at most 2000 digits in both
P and Q.

```

## Sample Input

```text
As output you have to present the regular finite continued fraction of P/Q in the following format.

P/Q = a+1/{b+1/{c+1/{d+. . .}}}

```
