## Input

```text
A long string does not look so long if we can identify a few short substrings that were used (possibly
more than once) in some permutation to construct the longer string. Your task is to find if a given
(long) string can be made up by choosing some (shorter) strings from a given collection.

You should note that:

a. All the strings are composed of ASCII characters in the range 33 to 127.

b. Any of the short strings or their reversed forms can be used any number of times to construct the
long string

c. Each use of a short string or its reverse would be counted as one occurance of that short string

When you construct the longer string from these short strings you should ensure that it is done by
keeping the total occurances of the short strings minimum.

For example, if we want to construct the string aabbabbabbbb from the set {a,bb,abb},
there can be many ways to achieve the goal. a-abb-abb-abb-bb and a-abb-a-bba-bb-bb are two
such valid constructions. However, we would prefer a-abb-abb-abb-bb (5 substrings) over a-abb-a-
bba-bb-bb (6 substrings) because it uses lesser number of substrings. You would only need to find the
minimum number of substrings that could be used to construct the given string.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the the input contains S (S < 51), the number of data set. Then S number of data
set follows. First line of each data set contains the long string, P (0 < length(P ) < 10001). The next
line contains the number of short strings, N (0 < N < 51) to choose from. Each of the next N lines
contain the short string Pi (0 < length(Pi) < 101) [i  1, 2, 3 . . . N ]. You can safely assume that there
is no blank/empty line in the input file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each data set print exactly one line of output.

Either Set S: C.
Or Set S: Not possible.
If it is possible to construct the string using the given strings then print the first line otherwise

print the second line. Here S is the serial of data set (sequentially from 1 to S) and C is the minimum
number of times the substrings were used to construct P . For clarification see sample output below.
