title: Uva 12842  The Courier Problem
---


## Input

```text
Here is a pretty problem which has been the source of much confusion in the past due to unfortunate
misunderstandings while defning its terms.

The courier galloping around the army

The ancient version which appears in old mathemat-
ical works goes something like this: A courier starting
from the rear of a moving army, ffty miles long, dashes
forward and delivers a dispatch to the front and returns
to his position in the rear, during the exact time it re-
quired the entire army to advance just ffty miles. How
far did the courier have to travel in delivering the dis-
patch, and returning to the rear of the army?

Now, for the general problem: Consider an army
L miles long, marching forward at constant speed. A
courier starts from the rear of the army, travels all the
way to the front, and immediately goes back to the rear
of the army, reaching his fnal destination at the precise moment when the army has covered a distance
of exactly L miles. Assume that the courier also moves with constant speed, and that the time he
spends on the front delivering the dispatch is negligible.

Write a program that, given the value L, calculates the total distance traveled by the courier, in
miles.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases.

Each test case is described by a single integer L, in its own line.

T  3000; 1  L  105

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the total distance covered by the courier. Print
this result as a real number, with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1
50
