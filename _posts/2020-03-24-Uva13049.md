title: Uva 13049  Combination Lock
---


## Input

```text
We are in desperate need of expert hands  hands
that can open combination locks in a flash. We al-
ready know the initial and target state of the lock,
but we need someone who can turn the wheels using
the smallest number of steps needed to open the locks
fast.

A multi-wheel combination lock has multiple
wheels that one can turn either clockwise or counter
clockwise to pick a digit from 0 to 9. The digits wrap
around, so you get digits 0 right after you cross 9 in a
clockwise fashion. Similarly, you get 9 after you cross
0 in a counter clockwise fashion.

Given the number of wheels on a combination
lock, its initial state and the target state, you need to
find out the minimum number of steps needed to go
from the initial state to the target state. For every
change in a digit on a wheel, we will count one step.
For example, for a 4 wheel combination lock if we are
given the initial configuration 1234 and we want to
get to 2546 we need at least 7 steps (1 step to go
from 1 to 2, 3 steps to go from 2 to 5, 1 step to go from 3 to 4 and 2 steps to go from 4 to 6).
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input will contain an integer T (1  T  200), the number of test cases. Each of the
following T lines will give you n, initial, and target. Here n (1  n  100) is an integer specifying the
number of wheels in the combination lock. The numeric strings initial and target denotes the initial
and target states of the lock. The length of both strings will be exactly n and they will only contain
decimal digits.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, print the case number as Case X: Y  where X is the case number (starting
from 1) followed by Y , the minimum number of steps needed to go from the initial configuration to the
target configuration. Check sample input and output for details.
