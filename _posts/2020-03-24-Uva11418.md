```
Piotr is organizing a programming competition consisting of n problems, numbered A, B, C, etc. He
wants to name the first problem starting with the letter A, the second problem starting with the letter
B, and so on. However, he cannot simply come up with random words for problem titles  that
wouldnt make sense. For each problem, he has come up with a list of acceptable names. Help Piotr
pick an ordering of the problems and an acceptable name for each one so that each problems name
starts with the correct letter of the alphabet.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with n on a
line by itself. The next n lines list the possible names for each of the n problems. Each line starts with
ki  the number of acceptable names for problem i and lists the names, separated by spaces. Each
name is a non-empty string of letters. No two names will be the same, and no two names for the same
problem will start with the same letter.
1  N  30,
1  n  26,
1  ki  26.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, first output the line Case #x:, where x is the test case number. After that, print
n lines listing the n problem names, each with only the first letter capitalized. There is guaranteed to
be exactly one solution.
