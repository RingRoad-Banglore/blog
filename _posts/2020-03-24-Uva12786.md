title: Uva 12786  Friendship Networks
---


## Input

```text

For a group of N people registered at a social network, a friendship network can be constructed with
the N people as the nodes and a non-directed edge between every pair of friends. For such a network,
it is usual to say that a node, i.e., a person, has degree d iff there are d nodes connected to it. Note that
the degree of a node is exactly his/her number of friends. Since nobody is friends with himself/herself,
the degree of each node is less than N .

A key property of a friendship network is the number of friends for each one of its members, i.e., its
members degrees. However, given an intended number of network friends for each one of the members,
such a network may or may not exist. For example, for a group of 4 people there is a friendship network
in which the people have 3, 2, 2, and 3 friends. However, there is no friendship network corresponding
to the enumeration 1, 3, 2, and 3 for a group of 4 people.

You are working at a company that researches friendship networks with the business idea of eventu-
ally developing applications on them. Your specific job is part of a test data validation. More precisely,
you must write a program that given an enumeration of positive integers, decides if there exists a
friendship network with such number of friends for each of its members.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several cases. Each test case is given in a single line by a blank-separated list of
integers N, d1, d2, . . . , dN , with N (2  N  1000) the number of people in the social network and the
di (1  i  N) an enumeration of a possible friendship network. You can assume that 0 < di < N for
1  i  N .

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output a single line for each test case. If d1, d2, . . . , dN describes a friendship network with such number
of friends for each of its members, then output 1; otherwise output 0.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4 3 2 2 3

4 1 3 2 3

8 2 5 4 5 4 3 5 2
