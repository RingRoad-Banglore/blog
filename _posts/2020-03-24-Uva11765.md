```
In circuit design, component placement is an important step in the design automation. Inferior place-
ments may affect the performance and manufacturing cost.

You are given a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). Its a large green board. You can place components
on either side of the PCB. However, cost of placing a component on both sides are not the same. You
are given N components. For each component ci, cost of placing it on the top layer is Xi and on the
bottom layer is Yi.

These components may interact with each other. If both the components are on the same side of
the PCB, the interconnection cost is negligible. But, if they are on different sides, their interconnection
is costly. For each such interconnection j, the cost will be Zj .

Finally, some design issues restricts some components to be on the top side or bottom side. Now,
find the minimum cost to place the components.
```

## Input

```
First line contains a positive integer T (T  50) that denotes the number of test cases.

Each test case starts with 2 integers N (1  N  200) and M (0  M  100000, M  N(N1)/2),
the number of components and number of interconnections. This will be followed by N integers in a line,
each between 1 and 10000000 (inclusive), where i-th of it describes the cost of placing the component
on the top layer. The next line contains N more integers, each between 1 and 10000000 (inclusive),
where i-th of it denotes the cost of placing it on the bottom layer. The next line contains N more
integers, each will be either 0, -1 or +1, where

 -1 means i-th component can only be placed on the bottom

 +1 means i-th component can only be placed on the top

 0 means the component can be placed on either side

Then there will be M lines, each containing three integers, p, q, and r (1  p, q  N , 1  r 
10000000), denoting that, p and q-th component has to be interconnected and if they are on different
layers, the cost of interconnection will be r. There will be at most one interconnection between any
pair or components.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the minimum cost to place the components.
