title: Uva 13235  Graph Cut of Maximum XOR Weight
---


```
A cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets. Any cut creates a cut-set, the
set of edges that have one endpoint in each subset of the partition. Let V (cutset) denote the XOR of
all the weights on all the edges in the cut-set. In this problem you will start with an empty graph with
n nodes. A number of weighted edges will be successively added to the graph. After the addition of
each weighted edge, output the value of the maximum XOR cut, such that V (cut set) is maximized!
```

## Input

```
A number of of inputs ( 100) with the following format:

The first two integers n, m represent the number of points in the graph and the total number of
edges to be added successively. Next, we have m lines, with x, y, w where (x, y) is the undirected edge
of weight w. w will be given in binary form listed from the highest binary bit to lowest binary bit.

Note that 1  n  500, 1  m  1000, 0  length(w)  1000, 1  x, y  n.

```

## Output

```
For each edge, output the value of the maximum XOR cut in binary form (from high bit to low bit).
