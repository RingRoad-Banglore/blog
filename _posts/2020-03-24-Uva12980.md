title: Uva 12980  Keypad Problem
---


```
Back in the Moscow artisan market, Mr. Ed bought an antique calculator which he really wanted to
show to his pals. When he came back, he noticed that the keypad of the calculator is incredibly strange!

Instead of having the usual keys from 0 to 9, this weird calculator has n different numeric keys and
three extra keys with the operators + (plus), - (minus) and = (equals). The i-th key has a number
ki labeled on it, meaning that by pressing this key, the number ki is showed on the calculators screen.
If there is some other number currently displayed on the screen, it is replaced by ki.

As you may notice, this is pretty impractical, but Mr. Ed is clever and knows that in order to
display a number not labeled in the keypad, he can make some additions and subtractions of the
available numbers. For example, suppose Mr. Ed wants to display the number 7 and the available
numeric keys of the keypad are 1, 3 and 5. Our friend could press the third key (with label 5), then
press the + key (to add another number) followed by the second key (adding 3), press the - and first
key (in order to subtract 1) and finally get the result of the operations by pressing the = key, summing
up the number 7.

Mr. Ed wants to display the number r in the calculators screen, but he is not even sure he can
achieve that. Please write a program that tells Mr. Ed if he can display number r and, in case it is
possible, shows how to add up r by pressing several keys of the keypad.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases (up to 100). The first line of each test contains 2 integers n
and r: the number of numeric keys in the keypad and the integer Mr. Ed wants to display (1  n  50
and 1  |r|  1018). The next line contains n integers; the i-th integer represents the number ki labeled
in the i-th numeric key (1  ki  20, 000). There will be no two keys with the same ki.

The last test case is followed by a single line containing 2 zeroes.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, if it is impossible to display number r print Stupid keypad! If Mr. Ed can
display r, print n integers: the i-th integer represents how many times you need to add (if the number
is positive) or subtract (if the number is negative) number ki in order to display r. See format below
for details.

Please notice Mr. Ed can press a single key as many times as he like, possibly leading to multiple
correct solutions. Any correct solution you print will be accepted.

```

## Sample Input

```
3 7
1 3 5
1 3
6
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case #1: -1 1 1
Case #2: Stupid keypad!
```
