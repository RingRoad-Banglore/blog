```
Given the value of an n you will have to find the modulo 100000000 value of the following expression:



1+ 


3+ 


5+ . . .+ 


2i 1+ . . .+ 


m,

where m is the largest odd number not greater than n.
Or in other words you will have to find the value of S where,

S = (

1+ 


3+ 


5+ . . .+ 


m) mod 100000000
```

## Input

The input file contains at most 30000 lines of inputs. Each line contains a single 64-nit signed integer
which denotes the value of n. Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero which should not
be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the value of S.
