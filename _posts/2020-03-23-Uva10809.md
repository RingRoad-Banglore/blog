10809 Great Circle
Airplanes fly close to the
Great Circle Route between
two cities. The Great Circle
Route is the shortest arc con-
centric with the earth that
joins the two cities; that is,
the shortest distance between
the two cities following the
surface of the earth.

Given the latitude and
longitude of two cities, find
the most northerly latitude
reached on the Great Cir-
cle Route between the cities.
Print "undefined" if there is
no unique answer.

## Input
The first line of input contains N , the number of test cases. N lines follow, one for each case, containing
the latitude and longitude of the two cities, in degrees, minutes, and direction. [A minute is 1/60 degree;
Points on the equator have latitude denoted 0,0N (not 0,0S); points on the poles have longitude denoted
0,0W; points with 180 degrees longitude are denoted 180,0W (not 180,0E).]

## Output
For each case your program should produce one line of output giving the most northerly latitude
reached, in the given format. Round your answer to the nearest minute.

## Sample Input
<p>3</p><p>50,13N 45,10W 75,0N 44,50E</p><p>50,13N 90,10W 75,0N 89,50E</p><p>10,0N 129,30E 10,0S 50,30W</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>75,41N</p><p>90,0N</p><p>undefined</p>
