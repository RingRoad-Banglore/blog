title: Uva 10926  How Many Dependencies
---


## Input

```
In this problem you will need to find out which task has the most number of dependencies. A task A
depends on another task B if B is a direct or indirect dependency of A.

For example, if A depends on B and B depends on C, then A has two dependencies, one direct and
one indirect.

You can assume there will be no cyclic dependencies in the input.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of a set of scenarios. Each scenario begins with one integer N , 0 < N  100, in a
line indicating how many tasks this scenario contains. Then there will be N lines, one for each task.
Each line will contain an integer 0  T  N  1, the number of direct dependencies of that task, plus
T integers, the identifiers of that dependencies. Tasks are numbered from 1 to N .

The input ends with a scenario where N = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each scenario, print the number of the task with the greatest number of dependencies alone in a
line. If there are ties, show the task with the lowest identifier.

```

## Sample Output

```
