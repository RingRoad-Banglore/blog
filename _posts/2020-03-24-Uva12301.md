title: Uva 12301  An Angular Puzzle
---


## Input

```text
Here is an old interesting puzzle: In the picture below, what is the angle of DEA, in degrees? Note
that 5 angles are already given. The picture is drawn to scale.

Youre to solve a generalized problem: let a, b, c, d, e be the
angle of ACB, CAE, EAB, CBD, DBA (in degrees), what is the
angle of DEA, in degrees?

Note that E must be strictly on segment BC (cannot coincide
with B or C), and D must be strictly on segment AC (cannot co-
incide with A or C). The triangle ABC must be non-degenerated
(i.e. ABC cannot be collinear). Not all combination of parame-
ters a, b, c, d and e corresponds to a valid figure described above.
Your program should be able to detect this.
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each case contains 5 integers
a, b, c, d, e (0 < a, b, c, d, e < 90). The last test case is followed
by five zeros, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the answer to two decimal places. If
there is more than one solution, print Multiple solutions.
If the input is incorrect (i.e. there is no valid picture for these
parameters), print Impossible (without quotes).

```

## Sample Output

```text
20 10 70 20 60
30 5 70 15 60
60 30 30 30 30
30 40 40 40 40
0 0 0 0 0

```
