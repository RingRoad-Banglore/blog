title: Uva 11280  Flying to Fredericton

## Input

```text
After being inspired by Salvador Dalis artwork, Brett decided he would like to travel to Fredericton,
New Brunswick to visit the Beaverbrook Art Gallery.

Brett lives in Calgary, and would like to find the cheapest flight or flights that would take him to
Fredericton. He knows that a direct flight from Calgary to Fredericton, if one exists, would be absurdly
expensive, so he is willing to tolerate a certain number of stopovers. However, there are multiple airlines
in Canada with so many different flights between different cities now, which makes it very difficult for
Brett to find the least expensive way to Fredericton! Can you write a program to help Brett plan his
route?

Map showing a sample of the flights that would take Brett to Fredericton.

You will be given a list of cities between and including Calgary and Fredericton. The cities will
be given in order of nearest to farthest. The first city will always be Calgary and the last
Fredericton.

You will also be given a list of flights between pairs of cities, and the associated cost for each flight,
taxes included. There will never be a flight from a farther city to a nearer city - Brett has already
discarded those flights, deeming them to be a waste of time and money. Bear in mind, however, that
there may be more than one flight between any two cities, as Brett is considering flights from all airlines.

Finally, you are presented with a number of queries. Each query is a single integer indicating the
maximum number of stopovers Brett will tolerate. For each query, your program must calculate the
least total cost of flights that would take Brett from Calgary to Fredericton with no more than the
requested number of stopovers.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains a single number indicating the number of scenarios to process. A blank
line precedes each scenario.

Each scenario begins with a number N (2  N  100), the number of cities, followed by N lines
containing the names of the cities. A city name is a string of up to 20 uppercase and lowercase letters.
Next is a number M (0  M  1000), the number of flights available, followed by M lines describing
the flights. Each flight is described by its departure city, its destination city, and an integer representing
its cost in dollars. The final line starts with Q (1  Q  10), the number of queries, followed by Q
numbers indicating the maximum number of stopovers.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each scenario, your program should output the scenario number, followed by the least total cost of
the flights for each query. Follow the format of the sample output. If no flights can satisfy a query,
write No satisfactory flights. Output a blank line between scenarios.
