## Input

```text
Different types of electoral systems exist. In a block voting system the members of a party do not
vote individually as they like, but instead they must collectively accept or reject a proposal. Although
a party with many votes clearly has more power than a party with few votes, the votes of a small
party can nevertheless be crucial when they are needed to obtain a majority. Consider for example the
following five-party system:

party votes
A 7
B 4
C 2
D 6
E 6

Coalition {A,B} has 7 + 4 = 11 votes, which is not a majority. When party C joins coalition {A,B},
however, {A,B,C} becomes a winning coalition with 7+4+2 = 13 votes. So even though C is a small
party, it can play an important role.

As a measure of a partys power in a block voting system, John F. Banzhaf III proposed to use the
power index. The key idea is that a partys power is determined by the number of minority coalitions
that it can join and turn into a (winning) majority coalition. Note that the empty coalition is also a
minority coalition and that a coalition only forms a majority when it has more than half of the total
number of votes. In the example just given, a majority coalition must have at least 13 votes.

In an ideal system, a partys power index is proportional to the number of members of that party.
Your task is to write a program that, given an input as shown above, computes for each party its

power index.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains a single integer which equals the number of test cases that follow. Each of the
following lines contains one test case.

The first number on a line contains an integer P in [1 . . . 20] which equals the number of parties for
that test case. This integer is followed by P positive integers, separated by spaces. Each of these integers
represents the number of members of a party in the electoral system. The i-th number represents party
number i. No electoral system has more than 1000 votes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, you must generate P lines of output, followed by one empty line. P is the number
of parties for the test case in question. The i-th line (i in [1 . . . P ]) contains the sentence:
party i has power index I
where I is the power index of party i.

```
