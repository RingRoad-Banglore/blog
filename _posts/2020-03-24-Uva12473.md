title: Uva 12473  Common Palindrome
---


```
A palindrome is a string that reads the same from the left as it does from the right. Given two strings
A and B, you need to find the length of longest palindrome which is a subsequence of both A and B.
A subsequence is a sequence obtained by deleting zero or more characters from a string.

For example, say, A = cfcfaafc, B = efagfc. Then the longest palindrome which is a subse-
quence of both A and B is faf. So the answer is 3.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T  100). Each of the following T cases consists
of 2 lines. These 2 lines contain the strings A and B, respectively. Length of A and B will not be more
than 60. All these strings contain only lowercase letters (a -z). No empty strings will appear in the
input.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print a line of the form Case < x >: < y >, where x is the case number and y is the
length of the longest common palindromic subsequence.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
cfcfaafc
efagfc
afbcdfca
bcadfcgyfka
palin
drome

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 5
Case 3: 0
```
