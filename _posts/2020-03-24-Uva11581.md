## Input

```
Consider a 3 3 grid of numbers g where each cell contains either a 0
or a 1. We define a function f that transforms such a grid: each cell
of the grid f(g) is the sum (modulo 2) of its adjacent cells in g (two
cells are considered adjacent if and only if they share a common side).

Furthermore, we define f (i)(g) recursively f (0)(g) = g and
f (i+1)(g) = f(f (i)(g)) (where i  0). Finally, for any grid h, let kg(h) be
the number of indices i such that h = f (i)(g) (we may have kg(h) = ).
Given a grid g, your task is to compute the greatest index i such that
kg(f

(i)(g)) is finite.
```

## Output

```
Input begins with the number of test cases on its own line. Each case consists of a blank line followed
by three lines of three characters, each either 1 or 0. The jth character of the ith row of the test
case is the value in the jth cell of the ith row of the grid g.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the greatest index i such that kg(f (i)(g)) is finite.
If there is no such index, output -1.
