title: Uva 12190  Electric Bill
---


## Input

```
Its year 2100. Electricity has become very expensive. Recently, your electricity company raised the
power rates once more. The table below shows the new rates (consumption is always a positive integer):

Range Price
(Crazy-Watt-hour) (Americus)

1  100 2
101  10000 3

10001  1000000 5
> 1000000 7

This means that, when calculating the amount to pay, the first 100 CWh have a price of 2 Americus
each; the next 9900 CWh (between 101 and 10000) have a price of 3 Americus each and so on.

For instance, if you consume 10123 CWh you will have to pay 2 100+ 3 9900+ 5 123 = 30515
Americus.

The evil mathematicians from the company have found a way to gain even more money. Instead of
telling you how much energy you have consumed and how much you have to pay, they will show you
two numbers related to yourself and to a random neighbor:

A: the total amount to pay if your consumptions were billed together; and

B: the absolute value of the difference between the amounts of your bills.

If you cant figure out how much you have to pay, you must pay another 100 Americus for such
a service. You are very economical, and therefore you are sure you cannot possibly consume more
than any of your neighbors. So, being smart, you know you can compute how much you have to pay.
For example, suppose the company informed you the following two numbers: A = 1100 and B = 300.
Then you and your neighbors consumptions had to be 150 CWh and 250 CWh respectively. The total
consumption is 400 CWh and then A is 2100+3300 = 1100. You have to pay 2100+350 = 350
Americus, while your neighbor must pay 2 100 + 3 150 = 650 Americus, so B is |350 650| = 300.

Not willing to pay the additional fee, you decided to write a computer program to find out how
much you have to pay.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed of a single line, containing two integers
A and B, separated by a single space, representing the numbers shown to you (1  A,B  109). You
may assume there is always a unique solution, that is, there exists exactly one pair of consumptions
that produces those numbers.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros separated by a single space.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input, your program must print a single line containing one integer, representing
the amount you have to pay.
