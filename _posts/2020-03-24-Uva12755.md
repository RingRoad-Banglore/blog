```

We know that the 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle where there are numbered tiles in no particular order and
only one square is empty. In each move, we can slide one adjacent tile to the empty space. Thus we
need to place all the tiles in order. An example of initial state and goal state is shown here.

Here, we are considering an easier version of the puzzle. In each move, any tile can be moved to the
empty space, i.e. the adjacency is not required. In other words, we are allowed to swap the position of
any tile with the empty space in one move. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of moves to
solve the puzzle for a N N board.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains a positive integer T (T < 100). Then T cases follow, where the first line
of each case contains a positive integer N (2  N  500). Then each of the following N lines contains
N space separated integers denoting a row of the puzzle. The empty square is denoted by 0. Each
integer from 0 to N2  1 (inclusive) will be present exactly once.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print Case X: Y  in a separate line, whereX is the case number and Y is the minimum
number of moves to solve the puzzle.
