title: Uva 12000  KTransformed Permutations
---


## Input

```
Consider a sequence of n integers < 1 2 3 4 . . . n >. Since all the values are distinct, we know that
there are n factorial permutations. A permutation is called K-transformed if the absolute difference
between the original position and the new position of every element is at most K.

Given n and K, you have to find out the total number of K-transformed permutations.

Example: n = 4, K = 2

1 2 3 4 Valid Annotation
(position)

P1 1 2 3 4 Yes The original sequence. All the elements are in their original position
P2 1 2 4 3 Yes 3 and 4 are reordered, but each is shifted by 1 position only.
P3 1 3 2 4 Yes
P4 1 3 4 2 Yes 2 is shifted by 2 positions. 2  K, so its a valid one.
P5 1 4 2 3 Yes
P6 1 4 3 2 Yes
P7 2 1 3 4 Yes
P8 2 1 4 3 Yes
P9 2 3 1 4 Yes
P10 2 3 4 1 No 1 is shifted by 3 positions. 3 > K and so this is an invalid permutation
P11 2 4 1 3 Yes
P12 2 4 3 1 No
P13 3 1 2 4 Yes
P14 3 1 4 2 Yes
P15 3 2 1 4 Yes
P16 3 2 4 1 No
P17 3 4 1 2 Yes
P18 3 4 2 1 No
P19 4 1 2 3 No 4 is shifted by 3 positions. 3 > K and so this is also invalid
P20 4 1 3 2 No
P21 4 2 1 3 No
P22 4 2 3 1 No
P23 4 3 1 2 No
P24 4 3 2 1 No Here, both 4 and 1 are breaking the property.

So, for the above case, there are 14 2-transformed permutations.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 20) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
consists of a line containing two integers n and K. (1  n  109) and (0  K  3).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the case number first followed by the required result. Since the result could be
huge, output result modulo 73405.
