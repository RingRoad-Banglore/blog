title: Uva 12931  Common Area
---


```
Given two simple polygons, your task is to determine whether they have a non-empty common area.
Note that the two rectangles in figure (a) share a segment, but no common area at all.

By simple polygon, we mean the polygons will not be self-intersecting or self-touching, and will
not have duplicated vertices or adjacent collinear segments.

Note: be sure to test your program with many special cases.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each test case contains two lines, one for each polygon. Each
polygon begins with an integer n (3  n  100), the number of vertices, then n pairs of integers (x, y)
(1000  x, y  1000), the vertices of the polygon, in counter-clockwise order.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and one of Yes or No.

```

## Sample Input

```
4 0 0 2 0 2 2 0 2
4 2 0 4 0 4 2 2 2
4 0 0 2 0 2 2 0 2
4 1 0 3 0 3 2 1 2

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: No
Case 2: Yes
```
