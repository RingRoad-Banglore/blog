title: Uva 00879  Circuit Nets
---


## Input

```
An electronic circuit consists of components, pins, and wires. Figure 1 shows a circuit with the three
components A, B, and C. Each wire connects a pair of pins. Two pins a and b are electrically
equivalent if they are either connected by a wire or there is a sequence a1, a2, , ak of pins such that
a, a1; a1, a2; ; ak1, ak; and ak, b are all connected by wires.

A net is a maximal set of electrically equivalent pins. Maximal means that no pin outside the net
is electrically equivalent to a pin in the net.

Given a set of pins and a set of wires your task is to determine the number of nets defined within the
circuit. The figure below illustrates the circuit with three nets described in the sample input section.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The sequence of pins is always numbered from 1 to N . The first input value is the value of N . The
sequence of wires is described by pairs of pin values. It is given at the input as sequence of numbers,
separated by a space. The first two numbers define the first pair, the two numbers that follow define
the second pair, and so on. The input ends with the end_of_file mark.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

The output is just the number of nets found.
