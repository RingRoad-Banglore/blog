title: Uva 12925  Race against the clock
---


```
We are going to simulate a competition of cycling among N participants against the clock, where each
participant leaves every X units of time, and must travel a distance D. The simulation is represented
by a string S with at most 300 characters. Each character represents the players movement at each
unit of time, that is, if the character Ci is 1, means that player 1 advanced at moment i (1  i  300).
For easiness, only one player will advance at a time. Player number 1 leaves at moment 1, player 2
leaves at moment 1 + X, player 3 leaves at moment 1 + 2X, and so on. If a player that hasnt left
appears, his movement must be ignored. A player finishes the race when appears at least D times after
leaving.

For example, the string 122121 with N = 2, X = 2 and D = 2, means that player 1 advances
one unit at time 1. The character number two must be ignored because the second player hasnt left,
but the third character is relevant because player 2 leaves at that moment and advances one unit. The
fourth character means that player one advances one more unit completing the distance D, so the time
for player 1 is 4. The fifth character is 2, so the player 2 also finishes the race and his time is 3 (he
finished when the total time was 5 but he left at moment 3, in other words, he was in race during
characters 3, 4 and 5  dont forget that this race is against the clock!). The last character could be
ignored.

The program should output the classification of the participants in accordance to the time registered
when they get to the finish line, but theres one restriction: the simulation is valid only if all players
have finished the race and travel times have been normally distributed with an index of asymmetry
lesser than 20%, which is defined as follows:

As =

3  (median)

```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each one contains an integer T , the number of
simulations (1  T  1000). Each simulation starts with 2 integers N (2  N  6) and D (1  D  10).
The next line contains the string S with length L, representing the stopwatch. It is granted that the
string only contains valid numbers, that is, 1  Si  N .

After that, there is a line that contains Q (1  Q  L
4
+ 1). The following line will contain Q

different values from X (1  X  L
4
+ 1), each one separated by an space.

```

## Output

```
If the arrival times of cyclists have been normally distributed, print the order of arrival, otherwise
display a message indicating that the simulation was invalid. Check the examples to see how to show
that. If two or more players have the same time, order by the players number.
