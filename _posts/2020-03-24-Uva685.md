title: Uva 00685  Least Path Cost
---


```
Given a positive integer  (0 <  < 10000), which is called the overhead, and M (0 < M  200)
straight line segments in a two-dimensional plane with the following properties:

1. each line segment has a height, which is a positive integer;

2. two line segments only intersect with each other on endpoints;

3. no two line segments are overlapped.

Each line has a unique number between 1 and M . Each endpoint in the plane has a unique number
between 1 and N (0 < N  400), where N is the total number of endpoints. A line segment is
represented by its two endpoints (ni, nj). Let height(L) be the height of a line segment L.

A path is a sequence of line segments LC1 , LC2, . . . , LCk , such that k > 1, Ci = Cj i = j, LCi
intersects with LCi+1 for all 1  i < k, one endpoint of LC1 does not intersect with any other line
segments, and one endpoint of LCk does not intersect with any other line segments. The cost between
two intersection line segments i LCi and LCi+1 isheight(LCi) height(LCi+1)

That is, for example you can image, the number of stairs that one has to climb (up or down ) by
walking from LCi to LCi+1 . The cost of a path LC1 , LC2, . . . , LCk is

cost(LCi , LCi+1).

Fig. 1: An example of 8 straight lines with 9 endpoints.

In the example shown in Fig.
1,  = 25, M = 8, and N =
9. Then cost(L2, L3) = 1 and
cost(L1, L6) = 8. L1, L4, L5 is
not a path. There are three paths
in the plane. The cost for the
path L1, L6, L7, L8 is 109. The cost
for the path L1, L4, L5, L8 is 131.
The cost for the path L2, L3 is 51.
Hence L2, L3 is the path with the
least cost.

You may also assume there is at
least one path in the plane. Write
a program to find the least cost
among all paths.

## Input

```
The first line is l, the number of test
cases. The first three lines of test
case #i are Mi, Ni and i which
are the numbers of line segments

and endpoints, and the overhead, respectively. The following Mi lines each contains the two endpoints
of each line segment, starting from L1 to LMi , and its height.

Each line segment is represented by three integers, separated by blanks.

```

## Output

```
Contains l lines. The i-th line contains the least cost of all paths in the i-th test case.
