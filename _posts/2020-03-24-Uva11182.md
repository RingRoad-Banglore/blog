title: Uva 11182  Zeroes III
---


## Input

```text
The factorial n! of a number n is defined as n!= 1  2  3  . . .  n.

The function F1(n) = 1!2!3! . . .  n!
And the function F2(n) = F1(1)  F1(2)  F1(3)  . . .  F1(n)
Given two numbers n and b your job is to find the number of trailing zeroes in F2(n) when expressed

in base b.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains around 2000 lines of inputs. Each line contains two integers n (1  n  1000000)
and b (2  b  10000). Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output which contains an integer Z, which denotes the number
of trailing zeroes in F2(n), when expressed in base b.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 3
4 2
0 0

```
