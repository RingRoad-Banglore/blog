title: Uva 00699  The Falling Leaves
---


## Input

```text
Each year, fall in the North Central region is accompanied by the brilliant colors of the leaves on the
trees, followed quickly by the falling leaves accumulating under the trees. If the same thing happened
to binary trees, how large would the piles of leaves become?

We assume each node in a binary tree drops a number of leaves equal to the integer value stored
in that node. We also assume that these leaves drop vertically to the ground (thankfully, theres no
wind to blow them around). Finally, we assume that the nodes are positioned horizontally in such a
manner that the left and right children of a node are exactly one unit to the left and one unit to the
right, respectively, of their parent. Consider the following tree on the right:

The nodes containing 5 and 6 have the same horizontal posi-
tion (with different vertical positions, of course). The node con-
taining 7 is one unit to the left of those containing 5 and 6, and
the node containing 3 is one unit to their right. When the leaves
drop from these nodes, three piles are created: the leftmost one
contains 7 leaves (from the leftmost node), the next contains 11
(from the nodes containing 5 and 6), and the rightmost pile con-
tains 3. (While it is true that only leaf nodes in a tree would
logically have leaves, we ignore that in this problem.)
```

## Output

```text
The input contains multiple test cases, each describing a single tree. A tree is specified by giving the
value in the root node, followed by the description of the left subtree, and then the description of the
right subtree. If a subtree is empty, the value -1 is supplied. Thus the tree shown above is specified
as 5 7 -1 6 -1 -1 3 -1 -1. Each actual tree node contains a positive, non-zero value. The last test
case is followed by a single -1 (which would otherwise represent an empty tree).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, display the case number (they are numbered sequentially, starting with 1) on a line
by itself. On the next line display the number of leaves in each pile, from left to right, with a single
space separating each value. This display must start in column 1, and will not exceed the width of an
80-character line. Follow the output for each case by a blank line. This format is illustrated in the
examples below.

```

## Sample Output

```text
5 7 -1 6 -1 -1 3 -1 -1
8 2 9 -1 -1 6 5 -1 -1 12 -1
-1 3 7 -1 -1 -1
-1

```
