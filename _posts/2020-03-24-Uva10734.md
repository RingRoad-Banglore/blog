title: Uva 10734  Triangle Partitioning
---


```
A triangle can be divided into two equal triangle by drawing a median on its largest edge (In the
figure below, or above such a division is shown with the red line). Then the smaller two triangles can
be divided in similar fashion into equal triangles (Shown in the picture below with blue lines). This
process can continue forever.

Some mathematicians have found that we have only some styles of triangles they only differs in
sizes when we split triangle into small ones in the method specified above. So now given the length of
the sides of the triangle your job is to find out how many different styles of small triangles do we have.
Two triangles are of same style when they are similar triangles.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 35) that indicates how many lines of inputs
are there.

Each line contains three integers a, b, c (0 < a, b, c < 100) which indicates the sides of a valid
triangle. A valid triangle means a real triangle with positive area.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input you should produce one line of output, which contains the serial of output
followed by an integer T , which indicates the number of different styles of small triangles, formed for
that particular triangle. Look at the output for sample input for details. You can safely assume that
for any triangle T will be less than 100.

## Sample Input

```
2
3 4 5
12 84 90

```

## Sample Output

```
Triangle 1: 3
Triangle 2: 41
