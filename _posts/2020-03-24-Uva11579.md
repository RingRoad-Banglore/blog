title: Uva 11579  Triangle Trouble
---


## Input

```text
These are also limited edition triangles
There is trouble at the triangle fac-
tory. The triangle assembler has gone
down, so all that has been produced
for the day is a bunch of triangle sides.
To make the best of this situation, it
has been decided to create the triangle
with the largest possible area from the
available sides, and sell it as a limited
edition triangle.

You have been hired to write a pro-
gram that will determine the area of
the limited edition triangle.
```

## Output

```text
Input begins with the number of test
cases on its own line. Each test case
begins with a positive integer N (3 
N  10, 000), followed by N posi-
tive real numbers si representing the
lengths of the available triangle sides
(0 < si  100, 000). A single test case
may be spread out over several consec-
utive lines of the input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing the largest possible area of a triangle built using three of
the given sides (as a real number rounded to 2 decimal places). If it is not possible to construct any
triangles then output 0.00 (quotes for clarity).

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
4 3.0 4.0 5.0 100.0
3 1.0 2.0 4.0
