```

Recycling involves processing used materials into new products in order to
prevent the waste of potentially useful materials.

Recycling materials include things like glass, paper, plastic, metal and
textiles. There are some materials that cant be recycled such as Aerosol Cans.
Aerosol cans that are not empty may leak or explode during the sorting and
baling processes of recycling.

You are given a list of materials to be recycled. The materials are initially
aligned in a line one after another. For every type of recyclable-material there
is a corresponding bin. You are required to place each recyclable-material in
its corresponding bin.

Example: paper  glass  paper  aerosol  paper

In the example above, there are two types of recyclable-materials (paper & glass) and one type of
non-recyclable-material. If we were to pick each material one by one and throw them in the bins, we
would require 4 moves since there are 4 recyclable-materials. However, if we remove consecutive items
in one move, provided they are of the same type, we could achieve the desired task in lesser number of
moves.

Lets see how this can be done: If we remove the glass first then the first two papers appear side by
side enabling them to be moved together in the next move. Then we just have one paper remaining at
the end and that requires a further move. This accumulates to a figure of 3 moves.

Illustration:
# Start : paper - glass - paper - aerosol - paper

# Move 1 : paper - paper - aerosol - paper [after removing glass]
# Move 2 : aerosol - paper [after removing first 2 papers]
# Move 3 : aerosol [after removing the last paper]

## Input

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 50) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case starts
with an integer N (N < 100). The next line contains the names of N materials. The name of each
material is a string containing only characters from the set [a..z] and [A..Z] and the length of each is
at most 20. A recyclable-material is represented by lowercase letters only and that of non-recyclable-
material by uppercase letters only.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the case number followed by the minimum number of moves required to clean up
all the recyclable-materials meeting the constraints mentioned above.
