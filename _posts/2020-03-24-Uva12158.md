title: Uva 12158  Irreducible Fractions

## Input

```text
A fraction is irreducible if its numerator and denominator dont have
any common factor greater than 1. For example 3

1
, 4

7
, 1

10
, 9

25
are all

irreducible fractions. But there are some fractions like
21n+ 10

14n+ 7

which is irreducible for any integer value of n. It is not quite straight-
forward to identify such fractions.

Now consider the fraction with general form,
an+ x

bn+ y

where a, b, x, y are always integers satisfying 0  x, y  107 and (0  a, b  32000, (a + b) > 0). If
values of a and b are given then we will be able to find some pair of values (x, y) such that for any
integer value of n, fraction an+x

bn+y
is irreducible.

One possible way of finding some of such pairs (x, y) is by using the theorem: If there exist
integers p and q such that rp+ sq = 1 (r and s are also integers), then r and s are relatively prime.

So if (an+ x) and (bn+ y) are relative prime then we can write

(an+ x)p+ (bn+ y)q = 1 = n(ap+ bq) + (px+ qy) = 1 (1)

The relation (1) above can hold for any value of n, if ap+ bq = 0 and px+ qy = 1. Given the value
of a and b your job is to count how many different (x, y) pairs there are such that there exist integers
p, q satisfying ap+ bq = 0 and px+ qy = 1.
```

## Output

```text
There can be up to 100000 lines of inputs. Each line contains two non-negative integers which denote
the value of a and b (0  a, b  32000, (a+ b) > 0) respectively.

Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes. These two zeroes need not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input except the last one, produce one line of output. This line contains an integer
P . This P denotes the total number of different pair of integer values for x and y, which ensures that
ap+ bq = 0 and px+ qy = 1, where (0  x, y  107).

```

## Sample Output

```text
100 223
2300 1000
0 0
