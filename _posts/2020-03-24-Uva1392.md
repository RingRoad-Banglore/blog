## Input

```

A DNA sequence or genetic sequence is a succession of letters representing the primary structure of
a real or hypothetical DNA molecule or strand, with the capacity to carry information. The possible
letters are A, C, G, and T, representing the four nucleotide subunits of a DNA strand: adenine, cytosine,
guanine and thymine bases covalently linked to phospho-backbone.

DNA sequences undergo mutations during the evolution of species, which means that some letters
are randomly replaced with others. Therefore, the DNA sequences of two closely related species are very
similar, and the difference increases as the distance between the species increases. The mutations do
not occur with uniform frequency throughout the sequence; typically there are fewer mutations at the
biologically important parts, since even a single mutation can be lethal at such a place. On the other
hand, if a part of the sequence does not carry any biologically relevant information, then mutations on
this part have no effect. It follows that if we compare the DNA sequences of two species and a particular
region of the sequence contains fewer than the average number of mutations, then most probably this
part of the sequence plays an important biological role. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to identify
such regions. More precisely, a conserved region is a consecutive interval of the DNA sequence such
that in this region at most p percent of the letters are different in the two sequences. Your task is to
write a program that, given two DNA sequences, finds the longest conserved region.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers:
1  n  150000, the length of the genetic sequences and 1  p  99, the maximum percentage of
mutated letters allowed in a conserved region. This is followed by two lines, each containing a DNA
sequence of length n. The sequence contains only the letters A, C, G, and T.

The input is terminated by a test case with n = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, you have to output a line containing a single integer: the length of the longest
conserved region between the two sequences. If there are no conserved regions in the input, then
output No solution. (without quotes).
