The government of Disleksik Piples Ripublyc had decided to improve literacy level of its citizens. To
this end, the government issued a decree with a full list of dictionary words.

The rules for construction of new words were also greatly simplified: an approved word must either
be a dictionary word or consist of two parts, where the first part must be a dictionary word or its
non-empty prefix, and the second part  a dictionary word or its non-empty suffix.

The Institute of Language Simplification has assigned you the task to count the number of different
approved words that can be constructed from the given dictionary.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line of the input file contains the number of dictionary words n (1  n  10000). The

following n lines contain dictionary words, one word per line. Dictionary words are composed of
lowercase Latin letters and are at least 1 and at most 40 letters in length.

The Institute of Language Simplification did not necessary do a good job of cleaning the input data,
so their list may contain duplicates.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write to the output on a line by itself.
The output file must contain a single integer  the number of different approved words.
