## Input

```text
A Context Free Grammar (CFG) consists of the followings: a set of nonterminal symbols V; a set of
terminal symbols T; a special nonterminal symbol called the root and a set of production rules. If all
the production rules are either of the form A -> BC, or A -> a, where A, B, C is a member of set V
and a is a member of set T then we say that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

If we repeatedly apply the production rules over the root symbol we will finally end up with a string
of terminals. Alternatively, we can start with a string of terminals and reduce it using given production
rules.

For example the string ab can be obtained by the first CFG presented in the sample input in the
following way:

S -> AB
AB -> aB ; because A -> a
aB -> ab ; because B -> b

But, we cannot obtain a from S by applying the production rules. The set of strings of terminals
derivable from the root symbol of a CFG is called the Language of the CFG. In this problem you are
required to determine whether a given string of terminals is in the Language of a CFG or not.
```

## Output

```text
There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case describes a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form
and will adhere to the following description. In the first line there will be the root symbol. It will
always be an uppercase English letter. In line 2 the set V will be presented as a string of uppercase
letters. Each character of the string will be identified as a member of V. The set T will be given as a
string of printable characters (except # or any whitespace characters) in line 3. Each character of the
string will be identified as a member of T. Then there will be several lines for each production rule. A
production rule will be of the form A -> BC or of the form  A -> a. Here A, B, C are from set V and
a is from set T. A production rule of the form # -> # indicates the end of production rules. After
that there will be several lines each containing a candidate string of printable characters. This string
will not contain any character from V and there will be no more than 50 characters in it. The list of
candidate strings will be terminated with a line containing a # in the first column.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each candidate string  print  is in L(G) if it can derived from the given grammar otherwise
print alpha is not in L(G). Output a blank line after each test case.

```

## Sample Output
