In the course of Linear Algebra, the following theorem is proved:

Theorem. Let A be a square matrix of size n with entries in CC. There are square matrices
T and J of size n such that

A = T1JT, J =




J1 00 00 00
00 J2 00 00

00 00
. . . 00

00 00 00 Jk




where Ji are Jordan cells:

Ji =




i 1 0 0 . . . 0
0 i 1 0 . . . 0

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
0 . . . . . . . . . i 1
0 . . . . . . . . . . . . i




Here i is an eigenvalue of A.

The decomposition A = T1JT , where J is of the form described above, is called a Jordan
decomposition of A. The Jordan decomposition of a matrix may fail to be unique.

Given a matrix A, we can define the matrix exp A in the following way: if A = T1JT is a Jordan
decomposition of A, then expA = T1J T

J  =

Here mi is the size of Ji. If k  l, then the number in the k-th row and l-th column of J i is

jkl =
ei

(l  k)!
,

otherwise it is 0.
It can be proved that expA is independent of the Jordan decomposition of A used. It can also be

proved that if A is real-valued, then expA is also real-valued. Your task is: given a matrix A, compute
expA.

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains the number of the test cases, which is at most 15. The descriptions
of the test cases follow. The first line of a test case description contains one integer N (1  N  8),
denoting the size of the matrix A. Each of the next N lines contains N integers separated by spaces,
describing the matrix A. It is guaranteed that the entries of A are between 0 and 5. The test cases are
separated by blank lines.

```

## Output

```
For each test case in the input, output N lines, each containing N integers separated by spaces,
describing the matrix expA. The numbers must have at least three digits after the decimal point.
Print a blank line between test cases.
