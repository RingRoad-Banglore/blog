title: Uva 01462  Fuzzy Google Suggest

## Input

```text

Google Suggest is a typical feature of the Google search box. It guesses what youre typing and offers
suggestions in real time (Fig 1). Sometimes, we may mistype the keyword. For example, when we want
to find the information of mcgrady (a famouse NBA star), we mistyped it to macgrady (Fig 2).
The clever Google can still give you the right suggestions. It is amazing, isnt it?

In this problem, your job is to implement a similar system. You will be given a data set including
a large amount of English words. Your system should provide the search service. For each input query
word, find the prefix-fuzzy-match words from the data set and ouput the number of those words. In
the following, I will explain you the prefix fuzzy match. When we say the two words are fuzzy-match
(without prefix), we mean that they look similar and their Edit Distance meets a given threshold
(If you have no idea of the Edit Distance, please refer to the Hints below). When we say the word
A is prefix-fuzzy-match (with prefix) to the word B, we mean that there exists a prefix p of word B,
and the Edit Distance between p and B meets a given threshold. For Example, the data set contains
four English words: content, common, onganize, case. The input query contains a word con



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1462  Fuzzy Google Suggest 2/2

and a Edit Distance threshold 1. con is prefix-fuzzy-match to the words content, common,
onganize, but case doesnt meet the condition, because the minimun Edit Distance between all of
its prefixes and con is 2 which is larger than the given threshold 1.
```

## Output

```text
The input file consists of two parts. The first part is a data set with n (1  n  300, 000) English words.
The second part is the m (1  m  300) input queries. Each query has a word and an Edit Distance
threshold edth (0  edth  2), separated by a space. The words in the data set and the queries contain
at most 10 small letters (a-z).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input query, output the number of words from data set that the query word is prefix-fuzzy-
match to.

Hints(From Wikipedia):
The Edit Distance between two strings is given by the minimum number of operations needed to

transform one string into the other, where an operation is an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a
single character. For example, the Edit Distance between kitten and sitting is 3, since the following
three edits change one into the other, and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits:

kitten  sitten (substitution of s for k)
sitten  sittin (substitution of i for e)
sittin  sitting (insert g at the end).
