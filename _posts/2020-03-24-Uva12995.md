Figure 2: Five desired pairs in F4

The Farey sequence of order n is the sequence of completely
reduced fractions between 0 and 1 which, when in lowest
terms, have denominators less than or equal to n, arranged
in ascending order. Farey sequence for different values of n
are shown in the figure on the left below:

F1 =

F4 =

Figure 1:

It is very well known that if m1
n1

and m2
n2

and are two consecutive fractions of a Farey Sequence
then m2n1  m1n2 = 1. But many fractions which are not consecutive also show this property. For
example, in F7, 25 and

1
2

also show this property although they are not consecutive fractions in F7.
Given the value of n, your job is to find number of pair of non-consecutive fractions mi

ni
and mj

nj
, such

that mjni minj = 1.
```

## Input

```
Input file contains at most 20000 lines of input. Each line contains a positive integer which denotes the
value of n (0 < n < 1000001). Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. This line should
not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains number of pair of non-consecutive
fractions mi

ni
and mj

nj
, (j  i > 1) in Farey Series Fn, such that mjni minj = 1.

```

## Sample Input

## Sample Output

```
