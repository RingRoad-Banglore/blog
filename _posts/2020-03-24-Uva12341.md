Geometric series have many important roles in mathematics. An infinite geometric series that has a
positive integer as first term and whose general ratio is a non-negative rational number can be written
as follows:

a+ a

(
p

q

)
+ a

(
p

q

)2
+ a

(
p

q

)3
+ a

(
p

q

)4
+ ... to 

Here a is the first term of geometric series and p and q are non negative integer numbers.
Infinite geometric series converges when the general ratio is less than 1 and diverges when the general

ratio is greater than or equal to 1. In other words converging infinite geometric series has summation
less than infinity. But for this problem, a converging geometric series is a series whose sum does not
exceed a given value, as less than infinity does not indicate any specific value. We refer this given
value as NEXT_TO_NEV ER in this problem. So given the value of NEXT_TO_NEV ER and a,
your job is to find out how many different fractions

(
p
q

)
are there so that the series remain convergent

(Summation not exceeding NEXT_TO_NEV ER).
```

## Input

```
Input file contains less than 550 sets of inputs. The description for each set is given below:

The input for each set is given in a single line. This line contains three integers
NEXT_TO_NEV ER (1000  NEXT_TO_NEV ER  10000), a (1  a  5) and MAXV
(20000  MAXV  100000). Meaning of NEXT_TO_NEV ER and a is already given in the
problem statement. The value MAXV indicates the maximum possible value of p and q. Note that
the minimum possible value for p and q is 0 (zero) and 1 (One) respectively.

Input is terminated by a line containing three zeroes.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed
by two integers s and t. The first integer s denotes how many different possible fractions

(
p
q

)
, are

there considering p and q are relative prime. The second integer t denotes how many different possible
fractions

(
p
q

)
are there considering p and q may or may not be relative primes. Look at the output for

sample input for details.

## Sample Input

```
1000 1 20000
0 0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 121468930 199820000
