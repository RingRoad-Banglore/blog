title: Uva 12357  Ball Stacking
---


## Input

```text
The XYZ TV channel is developing a new game show, where a con-
testant has to make some choices in order to get a prize. The game
consists of a triangular stack of balls, each of them having an integer
value, as the following example shows.

The contestant must choose which balls he is going to take and his
prize is the sum of the values of those balls. However, the contestant
can take any given ball only if he also takes the balls directly on top of
it. This may require taking additional balls using the same rule. Notice
that the contestant may choose not to take any ball, in which case the
prize is zero.

The TV show director is concerned about the maximum prize a contestant can make for a given
stack. Since he is your boss and he does not know how to answer this question, he assigned this task
to you.
```

## Output

```text
Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains an integer N representing the
number of rows of the stack (1  N  1000). The i-th of the next N lines contains i integers Bij
(105  Bij  105 for 1  j  i  N); the number Bij is the value of the j-th ball in the i-th row of
the stack (the first row is the topmost one, and within each row the first ball if the leftmost one).

The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a line with an integer representing the maximum prize a contestant can make
from the stack.
