## Input

```text
Probably everyone in this competition knows the Rubiks Cube,
a challenging 3-D puzzle. Each of it six sides is covered with nine
labels, each label of a color (blue, yellow, orange, white, green
and red). In its initial state, all nine labels on one face have
the same color. One ingenious mechanism enables each face to
be independently rotated, causing the colors of the labels on the
sides to be mixed.

Each of the faces of the Rubiks Cube is denoted by a letter:
F, B, U, D, L, and R, as illustrated in the figure on the right.

The rotation of a face is called a movement. We describe the
movements using the letters that identify the faces:

 a capital letter represents a 90o clockwise turn of the corresponding face;

 a lowercase letter represents a 90o counterclockwise turn of the corresponding face.

For example, F represents a 90o clockwise turn of face F; r represents a 90o counterclockwise turn
of face R. A sequence of movements is denoted by a sequence of letters identifying faces. Thus, rDF
represents a 90o counterclockwise turn of face R, followed by a 90o clockwise turn of face D, followed by
a 90o clockwise turn of face F.

An interesting property of the Rubiks Cube is that any sequence of movements, if applied repeatedly,
causes the cube to return to its original state (the state it had before the first application of the
sequence). For example, after four applications of the sequence B the cube returns to its original state.

You must write a program that, given a sequence of movements, determines the minimum number
of complete applications of that sequence to make the cube return to its original state.

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line, which contains the
sequence of movements.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case your program must print a single line, containing a single integer, indicating the
minimum number of complete applications of the given sequence to make the hub return to its original
state.

Restrictions

 Each sequence has at least one and at most 80 characters.
