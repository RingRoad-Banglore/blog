---


## Input

```
Jamal and Kamal were two friends. They were
renowned for their friendship in their area. Once Ja-
mal lend a big amount from Kamal and didnt back
that within time. At first Kamal didnt say anything
to Jamal but after few days when he understood that
he was not going to give his money, he became rough
on him. And the result is they are now enemies to
each other.

After 3 months there came another two friends to
live, Rahim and Karim. Their houses stood such a
way that the lines connecting Jamals and Kamals
houses with Rahim are perpendicular; the same ap-
plies to Karim. Not only this, the line joining Rahim
and Karims houses made angle /4 radians with
the line joining Jamal and Kamals houses. Intersection of both of the joining lines was known as Dan-
ger Point. Know why? Same thing happened with Rahim and Karim! Money had done the damage
in their friendship and when the four meet, surprisingly it is in that Danger Point, there arise a
long quarrel. And others feel really annoyed with them. So, you a good programmer and neighbor of
them decided to discontinue this situation. To solve this main problem, first you have to solve a little
problem: Find out the distance of Rahim or Karims house from the Danger Point.
