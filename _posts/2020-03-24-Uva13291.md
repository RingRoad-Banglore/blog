title: Uva 13291  Frosting on the Cake
---


## Input

```
Iskander the Baker is decorating a huge cake,
covering the rectangular surface of the cake
with frosting. For this purpose, he mixes frost-
ing sugar with lemon juice and food coloring, in
order to produce three kinds of frosting: yellow,
pink, and white. These colors are identified by
the numbers 0 for yellow, 1 for pink, and 2 for
white.

To obtain a nice pattern, he partitions
the cake surface into vertical stripes of width
A1, A2, . . . , An centimeters, and horizontal
stripes of height B1, B2, . . . , Bn centimeters, for
some positive integer n. These stripes split
the cake surface into n  n rectangles. The
intersection of vertical stripe i and horizontal
stripe j has color number (i + j) mod 3 for all
1  i, j  n. To prepare the frosting, Iskan-
der wants to know the total surface in square
centimeters to be colored for each of the three
colors, and asks for your help.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The input consists of the following integers:

 on the first line: the integer n,

 on the second line: the values of A1, . . . , An, n integers separated with single spaces,

 on the third line: the values of B1, . . . , Bn, n integers separated with single spaces.

Limits
The input satisfies 3  n  100 000 and 1  A1, . . . , An, B1, . . . , Bn  10 000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.

The output should consist of three integers separated with single spaces, representing the total area
for each color 0, 1, and 2.
