title: Uva 10073  Constrained Exchange Sort
---


## Input

```
Given a permutation of 12 letters A-L, you are invited to write a program to sort them in ascending
order under the following set of constraints:

 The only allowed operation is the exchange of letters between two locations (locations are num-
bered from 1 to 12).

 The letter L must be involved in each operation.

 The letter L at location l1 can be swapped with the letter at location l2 provided l1 l2 = di and

floor((l1  1)/di+1) = floor((l2  1)/di+1)

for i = 1, 2, 3, where (d1, d2, d3, d4) = (1, 3, 6, 12).

 You must use the minimum number of exchange operations possible.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer representing the number of test cases to follow. Each
test case contains a permutation of the letters A-L on a line by itself. It is guaranteed that the given
permutation can be sorted in ascending order under the given set of constraints.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case first output the permutation number on a line by itself. The next line will contain a
sequence of letters where the letter at location i represents the letter with which L is swapped in the
i-th exchange during the sorting process. Output an empty line after each test case.
