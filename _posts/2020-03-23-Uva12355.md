12355 Consecutive Sums
The sum of p (p > 0) consecutive integers can often be equal to the sum of next q consecutive positive
integers. For example:

9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 13 + 14 + 15. Here p = 4 and q = 3
4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 9 + 10 + 11. Here p = 5 and q = 3.

Given the value of q, how many possible values of p are there?

## Input
The input file contains at most 1500 lines of inputs. Each line contains a positive integer less than 1014,
which denotes the value of q. Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. This line should
not be processed.

## Output
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer, which denotes the total
number of possible values of p.

## Sample Input
<p>5</p><p>1</p><p>0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>6</p><p>2</p>
