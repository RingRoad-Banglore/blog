title: Uva 13113  Presidential Election

## Input

```
Logombia is a beautiful country located in the middle of the continent, surrounded by two seas and
constituted as a democratic state. Now its time for the Logombians to choose their president, but the
organization of the event is a little late ... thats why they hired you to automatize the process.

As you well know, the right wing always postulate a candidate, like the left wing does too. On the
other hand, in Logombia exists a lot of independent political factions, of which at least one postulate a
candidate. With this conditions, there will be at least 3 candidates in the first round of elections. If a
candidate gets a percentage greater than or equal to 50.1% will be elected as a president, in the other
case the two candidates with the most votes will pass to a second round.

Because of its mountainous geographical condition, there arent a very effective way to communicate
different states in the country. Each state makes the election in a defined day and when they have
finished counting votes they send a report to the capital where it indicate the amount of people who
vote and the percentage of votes that each candidate gets in the state. It is guaranteed that the number
of votes for each candidate in each state is an integer number.

Losers candidates will organize protest marches and will blame the capitalism or Communism ac-
cording to the case, but that is not your problem. Your work is process all the reports sent by each
state and define who is the new president and how many votes he obtains, or well, who are the two
candidates that dispute the second round and the amount of votes each one gets.
