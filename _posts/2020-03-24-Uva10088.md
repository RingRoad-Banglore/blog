## Input

```

Figure: A sample of my island

I have bought an island where I want to plant
trees in rows and columns. So, the trees will
form a rectangular grid and each of them can be
thought of having integer coordinates by taking
a suitable grid point as the origin.

But, the problem is that the island itself is
not rectangular. So, I have identified a simple
polygonal area inside the island with vertices on
the grid points and have decided to plant trees
on grid points lying strictly inside the polygon.

Now, I seek your help for calculating the
number of trees that can be planted on my is-
land.
```

## Output

```
The input file may contain multiple test cases.
Each test case begins with a line containing an
integer N (3  N  1, 000) identifying the
number of vertices of the polygon. The next
N lines contain the vertices of the polygon ei-
ther in clockwise or in anti-clockwise direction. Each of these N lines contains two integers identifying
the x and y-coordinates of a vertex. You may assume that none of the coordinates will be larger than
1,000,000 in absolute values.

A test case containing a zero for N in the first line terminates the input.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input print a line containing the number of trees that can be planted inside
the polygon.
