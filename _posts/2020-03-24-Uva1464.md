title: Uva 01464  Traffic Real Time Query System
---


## Input

```

City C is really a nightmare of all drivers for its traffic jams. To solve the traffic problem, the mayor
plans to build a RTQS (Real Time Query System) to monitor all traffic situations. City C is made up
of N crossings and M roads, and each road connects two crossings. All roads are bidirectional. One
of the important tasks of RTQS is to answer some queries about route-choice problem. Specifically,
the task is to find the crossings which a driver MUST pass when he is driving from one given road to
another given road.
```

## Output

```
There are multiple test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains two integers N and M , representing the number of the crossings and roads.
The next M lines describe the roads. In those M lines, the i-th line (i starts from 1)contains two

integers Xi and Yi, representing that roadi connects crossing Xi and Yi (Xi = Yi).
The following line contains a single integer Q, representing the number of RTQs.
Then Q lines follows, each describing a RTQ by two integers S and T (S = T ) meaning that a

driver is now driving on the roads and he wants to reach roadt. It will be always at least one way from
roads to roadt.

The input ends with a line of 0 0.
Please note that: 0 < N  10000, 0 < M  100000, 0 < Q  10000, 0 < Xi, Yi  N , 0 < S,T  M

```

## Sample Input

```
For each RTQ prints a line containing a single integer representing the number of crossings which the
driver MUST pass.
