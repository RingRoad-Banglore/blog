London Olympics is approaching very shortly  in just 3 years. Three years might not sound as that
small a time to say just, but it is indeed for those who have to organize the competition. There are so
many things to do  preparing the venues, building the Olympic village for accommodating athletes
and officials, improving the transportation of the entire city as the venues are located all over the city
and also there will be great number of tourists / spectators during the Olympics.

One of the most important tasks is to build the stadium. You are appointed as a programmer to
help things out in certain matters  more specifically in designing and building the athletics tracks.
After some study, you find out that athletics tracks have a general shape of a rectangle with two sliced
circles on two ends. Now the turf that is placed inside this rectangle is prepared elsewhere and comes in
different shapes  different length to width ratios. You know one thing for certain  your track should
have a perimeter of 400 meters. Thats the standard length for athletics tracks. You are supplied with
the design parameter  length to width ratio. You are also told that the sliced circles will be such that
they are part of the same circle. You have to find the length and width of the rectangle.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 1000 test cases. Each test case will be given in one line. It will contain ratio of
the length and width of the rectangle in the format a : b. Here, a and b will be integers and both
will be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line in the following format Case n: L W  where n is the case no (starting
from 1) and L and W are length and width of the rectangle (in meters) respectively. You can output
as many digits as you want after the decimal point. Output will be verified by a validator for 1E-5
precision.
