title: Uva 00534  Frogger
---


```
Freddy Frog is sitting on a stone in the middle of a lake. Suddenly he notices Fiona Frog who is sitting
on another stone. He plans to visit her, but since the water is dirty and full of tourists sunscreen, he
wants to avoid swimming and instead reach her by jumping.

Unfortunately Fionas stone is out of his jump range. Therefore Freddy considers to use other stones
as intermediate stops and reach her by a sequence of several small jumps.

To execute a given sequence of jumps, a frogs jump range obviously must be at least as long as the
longest jump occuring in the sequence.

The frog distance (humans also call it minimax distance) between two stones therefore is defined as
the minimum necessary jump range over all possible paths between the two stones.

You are given the coordinates of Freddys stone, Fionas stone and all other stones in the lake. Your
job is to compute the frog distance between Freddys and Fionas stone.

## Input

```
The input file will contain one or more test cases. The first line of each test case will contain the
number of stones n (2  n  200). The next n lines each contain two integers xi, yi (0  xi, yi  1000)
representing the coordinates of stone #i. Stone #1 is Freddys stone, stone #2 is Fionas stone, the
other n  2 stones are unoccupied. Theres a blank line following each test case. Input is terminated
by a value of zero (0) for n.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line saying Scenario #x and a line saying Frog Distance = y where x
is replaced by the test case number (they are numbered from 1) and y is replaced by the appropriate
real number, printed to three decimals. Put a blank line after each test case, even after the last one.
