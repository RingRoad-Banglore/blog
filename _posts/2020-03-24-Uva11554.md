## Input

```text
Bob is a world-renowned stick collector. His most prized stick possessions include:

 an Arctic Redwood branch from a hike near Dawson City,

 a Desert Pine stick from a visit to the Grand Canyon, and

 a Chinese Arbour twig from an adventure into Tibet.

Bob collects sticks in a peculiar way. He will only accept a new stick into his collection if its length
is exactly length n+ 1 cm where n is the number of sticks currently in his collection. This implies his
collection of n sticks contains exactly one stick of length 1 cm through n cm.

One day Alice visited Bob to inspect his stick collection (upon Bobs insistence of course). Alice
wasnt particularly interested in Bobs excessive descriptions and needed a quick conversation changer.
Cleverly, she posed the following question to Bob: If you are allowed to take any 3 sticks from your
collection, how many different triangles can you make?

Can you help Bob answer the question so he can get back to telling Alice about his sticks?
```

## Output

```text
The input will begin with t (1  t  1000), the number of test cases. Each test case will contain an
integer n (3  n  1000000), the number of sticks in Bobs collection. (Recall if Bob has n sticks, then
he has exactly one stick of each of the lengths from 1 cm through n cm.)

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output on a line the number of different triangles you can make with Bobs sticks.
Triangles X and Y are different if there is at least one stick in X that is not in Y . A triangle has area
strictly greater than 0.

```
