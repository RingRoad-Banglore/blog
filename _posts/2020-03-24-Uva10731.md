```
A vocational preference test, unlike an aptitude test, seeks to
identify careers that the candidate might find satisfying. Based on
the answers to a slew of seemingly inane multiple-choice questions
like the one below, the test determines which occupations suit the
candidates personality.

Which would you rather spend an afternoon doing?

(a) feeding chickens
(b) driving a race car
(c) watching The Simpsons on TV
(d) suntanning
(e) building a dog house

Each question asks the candidate to express a preference from
among five activities, selected from a common larger set. That is,
activities like feeding chickens or suntanning are likely to appear
in several different questions.

If a candidate answers A in a question containing A, B, C,
D, E as alternatives, this choice indicates a preference for A over
each of B, C, D, E. Also, if one answer indicates a preference for
X over Y and one or more other answers indicate a preference for
Y over Z, the combined set of answers indicates a preference for
X over Z.

The candidate may provide contradictory answers; that is, the
answers may indicate a preference for X over Y and also for Y
over X. These contradictions indicate inconsistency, a personalitiy
attribute that may suggest a career in politics or used auto sales.

Given a set of answers to a vocational preference test, you
are to partition the activities into the minimal number of sets
such that, for each pair within a given set, the answers indicate
a contradictory preference.
