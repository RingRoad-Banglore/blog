10084 Hotter Colder
The children’s game Hotter Colder is played as follows. Player A leaves the room while player B hides
an object somewhere in the room. Player A re-enters at position (0,0) and then visits various other
positions about the room. When player A visits a new position, player B announces “Hotter” if this
position is closer to the object than the previous position; player B announces “Colder” if it is farther
and “Same” if it is the same distance.

## Input
Input consists of up to 50 lines, each containing an x, y coordinate pair followed by ‘Hotter’, ‘Colder’,
or ‘Same’. Each pair represents a position within the room, which may be assumed to be a square with
opposite corners at (0,0) and (10,10).

## Output
For each line of input print a line giving the total area of the region in which the object may have been
placed, to 2 decimal places. If there is no such region, output ‘0.00’.
