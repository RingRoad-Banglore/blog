title: Uva 12510  Collecting Coins
---


## Input

```text
In a maze of r rows and c columns, your task is to collect as many coins as possible.

Each square is either your start point S(which will become empty after you leave), an empty square
., a coin square C (which will become empty after you step on this square and thus collecting the
coin), a rock square O or an obstacle square X.

At each step, you can move one square to the up, down, left or right. You cannot leave the maze
or enter an obstacle square, but you can push each rock at most once (i.e. You can treat a rock as an
obstacle square after you push it).

To push a rock, you must stand next to it. You can only push the rock along the direction youre
facing, into an neighboring empty square (you cant push it outside the maze, and you cant push it to
a square containing a coin). For example, if the rock is to your immediate right, you can only push it
to its right neighboring square.

Find the maximal number of coins you can collect.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains a single integer T (T  25), the number of test cases. Each test case
begins with two integers r and c (2  r, c  10), then followed by r lines, each with c columns. There
will be at most 5 rocks and at most 10 coins in each maze.
