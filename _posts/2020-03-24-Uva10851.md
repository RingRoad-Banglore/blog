title: Uva 10851  2D Hieroglyphs decoder
---


```
Steganography is one of the most famous techniques for hiding information in different places, including
images. Recently, for example, Xerox announced they were releasing a 2D-hieroglyphs that were able
to codify a message within them. Your task is to decipher a 2D-hieroglyph.

A 2D hieroglyph is a matrix H of 10 rows and M + 2 columns that encode a message of length M
characters (c0, c1, . . . , cM1). The matrix H has the following lattice:

Hi,j =




/ i = 0, j  (0, 1, . . . ,M + 1)
/ i = 9, j  (0, 1, . . . ,M + 1)
/ j = 0, i  (0, 1, . . . , 9)
/ j = M + 1, i  (0, 1, . . . , 9)
b(i 1, cj1) i  (1, 2, . . . , 8) , j  (1, 2, . . . ,M)

where

b(i, c) =

{ / if ( c
2i

)
mod 2 = 0

\ if
(

c
2i

)
mod 2 = 1

and c is the ASCII value of the character passed to the b function.
Your task is to find the message given the matrix H.
```

## Input

```
The input is composed of a first line with a number N indicating the number of messages to decode,
followed by N matrices separated by a newline character. The length of any message will not be
more than 80 characters.

```

## Output

```
The output must have N messages, one per each matrix given in the input.

```
