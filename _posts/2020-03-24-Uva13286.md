title: Uva 13286  Ingredients

```
The chef of a restaurant aspiring for a Michelin star wants to display a selection of her signature dishes
for inspectors. For this, she has allocated a maximum budget B for the cumulated cost, and she wants
to maximize the cumulated prestige of the dishes that she is showing to the inspectors.

To measure the prestige of her dishes, the chef maintains a list of recipes, along with their costs and
ingredients. For each recipe, a derived dish is obtained from a base dish by adding an ingredient. The
recipe mentions two extra pieces of information: the cost of applying the recipe, on top of the cost of
the base dish, and the prestige the recipe adds to the prestige of the base dish. The chef measures the
prestige by her own units, called prestige units.

For example, a recipe list for making pizza looks like:

 pizza tomato pizza base tomato 1 2

 pizza classic pizza tomato cheese 5 5

Here, pizza base is an elementary dish, a dish with no associated recipe, a dish so simple that its cost
is negligible (set to 0) and its prestige also 0. The chef can obtain the derived dish pizza tomato by
adding the ingredient tomato to the base dish pizza base, for a cost of 1 euro and a gain of 2 prestige
units. A pizza classic is obtained from a pizza tomato by adding cheese, for an added cost of 5,
and a prestige of 5 added to the prestige of the base dish; this means the total cost of pizza classic
is 6 and its total prestige is 7.

A signature dish selection could for instance include both a pizza tomato and a pizza classic.
Such a selection would have cumulated total prestige of 9, and cumulated total cost of 7.

Armed with the list of recipes and a budget B, the chef wants to provide a signature dish selection
to Michelin inspectors so that the cumulated total prestige of the dishes is maximized, keeping their
cumulated total cost at most B.

Important Notes

 No dish can appear twice in the signature dish selection.

 Any dish that does not appear as a derived dish in any recipe is considered to be an elementary
dish, with cost 0 and prestige 0.

 A dish can appear more than once as a resulting dish in the recipe list; if there is more than one
way to obtain a dish, the one yielding the smallest total cost is always chosen; if the total costs
are equal, the one yielding the highest total prestige should be chosen.

 The recipes are such that no dish D can be obtained by adding one or more ingredients to D
itself.

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

 The first line consists of the budget B, an integer.

 The second line consists of the number N of recipes, an integer.

 Each of the following N lines describes a recipe, as the following elements separated by single
spaces: the derived dish name (a string); the base dish name (a string); the added ingredient
(a string); the added price (an integer); the added prestige (an integer).

Limits

 0  B  10 000;

 0  N  1 000 000;

 there can be at most 10 000 different dishes (elementary or derived);

 costs and prestiges in recipes are between 1 and 10 000 (inclusive);

 strings contain at most 20 ASCII characters (letters, digits, and   only).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.

The output should consist of two lines, each with a single integer. On the first line: the maximal
cumulated prestige within the budget. On the second line: the minimal cumulated cost corresponding
to the maximal cumulated prestige, necessarily less than or equal to the budget.
