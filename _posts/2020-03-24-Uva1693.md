## Input

```

XAR lab recently develops a new computer for data compression  XAR08. Each time, XAR08 will
get an integer sequence from input, and output it after compression.

XAR08 is composed of several 8-bit binary storage units. Each storage unit can store an 8-bit
unsigned integer and support 4 directives. A program in XAR08 is a directive sequence composed of
these 4 directives as follows:

X n the integer in each storage unit XOR n, 0  n < 256,
Equivalence: V = V ^n

A n add n to each storage unit and mod 256, 0  n < 256,
Equivalence: V = (V + n)%256

R n rotate each storage unit n-bit binary left, 0  n < 8,
Equivalence: V = (((V >> (8 n))|(V << n))&0xFF)

E n the program ends, 0  n < 256, ignore the value of n. Every program should end with this
directive.

Each time, XAR08 gets an integer sequence with the length of N from input. These N integers
will be stored in the first N storage units in order (The number of storage units is enough). After
compression, the value in these N storage units will be sent to output in the same order.

XAR08s data compression operation is based on a transformation f : Transform the input sequence
(all elements are different) D = (d0, d1, . . . dn1) to the sequence (0, 1, . . . , n 1), i.e. f(di) = i(0  i <
n).

Your task is, for each input sequence, write an XAR08 program composed of the above four directives
to implement the transformation f . XAR08 is still in research stage, so it can only execute a program
with no more than 40, 000 directives.
```

## Output

```
Input contains several cases. The first line in each case contains an integer n (n  128), which is the
length of sequence D, followed by a line of n different integers, d0, d1, . . . , dn1, 0  di < 128.

The last case is followed by a line containing a zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, the first line outputs Case ?:. If exists a XAR08 program composed of no more than
40, 000 directives, output the program from the second line. Otherwise output Impossible! (quotes
for clarity) in the second line.

Dont print any extra spaces or blank lines.
