title: Uva 10416  Folding My TShirt
---


## Input

```
I have a T-Shirt. When I dont wear it any more, I fold it up. For most of the time, I can find a line
so that the parts of the T-shirt on both sides are symmetrical. Then, I can fold it along that line. But
sadly, I cannot find such a line for some strange (really really strange, see sample input ^_^) T-shirts.

In the example above, I can fold the T-shirt along the dash line, then, I got the figure on the right.
Could you tell me if I can succeed?
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (t  20) indicating the number of test cases. Each
test case begins with a line containing a single integer n (3  n  100) indicating the number of points
of the polygon. In the next n lines each contain a pair of integers (xi, yi), indicating the position of the
points. The points are given in the counter-clockwise order. The T-Shirt is valid. i.e not self-crossing.
But the T-Shirt maybe not convex.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a line corresponding the answer. Answer Yes if the T-Shirt can be folded,
No otherwise.
