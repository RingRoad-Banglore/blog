title: Uva 00878  Rotating Tetris Pieces
---


## Input

```
A tetris piece is a two-dimensional figure made up from unit squares. Valid tetris pieces are constructed
by stacking squares together to the left, right, bottom or top of each other. Figure 1 shows three tetris
pieces made up from 4 squares.

Figure 1  Different pieces made with 4 squares.

Given a tetris piece we consider the ones obtained by rotating it on the plane by 0, 90, 180, 270
degrees. Some pieces generate four different figures by these rotations (cf. figure 1 right), whereas in
others we get repeated figures (cf. figure 1 left and center).

Write a program that reads as input the coordinates of the squares making up a piece and outputs
the number of different pieces obtained by rotations.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself in-
dicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described
below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank
line between two consecutive inputs.

The input is a sequence of (x, y) coordinate pairs; the values for
x and y are non-negative integers and separated by a , (a comma);
coordinate pairs are separated by white-spaces and the order among
pairs is non-relevant. The end of the list is marked by a -1,-1.

Example: for the piece on the right, the input data could be: 0,1
0,2 1,1 2,1 2,0 -1,-1

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

The output should be the number of different pieces obtained by rotations (between 1 and 4). For
the input above the output should be 2.

```

## Sample Output

```
1

0,1 0,2 1,1 2,1 2,0 -1,-1

```
