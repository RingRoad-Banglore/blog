title: Uva 00906  Rational Neighbor
---


```

As we know, finding a rational close to a given rational is straightforward. The minimal distance
between two distinct integers is 1. By contrast, there is no minimal distance between two distinct
rationals. A straightforward method for finding a rational close to a given rational a/b is based on the
following construction. For every m > 0 one has a/b = (am)/(bm), and the neighbors (am  1)/(bm)
lie at distance 1/(bm) from the given rational. So, by choosing m to be sufficiently large, one can make
the distance to be as small as we please.

Given a rational a/b and an upper bound n for the distance, the problem consists to find the rational
c/d such that:

(i) a/b < c/d;

(ii) the distance between the rationals a/b and c/d is smaller or equal than n;

(iii) the denominator d is as small as possible.

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them consisting of two lines.
The first line of the input contains two positive integers a and b which define the rational number

a/b. The integers a and b are assumed to be in the interval [1, 100000]. The second line contain a
positive real number n, 0.00000001  n  0.1, which gives the maximum distance allowed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write to the output, on a line by itself, the two positive integers c and d which solve
the problem.
