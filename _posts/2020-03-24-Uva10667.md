title: Uva 10667  Largest Block
---


## Input

```text
Consider a n  n chessboard. The term block(r1, c1, r2, c2) denotes the rectangular subset of squares
defined by the intersection of rows {r1, r1 + 1, . . . , r2} and columns {c1, c1 + 1, . . . , c2}.

There are several occupied blocks on the board. We are interested in the largest block (in the sense
of maximum area) that can be placed in the free space remaining in the board.

For example, in a chessboard of size 10, if block(2, 2, 5, 3), block(8, 3, 9, 7), and block(3, 6, 3, 8) rep-
resent occupied space, then the largest block that can be placed in free space has area 28. This can be
visually checked in the following figure:

r\c 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1
2 X X
3 X X X X X
4 X X o o o o o o o
5 X X o o o o o o o
6 o o o o o o o
7 o o o o o o o
8 X X X X X
9 X X X X X
10

We are interested only in the area of the largest free block, and not in its particular location. Therefore,
each instance of the problem has a unique solution.
```

## Output

```text
The program first reads the number p of instances of the problem. Each instance is described by the
size s of the board, the number b of blocks of occupied space, and the vertices r1, c1, r2, c2, of each
block:

p number of problem instances in the file
s (board size) instance #1
n (number of blocks)
r1 c1 r2 c2 (first block)
r1 c1 r2 c2 (second block)
. . . . . .
r1 c1 r2 c2 (n-th block)
s (board size) instance #2
n (number of blocks)
r1 c1 r2 c2 (first block)
r1 c1 r2 c2 (second block)
. . . . . .
r1 c1 r2 c2 (n-th block)
. . . . . . instance #p
