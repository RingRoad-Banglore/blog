title: Uva 11191  Perfect Square
---


## Input

```text
People in the Byteland do not love large prime numbers. So they never use the integers having prime
factors greater than 30. They love perfect square number. An integer is a perfect square if its square
root is an integer. 0,1,4,9 are perfect square numbers. But -4 or 3 is not perfect square.

Now people at Byteland have a sequence of n numbers. They select nC2 pairs of numbers from this
sequence. A pair is a square pair if the product of its numbers is a perfect square. They are interested
to calculate the number of square pairs X among these nC2 pairs. Again they select nC3triples of
numbers from this sequence. A triple is a square triples if the product of its numbers is a perfect
square. They are interested to calculate the number of square triples Y among these nC3 triples. Help
them to calculate X and Y .
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains T the number of test case. Then following lines contains T Test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing one integer n the length of the sequence. The next line
contains n integers separated by a single space.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output contain 2 integers X and Y separated by a single space.

Constraints:

 0 < n  200000

 Each number in the sequence will have absolute value < 1018.

 No number in the sequence will have prime factor greater than 30. But the sequence may contain
the number zero as an exception.

```
