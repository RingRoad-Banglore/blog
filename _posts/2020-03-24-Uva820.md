title: Uva 00820  Internet Bandwidth
---


```
On the Internet, machines (nodes) are richly intercon-
nected, and many paths may exist between a given
pair of nodes. The total message-carrying capacity
(bandwidth) between two given nodes is the maximal
amount of data per unit time that can be transmitted
from one node to the other. Using a technique called
packet switching, this data can be transmitted along
several paths at the same time.

For example, the following figure shows a network
with four nodes (shown as circles), with a total of five
connections among them. Every connection is labeled
with a bandwidth that represents its data-carrying
capacity per unit time.

In our example, the bandwidth between node 1 and node 4 is 25, which might be thought of as the
sum of the bandwidths 10 along the path 1-2-4, 10 along the path 1-3-4, and 5 along the path 1-2-3-4.
No other combination of paths between nodes 1 and 4 provides a larger bandwidth.

You must write a program that computes the bandwidth between two given nodes in a network,
given the individual bandwidths of all the connections in the network. In this problem, assume that
the bandwidth of a connection is always the same in both directions (which is not necessarily true in
the real world).
```

## Input

```
The input file contains descriptions of several networks. Every description starts with a line containing
a single integer n (2  n  100), which is the number of nodes in the network. The nodes are numbered
from 1 to n. The next line contains three numbers s, t, and c. The numbers s and t are the source
and destination nodes, and the number c is the total number of connections in the network. Following
this are c lines describing the connections. Each of these lines contains three integers: the first two are
the numbers of the connected nodes, and the third number is the bandwidth of the connection. The
bandwidth is a non-negative number not greater than 1000.

There might be more than one connection between a pair of nodes, but a node cannot be connected
to itself. All connections are bi-directional, i.e. data can be transmitted in both directions along a
connection, but the sum of the amount of data transmitted in both directions must be less than the
bandwidth.

A line containing the number 0 follows the last network description, and terminates the input.

## Output

```
For each network description, first print the number of the network. Then print the total bandwidth
between the source node s and the destination node t, following the format of the sample output. Print
a blank line after each test case.
