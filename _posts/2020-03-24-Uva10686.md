title: Uva 10686  SQF Problems

## Input

```
Juciano, Sebastio e Srgio formed a very good ACM team. They used to do a lot of problems but they
were not organized and they have never classified the problems when they solved them.

As the ACM South America Regional was approaching, they decided to classify all their problems.
Of course, there were hundreds of problems and they decided to apply a sistematic approach to speed
up the process.

In their approach a problem would be classified based in key words. As example, a graph prob-
lem would be identified by words as: node, edge, distance etc. On the other hand, typical words in
geometrical problems are: point, convex, polygon etc.

But a lot of problems could not be classified, because they did not fit in any category. Coincidently,
Srgio had solved all unclassified problems, because he spent his time trying to do ACM problems but
almost all were very easy. So Juciano and Sebastio decided to classify these unclassified problems as
SQF, that is mean: made by Srgio (Srgio que fez, in Portuguese).

Your task is help them to classify their problems. A problem can be fit in more than one category,
if the problem did not fit in any category, it is a SQF problem.
```

## Output

```
The input set consists of a positive number N  30, that gives the number of test cases. Each test case
starts with a number C  20, the number of categories. After, each category is described by a string S,
the name of the category, and two integers W  10, the number of key words in this category, and P ,
how many different words should appear in the description problem so the problem fits in this category.
Follow W lines, each one with a key word of this category. All names are less than 31 characters, all in
the range a..z and A..Z.

Finally, there will be the problem description, with at most 1200 lines, each line has fewer than 101
characters and there are no words divided between two lines. The words are case sensitive and two
words are equals only if they match exactly. The end of a problem description is indicated by a blank
line.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input set, you shoud output a line indicating the problems category. If the problem fits in
more than one category, you shoud print them all, in the order they appear in the input, separated
only by commas. If the problem does not fit in any category you should print SQF Problem., without
the quotes.

convex
polygon
boring
This is neither a SQF problem nor a graph problem.
This is a boring geometrical problem. In this problem
you should calculate the convex area of a regular polygon.
