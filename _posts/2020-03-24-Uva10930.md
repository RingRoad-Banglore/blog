title: Uva 10930  A-Sequence
---


## Input

```text
For this problem an A-sequence is a sequence of positive integers ai satisfying 1  a1 < a2 < a3 < . . .
and every ak of the sequence is not the sum of two or more distinct earlier terms of the sequence.

You should write a program to determine if a given sequence it is or it is not an A-sequence.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of a set of lines, each line starts with an integer 2  D  30 that indicates the
number of integers that the current sequence has. Following this number there is the sequence itself.
The sequence is composed by integers, each integer is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal
to 1000. The input is terminated by enf of file (EOF).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input you should print two lines: the first line should indicate the number of
the test case and the test case itself; in the the second line you should print This is an A-sequence.,
if the corresponding test case is an A-sequence or This is not an A-sequence., if the corresponding
test case is not an A-sequence.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2 1 2
3 1 2 3
10 1 3 16 19 25 70 100 243 245 306

```
