title: Uva 12259  Fair Division
---


```
Its your friends birthday, and you and some other people decided to buy him a copy of StarCraft II,
because who wouldnt want to have that?

You agreed to divide the costs as fairly as possible. Since some of you have more money available
than others, you also agreed that nobody has to pay more than he can afford. Every contribution will
be a multiple of 1 cent, i.e., nobody can pay fractions of a cent.

Everybody writes down the maximum amount he is able to contribute. Taking into account these
maximum amounts from everybody, you share the cost of the present as fairly as possible. That means,
you minimize the largest distance of the contributions to 1

n
-th of the total cost. In case of a tie, minimize

the second largest distance, and so on. Since the smallest unit of contribution is 1 cent, there might be
more than one possible division of the cost. In that case, persons with a higher maximum amount pay
more. If there is still ambiguity, those who come first in the list pay more.

Since you bought the present, it is your task to figure out how much everybody has to pay (including
you).
```

## Input

```
On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:

 One line with two integers p and n: the price of the present in cents (1  p  1 000 000) and the
number of people (2  n  100) who contribute to the present (including you).

 One line with n integers ai (1  ai  1 000 000), where ai is the maximum amount, in cents, that
the i-th person on the list is able to contribute.

```

## Output

```
Per test case:

 One line with n integers: the amounts each person has to contribute according to the scheme. If
the total cost cannot be divided according to the above rules, the line must contain IMPOSSIBLE
instead.
