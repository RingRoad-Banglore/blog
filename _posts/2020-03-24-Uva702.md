title: Uva 00702  The Vindictive Coach
---


## Input

```text
The coach of a football team, after suffering for years the adverse comments of the media about his
tactics, decides to take his revenge by presenting his players in a line-up in such a way that the
TV cameras would be compelled to zigzag in a ridiculous bobbing motion, by alternating taller and
shorter players. However, the team captain objects that he must be the first of the line by protocolary
reasons,and that he wants to be seen in the best possible light: that is, he should not have a taller
colleague nest to him unless there is no alternative (everyone else is taller than him). Even in this case,
the height difference should be as small as possible, while maintaining the zigzag arrangement of the
line.

With this condition the coach addresses an expert in computation (i.e. you) to help him find the
number of different alignments he may make, knowing that all players have a different height. They
are always numbered by stature starting by 1 as the shortest one. Of course the number of players may
be arbitrary, provided it does not exceed 22.
```

## Output

```text
It is a set of lines, each of which contains two positive integers N and m separated by a blank space.
N( 22) represents the number of players in the line-up and m the captains number, who as told is
always the first of the line.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For every line of the input a line with positive integer indicating the number of possible alignments
under the above conditions.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3 1
3 3
4 1
