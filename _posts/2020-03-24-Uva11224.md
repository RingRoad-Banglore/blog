## Input

```
It is time to swim and you should help Gustavo to get a good place in the World Swimming Champi-
onship. The competition has two phases. In the first phase, the qualification phase, every competitor
will swim and the eight fastest swimmers will advance to second phase, the big final. During the final,
each competitor will swim again to decide who is the best swimmer. In the beginning of the competition,
every swimmer has associated with him a rank indicating how good he is, where the best competitor
has a rank 1, the second one has rank 2 and so on.

Gustavo wants to reach the finals and to finish in the top three to get a medal, but he does not
want to spend all his energy in the qualification round. Actually, he desires to swim as slow as possible
in the first phase in a way he can still advance to the final and get a medal.

When going to the final, it is important to get a good lane. There are eight lanes in the pool and
each one is assigned to a swimmer according to how fast he swam in the previous phase. The fastest
swimmer gets lane #4 (the best lane), the second gets lane #5, the third gets lane #3, the fourth gets
lane #6, the fifth gets lane #2, the sixth gets lane #7, the seventh gets lane #1 and the eighth one
gets lane #8 (the worst lane).

During the final, Gustavo believes he can swim faster than a competitor if he got a better lane than
him or if he has a better rank than him. Your task is to determine what is the worst possible place
Gustavo can get in the first phase in a way he can advance to the final and get a medal. You should
also determine in which position Gustavo will end at the final.

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, T (1  T  120), after there will be a blank line and
then the first test case. Each test case starts with 8  N  1000, the number of competitors. The
following line will contain an integer R, representing Gustavos rank. Then N  1 lines will follow, each
line has an integer R, representing the rank of that competitor, and a time in the format MM : SS : DD,
which is the time that competitor got in the qualification phase. The first field represents the minutes,
00  MM  09, the second field represents the seconds, 00  SS  59, and the third field represents
hundredths of a second, 00  DD  99. If more than one competitor got the same time, the tie will be
broken according to their ranks, the competitors with best ranks will come first.

You should consider 00:01:00 as the fastest time a competitor can get, being Gustavo the only
swimmer able to achieve a faster time. Be aware that if two competitors are not tied with the same
time, there should exist a difference of at least one hundredth of a second between their times. There
is a blank line after each test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case you must print two lines. The first contains the the number of the test case (see below
the exact format) and the second contains the following message: Gustavo should be #N during
the qualification to achieve position #P in the final..
