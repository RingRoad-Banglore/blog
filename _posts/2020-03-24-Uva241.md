## Input

```
The Atlantic Coastal Mariners (ACM) sailing club is building a race planning tool to estimate durations
of sailboat races with various race courses, wind directions, and types of sailboats. You must write a
program to help with that task.

A race course is defined by marks with up to 10 marks per race course. A sailboat must sail to
all marks in the specified order. The marks are identified as x- and y-coordinates on a hypothetical
grid with a single unit equal to one nautical mile (nm). The positive y-axis is oriented due north and
the positive x-axis is oriented due east. The race course is in open waters without any navigational
limitations.

For purposes of this planning tool, the only driving force controlling a sailboat is the wind. The
wind determines the sailboats speed of advance and limits its direction of travel. The wind is constant
for the duration of each race and is specified in terms of the direction from which the wind is blowing
and its speed in nautical miles per hour (kts). Wind direction is specified as a compass bearing in
degrees measured clockwise from 000.0o as north.

Sailboats cannot steer any closer to the wind than a given point angle off the wind direction. In
order to make progress closer to the wind direction, the sailboat must tack back and forth across the
wind, steering no closer to the wind than its point angle. Each time the sailboat tacks or passes a mark
it incurs a tack penalty. For this simulation, each sailboat will travel each leg of a race (the portion of a
race between successive marks) with the minimum number of tacks and the minimum possible distance.
Courses and directions are specified as compass bearings in degrees measured clockwise from 000.0o as
north.

The speed of a sailboat is determined by the sailboat design, wind speed, and direction steered
relative to the wind. In the figure, the wind direction is 45o and the point angle is 40o. This means
then that this sailboat cannot steer between 5o and 85o because it cannot point that closely into the
wind.

For this problem, the ratio of sailboat speed to wind speed is one of three ratios, selected as shown
in the table below according to the angle off the wind :

Angle off wind Applicable ratio
 point angle and < reach angle point speed ratio
 reach angle and < downwind angle reach speed ratio
 downwind angle downwind speed ratio

For instance, if the boat is steering at an angle off the wind which is between the reach angle and
downwind angle then

boat speed = reach speed ratio wind speed

Point angle is 40o
Reach angle is 60o

Downwind angle is 145o

Sailboat cannot travel from P in this di-
rection

Sailboat traveling from P in this direction
moves at point speed ratio times wind
speed

Sailboat traveling from P in this direction
moves at reach speed ratio times wind
speed

Sailboat traveling from P in this direc-
tion moves at downwind speed ratio times
wind.

Each angle is measured as the smallest
angle between the direction of travel of
the sailboat and the direction from which
the wind is blowing.

## Output

```
Your solution must accept multiple input data sets. Each data set represents a different race course to
be evaluated for a single sailboat. The data set begins with a line with 4 numbers: wind direction (real),
wind speed (real), tack penalty (real), and number of marks n (integer). The next line contains six real
numbers: point angle, point speed ratio, reach angle, reach speed ratio, downwind angle, downwind
speed ratio.

The subsequent n lines of the data set represent the n race marks in the order in which they must
be reached. Each line begins with a 2-character mark id followed by the x-coordinate then y-coordinate
of the mark.

The end of input is denoted by a line of four 0s.

## Sample Input

```
The output for your program consists of various data calculated for each input data set. Values should
be presented with the following precisions and units.

Courses, tacks, directions 0.1 degree Distance 0.01 nm
Speed 0.1 kts Time 0.01 hours

Output for each race begins with a header containing the number of the data set (1 for the first,
2 for the second, etc.) and the number of legs. The next line is the total length of the race course,
measured as the sum of distances between successive marks.

For each leg of the course, the leg number, beginning and ending mark ids, course from the beginning
to end marks of the leg, and the leg distance is presented. This is followed by a listing of the tacks
necessary to complete the leg. The tacks for each race are numbered sequentially, with tack numbers
beginning with 1 for each race. For each tack, the tack number, the projected sailboat speed, the course
steered, and the length of that tack are presented.

The summary output for each data set includes the total number of tacks, the total distance traveled
for the race, the estimated race duration, and the total tack penalty time incurred by the sailboat after
leaving the first mark.

The exact format of the output is not specified, but all output should be organized so that it is in
the specified order, appropriately labeled and follows given numeric specifications.
