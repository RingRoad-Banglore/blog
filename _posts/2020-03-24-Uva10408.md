title: Uva 10408  Farey sequences
---


```
A fraction h/k is called a proper fraction if it lies between
0 and 1 and if h and k have no common factors. For any
natural number n  1, the Farey sequence of order n, Fn,
is the sequence of all proper fractions with denominators
which do not exceed n together with the fraction 1/1,
arranged in increasing order. So, for example, F5 is the
sequence:

1 1 1 2 1 3 2 3 4 1
-, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -.
5 4 3 5 2 5 3 4 5 1

It is not clear exactly who first thought of looking at
such sequences. The first to have proved genuine math-
ematical results about them seems to be Haros, in 1802.
Farey stated one of Haros results without a proof in an
article written in 1816, and when Cauchy subsequently saw
the article he discoverd a proof of the result and ascribed
the concept to Farey, thereby giving rise to the name Farey sequence. Hardy in his A mathematicians
apology writes:

... Farey is immortal because he failed to understand a theorem which Haros had proved
perfectly fourteen years before ...

Surprisingly, certain simple looking claim about Farey sequences is equivalent to the Riemann
hypothesis, the single most important unsolved problem in all of mathematics. Ford circles, see picture,
provide a method of visualizing the Farey sequence.

But your task is much simpler than this.
For a given n, you are to find the k-th fraction in the sequence Fn.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of a sequence of lines containing two natural numbers n and k, 1  n  1000 and k suffi-
ciently small such that there is the k-th term in Fn. (The length of Fn is approximately 0.3039635n2).

```

## Output

```
For each line of input print one line giving the k-th element of Fn in the format as below.
