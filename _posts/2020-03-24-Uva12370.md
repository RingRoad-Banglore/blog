title: Uva 12370  Game of Connect
---


```
In the Game of connect two players are given a graph with n vertices and m edges. Before starting the
game the first player selects two distinct vertices A and B. The goal of the second player is to connect
A and B with a sequence of colored edges. Initially all the edges are uncolored. In his move first player
can select an uncolored edge and deletes it from the graph. In his move second player can select an
uncolored edge and colors it. If second player can connect A and B with a sequence of colored edges
then he wins. Otherwise the first player wins. Players take their move by turns and the first player
always goes first. Given a graph you need to determine whether second player has a winning strategy
or not. Assume that both of the players play perfectly.

## Input

```
First line of the input contains T (T  100) the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line
containing n (2  n  100) and m (1  m  300). Each of the next m lines contains two integers u
and v denoting an edge between u and v. The vertices are numbered from 0 to n  1. There will not
be any duplicate edge.

```

## Output
