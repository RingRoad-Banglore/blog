title: Uva 00763  Fibinary Numbers
---


## Input

```
The standard interpretation of the binary number 1010 is 8 + 2 = 10. An alternate way to view the
sequence 1010 is to use Fibonacci numbers as bases instead of powers of two. For this problem, the
terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . .

Where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms (note that there is only one 1 in the sequence
as defined here). Using this scheme, the sequence 1010 could be interpreted as 15+03+12+01 = 7.
This representation is called a Fibinary number.

Note that there is not always a unique Fibinary representation of every number. For example the
number 10 could be represented as either 8 + 2 (10010) or as 5 + 3 + 2 (1110). To make the Fibinary
representations unique, larger Fibonacci terms must always be used whenever possible (i.e. disallow
2 adjacent 1s). Applying this rule to the number 10, means that 10 would be represented as 8+2
(10010).

Write a program that takes two valid Fibinary numbers and prints the sum in Fibinary form.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases with a blank line between two consecutive.

Each test case consists in two lines with Fibinary numbers. These numbers will have at most 100
digits.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the sum of the two input numbers in Fibinary form.

It must be a blank line between two consecutive outputs.

```

## Sample Output

```
10010
1

10000
1000

10000
10000

```
