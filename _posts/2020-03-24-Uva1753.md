title: Uva 01753  Need for Speed
---


## Input

```text
Sheila is a student and she drives a typical student car: it is
old, slow, rusty, and falling apart. Recently, the needle on the
speedometer fell off. She glued it back on, but she might have
placed it at the wrong angle. Thus, when the speedometer reads
s, her true speed is s+c, where c is an unknown constant (possibly
negative).

Sheila made a careful record of a recent journey and wants to
use this to compute c. The journey consisted of n segments. In
the i-th segment she traveled a distance of di and the speedometer
read si for the entire segment. This whole journey took time t.
Help Sheila by computing c.

Note that while Sheilas speedometer might have negative
readings, her true speed was greater than zero for each segment of the journey.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of input contains two integers n (1  n  1000), the number of sections in Sheilas
journey, and t (1  t  106), the total time. This is followed by n lines, each describing one segment of
Sheilas journey. The i-th of these lines contains two integers di (1  di  1000) and si (|si|  1000),
the distance and speedometer reading for the i-th segment of the journey. Time is specified in hours,
distance in miles, and speed in miles per hour.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, on a line by itself, display the constant c in miles per hour. Your answer should
have an absolute or relative error of less than 106.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3 5
4 -1
4 0
10 3
4 10
5 3
2 2
3 6
3 1

```
