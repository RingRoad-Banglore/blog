## Input

Karim and Rahim go to the same restaurant once every day to have lunch. They both have their own
list of favorite dishes but they dont necessarily eat their favorite dishes at lunch. The restaurant they
visit have N dishes in total. Karim and Rahim choose a dish randomly (They both eat the same dish)
from the N dishes and have it for lunch. They go to that restaurant regularly for D days. You have
to find the probability that the number of days for which the dish chosen is a favorite of Rahims is
exactly twice the number of days for which the dish chosen is a favorite of Karims.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 600 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with an integer N (0 < N < 37) which denotes the total number of dishes. Dishes
are identified by integers from 1..N . Next line starts with an integer S (0  S < N) which denotes the
total number of Karims favorite dishes. Next S distinct integers are favorite dishes of Karim. All these
integers are within the range (1..N). The Next line starts with an integer T (0  T < N) which denotes
the total number of Rahims favorite dishes. Next T distinct integers are favorite dishes of Rahim. All
these integers are also within the range (1..N). The next line contains an integer D (0 < D < 101)
which indicates how many days Karim and Rahim goes to the restaurant.

Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by
the desired probability rounded to five digits after the decimal point. Look at the output for sample
input for details. There is no special judge for this problem. But the judge data is such that errors less
than 2  107 will be ignored. But please make sure when the answer very near to zero you print it as
0.00000 and not as -0.00000.
