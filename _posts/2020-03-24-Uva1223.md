## Input

```

Mr. Kim is a professional programmer. Re-
cently he wants to design a new editor which
has as many functions as possible. Most editors
support a simple search function that finds one
occurrence (or all occurrences successively) of a
query pattern string in the text.

He observed that the search function in
commercial editors does nothing if no query
pattern is given. His idea of a new search func-
tion regards each substring of the given text as a
query pattern string itself and his new function
finds another occurrence in the text. The prob-
lem is that there can be occurrences of many
substrings in the text. So, Mr. Kim decides that the new function finds only occurrences of the longest
substring in the text in order to remedy the problem. A formal definition of the search function is as
follows:

Given a text string S, find the longest substring in text string S such that the substring appears at
least twice. The two occurrences are allowed to overlap.
```

## Output

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. For each test case, a text string S is given in one line.
For every string, the length is less than or equal to 5,000 and the alphabet


is the set of lowercase

English characters.

```

## Sample Input

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. Print the length
of the longest substring in text string S such that the substring appears at least twice.
