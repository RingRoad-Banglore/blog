title: Uva 12299  RMQ with Shifts
---


## Input

```text
In the traditional RMQ (Range Minimum Query) problem, we have a static array A. Then for each
query (L,R) (L  R), we report the minimum value among A[L], A[L + 1], , A[R]. Note that the
indices start from 1, i.e. the left-most element is A[1].

In this problem, the array A is no longer static: we need to support another operation

shift(i1, i2, i3, . . . , ik)(i1 < i2 < . . . < ik, k > 1)

we do a left circular shift of A[i1], A[i2], , A[ik].
For example, if A={6, 2, 4, 8, 5, 1, 4}, then shift(2, 4, 5, 7) yields {6, 8, 4, 5, 4, 1, 2}. After that,

shift(1, 2) yields 8, 6, 4, 5, 4, 1, 2.
```

## Output

```text
There will be only one test case, beginning with two integers n, q (1  n  100, 000, 1  q  250, 000),
the number of integers in array A, and the number of operations. The next line contains n positive
integers not greater than 100,000, the initial elements in array A. Each of the next q lines contains an
operation. Each operation is formatted as a string having no more than 30 characters, with no space
characters inside. All operations are guaranteed to be valid.

Warning: The dataset is large, better to use faster I/O methods.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query, print the minimum value (rather than index) in the requested range.

```

## Sample Output

```text
7 5
6 2 4 8 5 1 4
query(3,7)
shift(2,4,5,7)
query(1,4)
shift(1,2)
query(2,2)

```
