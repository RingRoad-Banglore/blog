## Input

```
Taman is excited to announce that he has learnt bitwise AND operation. His Big Sister Titly has
given him a sequence of non-negative integers x1, x2, . . . , xn as key. To test that whether Taman knows
bitwise AND operation or not, Taman is asked to find maximum value among all (a AND xi) where
1  i  N . But their youngest sister Tamanna is not happy with this. She adds another condition that
for a given sequence, Taman has to answer Q queries instead of just one. Can you help poor Taman?

Note: Expression x AND y means applying the operation of bitwise AND to numbers x and y. This
operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in language C++ and Java it is
marked as &.
```

## Output

```
First line of input will contain the number of test cases, T  5. Then T test cases follow. First line of
each test case contains two integers N (1  N  100000) and Q (1  Q  30000) separated by a single
space. Next line contains N integers x1, x2, . . . , xn separated by a single space (0  xi < 109). Each of
next Q lines describes a query which consists of a single integer a (0  a < 230).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each query output a single integer, the maximum value of (a AND xi) where 1  i  N .
