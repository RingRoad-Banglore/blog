## Input

```text
As with most team sports, certain statistics can be accumulated during play. For this problem, you are
to write a program that reads play descriptions for a volleyball game and produces a report of player
and team statistics for one of the teams.

Your program will read in a series of input lines that describe a play of a volleyball game. Table
1 lists the types of plays that your program will use for input.

Key Play Play Description
C CHECKIN An indication of the beginning of a new game. The beginning

of any game will contain one CHECKIN play that lists all
the players in the game from one team.

H HIT A hit that was successfully defended by the opponent.
K KILL A hit that was not successfully defended by the opponent.
E ERR An erroneous hit that went into the net or out of bounds.
B BLOCK A successful defense of a hit at the net.
D DIG A successful defense of a hit behind the net.
R REPORT Command to your program to generate a report. After gen-

erating a report, your program should discard all collected
play records and begin processing anew on the rest of the
input file.

Table 1: Real-Time Plays

Each play (except CHECKIN and REPORT) has exactly one 2-digit player number associated with
it. Player digit numbers are limited to 0 through 5 allowing referees to indicate player numbers using
0 to 5 fingers off of each hand.

Your program is to compute the following statistics for each player that has participated in any
game as well as statistics for the entire team. Descriptions of all statistics that your program is to
compute from the collected plays are listed in Table 2.

Label Formula Description Sample
Hit % (sum(KILL) sum(ERR))/ Hitting percentage 0.461

(sum(KILL) + sum(ERR) + sum(HIT ))

KPG sum(KILL)/#Games Kills per game 5.613
BPG sum(BLOCK)/#Games Blocks per game 3.100
DPG sum(DIG)/#Games Digs per game 2.050

Table 2: Computed Statistics
```

## Output

```text
Input to your program will consist of a series of input lines each with exactly one play. Column 1 will
contain one of the play keys from Table 1. If the play is a REPORT, there is no additional input on
the line.

If the play is a CHECKIN, there will be a blank in column 2, followed by a single integer (06 
NP  15) in columns 3 and 4 which indicates the number of players participating in the game. The
remainder of the line contains a series of 2-digit (including leading zeros) player numbers (each with

exactly 1 preceding blank) indicating the players who participated in the game. You can be confident
that the CHECKIN is accurate and that no player will be mentioned in any play in that game who
does not appear on the preceding CHECKIN line.

For the plays HIT, KILL, ERR, BLOCK, and DIG, there will be blank in column 2 and exactly one
player number (including leading a leading zero as required) in columns 3 and 4.

Note: Read the sample input below by columns. The C lines appears splited here by formating
reasons.

## Sample Input

```text
Each time your program reads in a REPORT play, you should print a report with the following
format.

The first two lines of each report must contain the following strings each starting in column 1.

Player Hit Pct KPG BPG DPG
-----------------------------------------

Your program should then print, for each player who has played in at least one game, a single line
in the following format:

55 s0.000 99.999 99.999 99.999

with the lines in ascending order of player number. In the player report line, s is the sign of the hitting
percentages and is + if the hitting percentage  0.000 and is - otherwise. Note the hitting percentage
should be 0.000 if the user has not made any hits, kills, nor errors.

After printing a report for each player, your program should print a single line containing the team
statistics in the following format.

team s0.000 99.999 99.999 99.999

You can be confident that no statistics magnitude will exceed 99.999 in value. After printing the
team statistics, your program should print exactly one blank line.
