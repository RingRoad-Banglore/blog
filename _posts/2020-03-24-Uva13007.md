## Input

```
Daedalus is playing the game of Dont be greedy, in which N players sit around a table having each
of them five cards labelled 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 points. In Dont be greedy the players may not
talk to each other once the game starts, and there are M rounds. In each round, the bank announces a
budget B. Then each player chooses one of the cards and places it, face down, on the table. The bank
then turns the cards, so that all players can see all N cards. If the sum of the points in the chosen
cards is less than or equal to B, then the bank gives to each player exactly the amount of points in the
card he or she chose. Otherwise, no one gets anything. Each player gets his or her card back before the
next round. The players are very rational and would like to maximize their points and minimize their
regrets! What would you do in this situation? Cooperate or defect?

Take the following table as an example. Daedalus won a total of 10 points, in the end, because
only the first round was successful. But, looking back on the game, he sees that he could have won
110 points, if he had chosen 100 points in the first round and 10 points in the third round. That is,
Daedalus could have won 100 extra points! This holds only, of course, assuming the cards chosen by
the other players remain unchanged.

round budget B Daedalus Iapyx Icarus Ariadne Minos sum result
1 300 10 100 10 1 10 131 success
2 1100 100 10 100 1 1000 1211 fail
3 1200 100 100 10 1 1000 1211 fail

Given the budget and the cards chosen in each round, we need to compute the maximum total
number of extra points Daedalus could have won, in the end, if he had chosen the best possible card in
each round, assuming the cards chosen by the other players remain unchanged.

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases; each test case is formatted as follows. The first line contains
two integers N and M , representing respectively the number of players and the number of rounds
(1  N  20 and 1  M  50). Each of the next M lines describes a round with an integer B
indicating the budget (1  B  106), followed by N integers C1, C2, , CN representing that the
i-th player chose the card labelled with Ci points during that round (Ci  {1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000} for
i = 1, 2, . . . , N). Daedalus is the first player.

extra points Daedalus could have won, if he had chosen the best possible card in each round, assuming
the cards chosen by the other players remain unchanged.
