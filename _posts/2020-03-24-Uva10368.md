title: Uva 10368  Euclids Game
---


## Input

```text
Two players, Stan and Ollie, play, starting with
two natural numbers. Stan, the first player,
subtracts any positive multiple of the lesser of
the two numbers from the greater of the two
numbers, provided that the resulting number
must be nonnegative. Then Ollie, the second
player, does the same with the two resulting
numbers, then Stan, etc., alternately, until one
player is able to subtract a multiple of the
lesser number from the greater to reach 0, and
thereby wins. For example, the players may
start with (25,7):

25 7
11 7
4 7
4 3
1 3
1 0

and Stan wins.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of a number of lines. Each line contains two positive integers giving the starting two
numbers of the game. Stan always starts.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, output one line saying either Stan wins or Ollie wins assuming that both
of them play perfectly. The last line of input contains two zeroes and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Output

```text
34 12
15 24
0 0

```
