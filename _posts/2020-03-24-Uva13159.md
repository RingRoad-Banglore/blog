## Input

```text
Joao wants to join the robotic football team of his university.
However, since he knows little about robotics and mathematics,
he decided to build a 2-dimensional robotic arm to bootstrap his
knowledge.

The robotic arm is composed of N segments of various lengths.
The segments can form any angle between them, including config-
urations that make it appear to self-intersect when viewed from
above. The robotic arm works great, but it is not trivial to po-
sition the arms tip as close as possible to given x, y target coor-
dinates with so many joints to control. Can you help Joao?

Given the robotic arm description and target coordinates relative to the arms origin, calculate a
configuration that places the arms tip as close as possible to the target.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line contains N , the number of segments composing the robotic arm. N lines follow, each

with an integer Li describing the length of the i-th segment from the fixed point until the arms tip.
There is one more line with 2 integers: the x, y coordinates of the target point to reach.

Constraints
1  N  20 Number of segments in the robotic arm
1  Li  1 000 Length of the i-th segment

20 000  x, y  20 000 Target coordinates to attempt to reach

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The output should contain N lines, each containing two real numbers xi, yi indicating the coordi-

nates of the tip of the i-th segment.
The length of the i-th segment computed from the solution and input Li may not differ by more

than 0.01. Similarly, the absolute error between the solutions distance to the target and the minimum
possible distance to the target cannot exceed 0.01.

Note that, in general, there are many solutions. Your program may output any of them.

Sample Explanation: The pictures below show 2 different solutions for the first sample input and 1
solution for second.
