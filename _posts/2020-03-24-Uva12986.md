title: Uva 12986  The Battle of Guandu
---


```
In the year of 200, two generals whose names are Cao Cao and Shao Yuan are fighting in Guandu. The
battle of Guandu was a great battle and the two armies were fighting at M different battlefields whose
numbers were 1 to M . There were also N villages nearby numbered from 1 to N . Cao Cao could train
some warriors from those villages to strengthen his military. For village i, Cao Cao could only call for
some number of warriors join the battlefield xi. However, Shao Yuans power was extremely strong at
that time. So in order to protect themselves, village i would also send equal number of warriors to
battlefield yi and join the Yuan Shaos Army. If Cao Cao had called for one warrior from village i, he
would have to pay ci units of money for the village. There was no need for Cao Cao to pay for the
warriors who would join Shao Yuans army. At the beginning, there were no warriors of both sides in
every battlefield.

As one of greatest strategist at that time, Cao Cao was considering how to beat Shao Yuan. As we
can image, the battlefields would have different level of importance wi. Some of the battlefields with
wi = 2 were very important, so Cao Cao had to guarantee that in these battlefields, the number of his
warriors was greater than Shao Yuans. And some of the battlefields with wi = 1 were not as important
as before, so Cao Cao had to make sure that the number of his warriors was greater or equal to Shao
Yuans. The other battlefields with wi = 0 had no importance, so there were no restriction about the
number of warriors in those battlefields. Now, given such conditions, could you help Cao Cao find the
least number of money he had to pay to win the battlefield?

## Input

```
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T (1  T  30). T test cases follow.

Each test case begins with two integers N and M (1  N,M  105) in one line.
The second line contains N integers separated by blanks. The ith integer xi (1  xi  M) means

Cao Cao could call for warriors from village i to battlefield xi.
The third line also contains N integers separated by blanks. The i-th integer yi (1  yi  M) means

if Cao Cao called some number of warriors from village i, there would be the same number of warriors
join Shao Yuans army and fight in battlefield yi.

The next line contains N integers separated by blanks. The i-th integer ci (0  ci  105) means
the number of money Cao Cao had to pay for each warrior from this village.

The last line contains M integers separated by blanks. The i-th number wi (wi  {0, 1, 2}) means
the importance level of ith battlefield.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting
from 1) and y is the least amount of money that Cao Cao had to pay for all the warriors to win the
