title: Uva 00350  Pseudo-Random Numbers
---


## Input

```text
Computers normally cannot generate really random numbers, but frequently are used to generate
sequences of pseudo-random numbers. These are generated by some algorithm, but appear for all
practical purposes to be really random. Random numbers are used in many applications, including
simulation.

A common pseudo-random number generation technique is called the linear congruential method.
If the last pseudo-random number generated was L, then the next number is generated by evaluating
(Z  L+ I) mod M , where Z is a constant multiplier, I is a constant increment, and M is a constant
modulus. For example, suppose Z is 7, I is 5, and M is 12. If the first random number (usually called
the seed) is 4, then we can determine the next few pseudo-random numbers are follows:

Last Random Number, L (Z  L+ I) Next Random Number, (Z  L+ I) mod M
4 33 9
9 68 8
8 61 1
1 12 0
0 5 5
5 40 4

As you can see, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers generated by this technique repeats after
six numbers. It should be clear that the longest sequence that can be generated using this technique is
limited by the modulus, M .

In this problem you will be given sets of values for Z, I, M , and the seed, L. Each of these will
have no more than four digits. For each such set of values you are to determine the length of the cycle
of pseudo-random numbers that will be generated. But be careful: the cycle might not begin with the
seed!
```

## Output

```text
Each input line will contain four integer values, in order, for Z, I, M , and L. The last line will contain
four zeroes, and marks the end of the input data. L will be less than M .

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input line, display the case number (they are sequentially numbered, starting with 1) and the
length of the sequence of pseudo-random numbers before the sequence is repeated.

```

## Sample Output

```text
