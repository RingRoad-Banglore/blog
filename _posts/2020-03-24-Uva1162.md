A company wants to hire a new employee. The selection process consists of several attention tests,
one of them consists in: each candidate must type each character he sees in a flashing screen, using
a given keyboard. You are asked to write down a program to score the candidates, given the original
sequence of characters, and what the candidate actually typed. Scoring is based on the kind of actions
the candidate may perform. For each character flashing in the screen, she may only:

1. Correctly type the character;

2. Omit the character;

3. By mistake, type a different character.

The score or penalty given to each action depends on the keyboard layout considered. The keyboard
is a matrix of n rows and m columns.

The distance between the characters at coordinates (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) is given by the maximum
of |i1  i2| and |j1  j2|. For example, in the keyboard below (3 rows by 5 columns), the distance
between the character a, at (2,1), and the character h at (3,5) is 4, and the distance between the
character o and h is 2. In this example, the largest distance between any two characters is 4. For
any keyboard the largest distance between any two characters is conventionally referred to by TOP.

The score given to the correct transcription of one character is TOP+1. The penalty given for
the omission of one character (action 2) is TOP+1. The score given for changing a character for
another (action 3) is TOP+1 minus the distance between the two characters involved in the mistake.
For example, considering the keyboard shown above, the following action scores apply: Score for the
correct transcript of one character: 5; Penalty for the omission of one character: 5; Score for changing
character o to character h: 5-2=3.

A scoring of a test is the sum of the scores given to each character typed minus the sum of the
penalties for each character omitted. Since the scoring is only done after the test finishes, it is not
possible to be sure about when specific actions were realized (e.g, did the candidate skip a character, or
mistyped it?). To avoid complaints, the final score given is the highest possible value for scoring
the candidate, according to the rules explained above. For example, if the text to transcribe is time
and the candidate types yme, we may score it in several ways:

To omit t, change i for y and correctly transcribe m and e;

To change t for y, omit i and correctly transcribe m and e;

To change t for y, change i for m, omit m and correctly transcribe e;

To change t for y, change i for m, change m for e and omit e.

Each one of these possibilities has one score associated (9, 8, 7, and 3 points, respectively). Thus,
the candidates final score is 9 points. Write a program that, considering the shape of a keyboard, the
text to be transcribed by the candidate, and the actual transcript produced by the candidate returns
the final score of the candidate.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line contains an integer N , stating the number of rows in the keyboard. The next N lines,

all with the same length, contain a string with the sequence of characters in the corresponding keyboard
row. The keyboard will not have more than 20 rows and 30 columns. Then, the next two lines contains
the text to be transcribed by the candidate, and the text typed by the candidate. These texts will be
no longer than 500 characters each.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
A single line containing an integer stating the final score of the candidate.
