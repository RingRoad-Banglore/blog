10105 Polynomial coefficients
The problem is to calculate the coefficients in expansion of polynomial (x1 + x2 + . . .+ xk)n.

## Input
The input will consist of a set of pairs of lines. The first line of the pair consists of two integers n and
k separated with space (0 < K,N < 13). This integers define the power of the polynomial and the
amount of the variables. The second line in each pair consists of k non-negative integers n1, . . . , nk,
where n1 + . . .+ nk = n.

## Output
For each input pair of lines the output line should consist one integer, the coefficient by the monomial
xn11 x
