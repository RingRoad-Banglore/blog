title: Uva 00267  Off Course
---


```
Fat Chance Airlines has had several of their aircraft stray off course within the last few months. After
the last error nearly put an aircraft over the enemys airspace, an investigation has shown that their
navigation techniques do not take the wind speed and direction into account properly.

In order to make life easier on their novice navigators, the airline has contracted with your team to
produce a program that will provide the pilot with the proper heading for the aircraft, given a desired
course and wind velocity.

For each ight segment, you will be given the desired course, the true air speed (the speed relative
to the air) of the aircraft, the wind speed, and the direction the wind is blowing from. The pilot needs
the heading to which she should steer the aircraft and the effective ground speed (the speed at which
the aircraft is moving over the desired course relative to the ground).

All speeds will be given in knots, and all directions will be given in degrees (0  x < 360, with
0= north, 90= east, 180= south, 270= west).
```

## Input

```
Input to your program will consist of a series of flight segments, one per line terminated by an end-of-
file. Each line will consist of the wind speed, the wind direction, the desired course, and the true air
speed, all given as free-format oating point numbers separated from each other by a single space.

```

## Output

```
Your program should produce for every line segment in the input file, including the last one, six lines
followed by a blank line. Each of the six lines is labeled as in the example below. The first four lines
reproduce the input numbers. The remaining two lines show the heading and effective ground speed
calculated for each segment.

Use a format analogous to the sample below. Each number must be accurate to 1/100th.

Warning: Output should not contain -0.00 or 360.00 values for direction, or -0.00 value for speed.
