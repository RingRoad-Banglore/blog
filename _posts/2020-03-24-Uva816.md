```
The 1999 World Finals Contest included a problem based on a dice maze. At the time the problem
was written, the judges were unable to discover the original source of the dice maze concept. Shortly
after the contest, however, Mr. Robert Abbott, the creator of numerous mazes and an author on the
subject, contacted the contest judges and identified himself as the originator of dice mazes. We regret
that we did not credit Mr. Abbott for his original concept in last years problem statement. But we
are happy to report that Mr. Abbott has offered his expertise to this years contest with his original
and unpublished walk-through arrow mazes.

As are most mazes, a walk-through arrow maze is traversed by moving from intersection to inter-
section until the goal intersection is reached. As each intersection is approached from a given direction,
a sign near the entry to the intersection indicates in which directions the intersection can be exited.
These directions are always left, forward or right, or any combination of these.

Figure 1 illustrates a walk-through arrow maze. The intersections are identified as (row, column)
pairs, with the upper left being (1,1). The Entrance intersection for Figure 1 is (3,1), and the Goal
intersection is (3,3). You begin the maze by moving north from (3,1). As you walk from (3,1) to (2,1),
the sign at (2,1) indicates that as you approach (2,1) from the south (traveling north) you may continue
to go only forward. Continuing forward takes you toward (1,1). The sign at (1,1) as you approach from
the south indicates that you may exit (1,1) only by making a right. This turns you to the east now
walking from (1,1) toward (1,2). So far there have been no choices to be made. This is also the case as
you continue to move from (1,2) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (1,3). Now, however, as you move west from (1,3)
toward (1,2), you have the option of continuing straight or turning left. Continuing straight would take
you on toward (1,1), while turning left would take you south to (2,2). The actual (unique) solution to
this maze is the following sequence of intersections: (3,1) (2,1) (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (2,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1)
(2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3).

You must write a program to solve valid walk-through arrow mazes. Solving a maze means (if
possible) finding a route through the maze that leaves the Entrance in the prescribed direction, and
ends in the Goal. This route should not be longer than necessary, of course.

## Input

```
The input file will consist of one or more arrow mazes. The first line of each maze description contains
the name of the maze, which is an alphanumeric string of no more than 20 characters. The next line
contains, in the following order, the starting row, the starting column, the starting direction, the goal
row, and finally the goal column. All are delimited by a single space. The maximum dimensions of
a maze for this problem are 9 by 9, so all row and column numbers are single digits from 1 to 9.
The starting direction is one of the characters N, S, E or W, indicating north, south, east and west,
respectively.

All remaining input lines for a maze have this format: two integers, one or more groups of characters,
and a sentinel asterisk, again all delimited by a single space. The integers represent the row and column,
respectively, of a maze intersection. Each character group represents a sign at that intersection. The
first character in the group is N, S, E or W to indicate in what direction of travel the sign would be
seen. For example, S indicates that this is the sign that is seen when travelling south. (This is the
sign posted at the north entrance to the intersection.) Following this first direction character are one
to three arrow characters. These can be L, F or R indicating left, forward, and right, respectively.

The list of intersections is concluded by a line containing a single zero in the first column. The next
line of the input starts the next maze, and so on. The end of input is the word END on a single line by
itself.

## Output

```
For each maze, the output file should contain a line with the name of the maze, followed by one or more
lines with either a solution to the maze or the phrase No Solution Possible. Maze names should
start in column 1, and all other lines should start in column 3, i.e., indented two spaces. Solutions
should be output as a list of intersections in the format (R,C) in the order they are visited from the
start to the goal, should be delimited by a single space, and all but the last line of the solution should
contain exactly 10 intersections.

Note:

Figure 2: Robert Abbotts Atlanta Maze

Robert Abbotts walk-through arrow mazes
are actually intended for large-scale construc-
tion, not paper. Although his mazes are unpub-
lished, some of them have actually been built.
One of these is on display at an Atlanta mu-
seum. Others have been constructed by the
American Maze Company over the past two
summers. As their name suggests these mazes
are intended to be walked through.

For the adventurous, Figure 2 a graphic of
Robert Abbotts Atlanta maze. Solving it is
quite difficult, even when you have an overview
of the entire maze. Imagine trying to solve this
by actually walking through the maze and only
seeing one sign at a time! Robert Abbott him-
self indicated that the maze is too complex and
most people give up before finishing. Among
the people that did not give up was Donald
Knuth: it took him about thirty minutes to
solve the maze.
