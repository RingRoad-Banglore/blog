title: Uva 11133  Eigensequence
---


## Input

```text
Given an increasing sequence of integers a1, a2, a3, . . . , ak, the E-transform produces a sequence of the
same length, b1, b2, b3, . . . , bk such that

 b1 = a1

 for j > 1, bj is the only integer aj1 < bj  aj , which is divisible byaj  aj1.

For example, from S = 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 one gets E(S) = 0, 1, 3, 5, 14, 18, 33, 39.
A sequence S such that E(S) = S is called an eigensequence.
For instance, S = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20 is an eigensequence.

Given integers a1 and an, how many eigensequences (of any length) start with a1 and end with an?
```

## Output

```text
Input has many data lines, followed by a terminating line. Each line has two integers, a1 and an. If
a1 < n, its a data line. Otherwise its a terminating line that should not be processed. On each line,
0  a1  an  44. This guarantees that each output fits into 32 bit integer.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each data line, print a line with a1, an, and x, where x is the number of eigensequences (of any
length) that start with a1 and end with an.

```

## Sample Output

```text
0 3
5 7
2 8
0 0

```
