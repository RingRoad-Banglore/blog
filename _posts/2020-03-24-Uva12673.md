## Input

```text

Your favorite football team is playing a charity tournament, which is part of a worldwide fundraising
effort to help children with disabilities. As in a normal tournament, three points are awarded to the
team winning a match, with no points to the losing team. If the game is drawn, each team receives one
point.

Your team played N matches during the first phase of the tournament, which has just finished.
Only some teams, the ones with more accumulated points, will advance to the second phase of the
tournament. However, as the main objective of the tournament is to raise money, before the set of
teams that will pass to the second phase is determined, each team is allowed to buy additional goals.
These new goals count as normally scored goals, and may be used to alter the result of any of the
matches the team played.

Your teams budget is enough to buy up to G goals. Can you tell the maximum total number of
points your team can get after buying the goals, supposing the other teams will not buy any goals?
```

the goals your team scored and received on that match before buying goals.
