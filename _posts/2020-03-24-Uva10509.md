## Input

```
Richard P. Feynman was a musician, artist, scientist, teacher and No-
bel lauriet. He contributed to the development of the atomic bomb,
expanded the understanding of quantumelectrodynamics, translated
Mayan hieroglyphics, and cut to the heart of the Challenger disaster.
But beyond all of that, Richard Feynman was a unique and multi-
faceted individual and he was famous for his unbelievable stories, un-
usual life style and his popular books and lectures on mathematics and
physics.

Once, in Brazil, Feynman got into a kind of a competition with a
native to see who could do faster simple aritmethics, Feynman or an
abacus (aka an manual calculator machine)! Feynman lost in oper-
ations such as addition and multiplication but he won in cubic roots.
Given the number 1729.03 he got the result of 12.002 at the end of a
few seconds while his oponent got 12.0!

The analog procedure to the Square Root is:


n = a+ dx (1)

 n = (a+ dx)2

 n = a2 + 2  a  dx+ (dx)2

 n = a2 + 2  a  dx
 dx = 1/2  (n a2)/a

Considering an square of side a, with area a  a, if you
do a small increment of dx on each side , you will get a
square with area of the square with side a (Light gray) plus
the area of the two small rips (Medium Gray) on top plus
the area of the small square(dark gray). Since this is only
an approximated method, we can ignore this small area

((dx)2). Then just get value of dx, and substitute in (1).

Example
To calculate square root of 17, as Feynman has an excelent memory, he knows all perfect squares

(as well cubes), he knows that 4  4 = 16 then he just use the method above and calculate 4+ 1/8 that
equals 4.125 (not very bad as square root of 17 = 4.123...)

As Feynman is very lazy, and he doesnt like subtractions at all, he doesnt use negative dx (its
boring.. )

Your Task is to generalize this procedure to the cubic root, and HELP FEYNMAN! (Just do it,
What do you care what other people think?)

## Output

```
The input contains a positive floating-point number per line in the inteval [1 . . . 1000000] (inclusive).
The last line of the input file contains a number 0 (zero). This zero should not be processed.
