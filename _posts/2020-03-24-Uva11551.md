## Input

```text
Alice is given a list of integers by Bob and is asked to generate a new list where each element in the
new list is the sum of some other integers in the original list. The task is slightly more involved, as Bob
also asks Alice to repeat this several times before giving him the result. Help Alice automate her task.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input is t (1  t  10), the number of cases to follow. Each case is in the following
format:

n r
a0 a1 . . . an1
x0 b0,0 b0,1 . . . b0,x01
x1 b1,0 b1,1 . . . b1,x11
...
xn1 bn1,0 bn1,1 . . . bn1,xn11

Each case begins with the integer n (1  n  50), which is the number of elements in the list of
integers that Alice is given. The integer r (1  r  109) is the number of times these operations are to
be repeated on a list before returning the result. The values are the nonnegative integers in the original
list. Then n lines follow that define how Alice will generate a new list from a previous one. Each of
these lines are in the form:

xi bi,0 bi,1 . . . b1,xi

This line defines the value of the i-th element in the new list to be the sum of elements:

abi,0 , abi,1 , . . . , ab1,xi1

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of t lines, one line for each test case listing the final list of integers modulo 1000 in
the form:

c0 c1 . . . cn1

```

## Sample Output

```text
