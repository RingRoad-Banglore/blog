```
Recently, the organizers of the International Conference on Functional Programming had a program-
ming contest for people to show that their language was best. The contest main web page is at
http://www.ai.mit.edu/extra/icfp-contest/. Each entrant had to write an implementation of the
game pouse, for which the description went as follows:

Description of the game
The name of the game is pousse (which is French for push). It is a 2 person game, played on an N
by N board (the original game was 4 4 but N N is a simple generalisation to adjust the difficulty
of the game, and its implementation). Initially the board is empty, and the players take turns inserting
one marker of their color (X or O) on the board. The color X always goes first. The columns and
rows are numbered from 1 to N , starting from the top left, as in:

1 2 3 4
+-+-+-+-+

1 | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+

2 | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+

3 | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+

4 | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+

A marker can only be inserted on the board by sliding it onto a particular row from the left or from
the right, or onto a particular column from the top or from the bottom. So there are 4  N possible
moves (ways to insert a marker). They will be named Li, Ri, Ti, Bi respectively, where i is the
number of the row or column where the insertion takes place.

When a marker is inserted, there may be a marker on the square where the insertion takes place.
In this case, all markers on the insertion row or column from the insertion square upto the first empty
square are moved one square further to make room for the inserted marker. Note that the last marker
of the row or column will be pushed off the board (and must be removed from play) if there are no
empty squares on the insertion row or column.

A row or a column is a straight of a given color, if it contains N markers of the given color.
The game ends when an insertion creates a configuration with more straights of one color than

straights of the other color; the player whose color is dominant (in number of straights) WINS.

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The standard input of the program will contain a number N  100 on the first line and this will be
followed by a sequence of moves (in the notation previously described) with one move per line. There
are no intervening spaces or empty lines.

The program can assume that all moves in the sequence are valid.

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The organizers then want to play one submitted program against the others to see which is best.
So they need to know when one program wins.

Your job is to write a program to determine when a game has been won. The input to your program
is the same as described above: an initial number followed by a sequence of moves. As soon as a move
produces a winning board position, your program should print out whether X WINS or O WINS, and
exit. If a line containing QUIT is read before a winner is declared, your program should print out TIE
GAME and exit. As a failsafe, the last line of every input will be a QUIT line.
