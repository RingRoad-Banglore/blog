title: Uva 11746  Finding the Transmitter Again
---


## Input

```
SOS! Your boss has misplaced an impor-
tant (and expensive) radio transmitter
somewhere in a large, rectangular corn-
patch. He refuses to explain why he took
the transmitter out into the cornpatch,
but he has tasked you with finding it.
Thankfully, he has already set up three
radio receivers in the cornpatch to help
you narrow down the possible locations
to search.

The receivers are designed in such a
way that they can only measure the signal
strength at their location, and not which
direction it is coming from. Furthermore,
they are too large to easily move.

You know that for this particular
model of transmitter, the signal strength
at a positive distance d is given by the expression P/d2, where P is the power level of the transmitter.
Unfortunately, you dont know what power level the transmitter is currently set to, only that it is
positive.

Write a program that reads as input the locations and readings of the receivers, and outputs a list
of possible locations of the transmitter.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a number N on a single line, followed by N testcases.

Each testcase consists of three lines, each containing the location (as two integers xi yi) and power
reading (as an integer pi) from one of the receivers. You are assured that 0  xi, yi  1, 000, 0 < pi 
100, 000, and that the receivers are located at three distinct points.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each testcase, output one line containing first the number of possible locations of the transmitter,
followed by the possible locations themselves (in the form xt yt). A location is possible if it is within
the cornpatch (0  xt, yt  1, 000), and a transmitter there could produce the given receiver readings
for some positive power level P .

The output coordinates should be rounded to exactly two decimal places, and multiple output
locations should be sorted by increasing x-coordinate, breaking ties by increasing y-coordinate. You
are guaranteed that the input data will determine a finite, non-zero number of possible locations.
Furthermore, the input will be such that a small perturbation (on the order of 106) in the receiver
positions would not change the number of possible locations.
