title: Uva 11841  Ygame
---


## Input

```
Willy and Benny enjoy very much playing Y-game! This is a game in which white and black tokens are
placed on a triangular n-grid, n  0, where n is called the order of the grid. A 3-grid is depicted in the
figure below:

In general, an n-grid has (n+2)(n+1)/2 points with nonnegative baricentric coordinates (x, y, z),
where x + y + z = n. Coordinates in a n-grid are assigned in such way that along right to left paths
x-coodinates are constant, y-coordinates increase by one unit, and z-coordinates decrease by one unit
(observe that this construction maintains x+ y + z = n true). Symmetric situations may be observed
for left to right (where y-coordinates are constant) and horizontal (where z-coordinates are constant)
paths. A point (x, y, z) in a n-grid is said to lay on the x side (resp., y side, z side) if and only if x = 0
(resp., y = 0, z = 0).

Willy uses white tokens and Benny uses black ones. Y-game rules are rather complicated, but the
end of the game is attained when there is a token placed on every node of the grid. The winner is that
player that has formed a Y, that is, his/her tokens are so placed that they include a connected set of
points with a point on each side. For example, the following figure represents an end situation where
Benny wins:

The winner is rather easy to determine when the grid is small. But Willy and Benny are not
interested in that discussion today. Actually, they just want a software solution that computes the
winner of ended Y -games. Could you help them?

## Output

```
The problem input consists of several cases. A case begins with a line with two integer numbers, n and
m, where n is the order of the grid and m the number of positions that have a black-coloured token
(Bennys tokens), with 0  n  20 and 0  m  (n+ 2)(n+ 1)/2.

Then, m lines follow, each one with 3 values x, y and z representing coordinate (x, y, z) of a point
in the n-grid with a black token. Values on each input line are separated by one or more spaces.

The end of the input is signaled by a line

## Sample Input

```
Output texts for each input case are presented in the same order that the input is read. For an input
case in the puzzle statement, the output should be a single line with the left-justified text

Willy

or

Benny

accordingly to the fact that Willy or, respectively, Benny wins in that case.
