title: Uva 01178  The Juice Shop
---


## Input

```text
Jashim runs a juice shop near the university campus. Students buy their weekly juice stock from his
shop. Every morning juice producers bring their supplies to his shop in jars of two different sizes. Each
of these jars can contain a particular volume (expressed in liter) of juice and has marks to indicate
that volume. The suppliers have jars of different volumes and jars given today are not necessarily the
same in volume as those given yesterday. Had the shop been at some other location, Jashim wouldnt
have faced any difficulty with the jars, but the students like to buy the smallest volume of juice Jashim
is ready to provide. So, every morning, Jashim has to undergo a long process of making the smallest
volume of juice possible with the given jars.

Jashim doesnt have any measuring pot for direct measurement of volume. Rather he uses a very
large barrel (of almost infinite capacity) for this purpose. He takes one of the supplied jars and either
pours all the juice into the barrel or takes it out from the barrel into the supplied jar to jars full
capacity. The volume of juice transferred in any case is equal to the supplied jars capacity. In this way,
he uses both types of jar and pours juice into or takes it out of the barrel as many times as necessary
to get the minimum volume achievable by this mechanism. After, the minimum volume is prepared, he
uses this as measuring volume to sell juice of that volume. Now you are to help Jashim.

## Output

```text
Input file contains multiple cases. Each case contains two numbers m and n (1  n  m  2147483647)
where m and n are the volumes (in liter) of two types of supplied jars. So, you can pour m (or n) liters
of juice into the barrel and also take m (or n) liters of juice out of the barrel at each step. You are to
determine the minimum volume (in liter) achievable by this process. Besides, determine the minimum
number of times you are to pour in and take out from the barrel. Input terminates by a pair of 0s.
You need not process this last case.

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output consists of three lines. First line specifies the minimum volume achievable by this
process. Second line specifies the minimum number of times volume m has been poured into or taken
out from the barrel and third line specifies the same for volume n. If some volume need not be taken
out or poured in, print m (or n) liter(s) not needed. Print a blank line between successive cases.
Follow the format given in sample output.
