title: Uva 12997  Train Station
---


```
Not that long ago a new railway station was built at Rajshahi, a nice city in Bangladesh. The old one
was very small in size. After searching for a while I got a picture of the old station. As you can see
the station was mostly open ended in both sides back then. Current railway station is mostly closed in
the inner end. In closed end case, the advantage is, we always know where the train will stop and we
also know the location of the exit of the train station. So if you want to optimize your time, you can
cleverly choose the train bogie and thus exit the whole station at the earliest possible time.

However the situation is not that simple for open ended
train stations. The bogie may stop at anywhere at the
line. Well, not exactly anywhere, but if we travel for several
days we kind of know which bogie usually stops near the
exit. Under this circumstances, we would like to compute
expected amount of time one requires to exit the station.

For our convenience let us assume the width of a train
bogie is negligible and the train line is yaxis. Let the exit
of the train station be (x, 0). After traveling several days I
know which bogie I should ride. Suppose the length of that
bogie is d. We also know that the train randomly stops in
the station in such a way that the entire bogie is completely
within (0, y1) and (0, y2) [y1  y2  d]. A bogie has 2 exits, one at the very beginning and another at
very end. My sitting location is uniformly random within the bogie. However, when the train stops I
look outside through the window and decide which end of the bogie I should exit through to get out of
the station at the earliest possible time. If I can walk 1 unit distance per second, what is the expected
time for me to get out of the station?

## Input

```
First line of the input will be the number of test cases T ( 1, 000). Hence T test cases follow. Each
case consists of a single line with four integers: x, y1, y2, d [100  y1, y2  100, 0 < d, x  100,
y1  y2  d].

```

## Output

```
For each test case output: Case t: ans where t is the case number and ans is the expected amount
of time. Precision error of 104 will be accepted.

## Sample Input

1 1 -1 2
1 1 -1 1
1 10 8 1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 1.914214
Case 2: 1.382597
Case 3: 9.058678
