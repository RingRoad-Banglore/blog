title: Uva 13272  Bracket  Sequence
---


## Input

```
You are given a bracket sequence  B . The bracket
sequence may contain 4 types of brackets:

1. Round  brackets  (  or  )

2. Curly  brackets {  or  }

3. Square  brackets  [  or  ]

4. Angle  brackets  <  or  >

For each position in the bracket sequence B , you
need to output the length of the longest balanced con-
tiguous bracket sequence starting from (and includ-
ing) that particular  position.

Formally, a bracket sequence T is balanced if

 T  is  empty

  T   is (P) , [P] , {P} , <P>   where  P   is  a balanced 
 bracket  sequence

  T   is  PQ   where  P   and  Q  are  balanced bracket 
 sequences.

For example, for  B = (<>)>< , the answer is 4  2  0  0  0  0.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input will contain a single positive integer  T (T  10) denoting the number of test
cases. Hence  T cases follow. Each case is a single line of non-empty bracket sequence, containing only
 8 types of characters (, ), {, }, [, ], <, >. Each of these bracket sequences will not contain
more than  105   characters.

If it helps, most of the judge data is produced randomly. First a random bracket sequence (not
necessarily balanced) of certain length is generated. Say it is  X . Then we change X  by replacing some 
 substring  of  it  with  a  random  balanced  bracket  sequence  several  times.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output case number (no trailing space after  Case x: ), followed by the answers in
separate  line.  There  is  NO   empty  line  between  cases.  For  details,  please  see  the  sample.
