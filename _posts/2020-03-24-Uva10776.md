title: Uva 10776  Determine The combination
---


## Input

```text
Jahir is a student of NSU (Nice Students University). He hates the chapter Permutation & Combination
of the subject Discrete Math. But his teacher give him a assignment to generate all the r combination
of a string. But he is too busy with his new girlfriend to do the assignment himself. So he went to
Shabuj, a student of CSE (Calculation Science and Engineering) in BUET (Bangladesh University of
Extraordinary Talents). He asked him to make a program to generate the combinations. But Shabuj is
always lazy. He wants your help.

Your task is to print all different r combinations of a string s (a r combination of a string s is a
collection of exactly r letters from different positions in s).

There may be different permutations of the same combination; consider only the one that has its r
characters in non-decreasing order.

The string consists of only lowercase letters. Any letter can occur more than once.
```

## Output

```text
The input is consist of several test cases. Each test case consists of a string s (the length of s is between
1 and 30) and an integer r (0 < r  length of s).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case you have to print all different r combinations of s in lexicographic order in separate
line. You can assume there are at most 1000 different ones.

```

## Sample Output

```text
abcde 2
abcd 3
aba 2

```
