13071 Double decker
John D. Controller works in Tourist-o-Matic, a company that organizes sightseeing double decker buses
in Madrid. However, John’s job is very boring: he must check all the buses that leave the initial stop
and record how many tourists there are on each deck.

In order to make his job more enjoyable, he has created a little game. Instead of recording two
numbers for each bus, he only records a single natural number (called rank) that perfectly determines
the occupation of the bus. To calculate the rank, he distributes the buses by rows depending on the
total number of tourists (the rank is the number next to each bus):

John is not very good at maths, so he usually computes a wrong rank. Could you help him with a
program?

## Input
The first line contains the number A of buses that leave the initial stop. Then there are A lines with
the format N M , where N is the number of tourists on the upper deck and M the number of tourists
on the lower deck. The maximum occupation of each deck is 1,000.

## Output
For each bus, the program will write a line with its rank.

## Sample Input
<p>3</p><p>0 0</p><p>1 2</p><p>2 0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>1</p><p>8</p><p>6</p>
