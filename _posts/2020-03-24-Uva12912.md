title: Uva 12912  Josephus lottery
---


## Input

```
Professor Humbertov Moralov wants to make a raffle between the students of his Data Structure class
and Pepito (a student of this group) suggests to use the Josephus problem to determine who is the
winner of the raffle. The problem is that you can know beforehand the winning position if you know
the value of n (the total of students in the raffle) and the value k (the amount of movements before
throwing out a student from the circle).

The prize is kind of interesting, the winner wont have to take the final exam, and for that reason
the professor Humbertov proposes the following variant to the Josephus problem: Take the student
class list, in which the students are numbered from 1 to n, then, organize these numbers in a circle
and begin to count clockwise from number 1 to the value k. The student with number k in the list is
removed from the circle, and now you begin to count, now counterclockwise, from the number of the
next student (k + 1). The student with the number in which the count stopped is removed from the
circle, and then you repeat the process alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise, counting
until you get the winner of the raffle.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case has only one line, in which there are two positive
integers N (1  N  106) and K (1  K  N) that represents respectively, the number of students in
the raffle and the value of movements to remove students from the circle. The input ends with a case
containing two zeros, which must not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

For each test case you have to print the number in the student list that represents the winner of the
raffle.
