## Input

```
This is the story of a time long ago. There were these sailors stranded on a beautiful island full off
coconut trees. And what do our sailors do with the coconut trees? They collect all the coconuts and
divide those among themselves and the monkeys that they brought with them!

History tells us that there were S sailors on the island, and they collected C coconuts in total. At
nightfall they decided to leave the coconuts in a secret place and divide it equally in the morning. But
as the night grew darker, the sailors began to get impatient. At midnight, one of the sailors got up. He
dug up the coconuts and saw that after dividing the coconuts equally into S baskets, there are exactly
M coconuts left. These, as you must have guessed, goes to the M monkeys that they have brought
with them. Now, our greedy sailor took one of those baskets for himself and left the remaining S  1
ones for his commodores. History repeats. So we have another sailor succumbing to the temptation of
juicy coconuts. He again, divided the remaining coconuts equally in S baskets only to find M coconuts
extra. One basket for himself, M coconuts for the M monkeys and the remaining S  1 baskets for his
fellows  thats how it goes.

Before the night was over each and every sailor played his part exactly once. At dawn when they
started to divide the remaining coconuts, they found that theres no extra coconut left for the monkeys.
But the monkeys would not complain, nor would any of the sailors. They had their share alright.

Historians, as one would expect, can be trusted for facts not for the figures. So whatever they would
say about the values of S, C and M cannot be trusted entirely. But given the values of S, M and
an interval for C one can identify possible values for C. As a programmer you only need to count the
number of valid C values on a given range [low, high] inclusive.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input gives you the number of test cases, T (1  T  15). Then T test cases follow.
Each of the test cases consists of four integers and is presented one in each line. The first integer gives
you the number of sailors S (1 < S  100), then the next integer gives you the number of monkeys M
(0  M < S). The next two integers will give you the value of low and high (0  low  high  108).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each of the test cases, you need to print one line of output. The output for each test case starts
with the test case number, followed by the number of valid C values in the range [low, high]. For the
exact format of output, please consult the sample input/output section.

Illustration: The first test case gives you 3 sailors, 2 monkeys and a range of [49, 50] to choose from.
If youd try to do the math in hand, youd see that only 50 would satisfy the scenario. So the answer
for the first test case has to be 1. Heres the brief illustration:

Sailor # Total Coconuts His share Monkeys share Remaining Coconuts
1 50 16 2 32
2 32 10 2 20
3 20 6 2 12

```

## Sample Output

```

3 2 49 50
4 2 5 10000
