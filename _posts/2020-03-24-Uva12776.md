title: Uva 12776  Query for Divisorfree Numbers
---


## Input

```

You are given an array of N integers: A1, A2, . . . , AN . You have to process Q queries on this array,
where a query will be a pair of integers (L,R).

For each query, you have to find the count of Divisor-free numbers in the number sequence S, where
S = AL, AL+1, . . . , AR. A number Ai from the sequence S will be called Divisor-free if there is no Aj
(i = j) in S such that Aj is a divisor Ai.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T (T  5) denoting the number of test cases. The first
line of each test case contains two integers N and Q (1  N,Q  105). The following line contains N
space separated integers A1, A2, . . . , AN where 1  Ai  106. In each of the next Q lines, there will
be two integers (L,R) representing a query (1  L  R  N).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number in the format Case X: (here, X is the serial of the test
case). Then print Q lines containing the answer for each query.
