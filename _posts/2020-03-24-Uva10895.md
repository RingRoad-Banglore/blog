## Input

```
A matrix is a rectangular array of elements, most commonly numbers. A matrix with m rows and n
columns is said to be an m-by-n matrix. For example,

A =




1 3 2
0 4 1
0 0 0
5 2 11




is a 4-by-3 matrix of integers.
The individual elements of a matrix are usually given lowercase symbols and are distinguished by

subscripts. The ith row and jth column of matrix A is usually referred to as aij . For example, a23 = 1.
Matrix subscripts are 1-based.

The transpose of a matrix M , denoted MT , is formed by interchanging the rows and columns of M .
That is, the ij-th element of MT is the ji-th element of M . For example, the transpose of matrix A
above is:

AT =


 1 0 0 53 4 0 2

2 1 0 11




A matrix is said to be sparse if there are relatively few non-zero elements. As a m-by-n matrix has
mn number of elements, storing all elements of a large sparse matrix may be inefficient as there would
be many zeroes. There are a number of ways to represent sparse matrices, but essentially they are all
the same: store only the non-zero elements of the matrix along with their row and column.

You are to write a program to output the transpose of a sparse matrix of integers.
```

## Output

```
You are given several sparse matrix in a row, each of them described as follows. The first line of the
input corresponds to the dimension of the matrix, m and n (which are the number of rows and columns,
respectively, of the matrix). You are then given m sets of numbers, which represent the rows of the
matrix. Each set consists of two lines which represents a row of the matrix. The first line of a set starts
with the number r, which is the number of non-zero elements in that row, followed by r numbers which
correspond to the column indices of the non-zero elements in that row, in ascending order; the second
line has r integers which are the matrix elements of that row. For example, matrix A above would have
the following representation:

4 3
3 1 2 3
1 3 2
2 2 3
4 -1
0

3 1 2 3
5 -2 11

Note that for a row with all zero elements, the corresponding set would just be one number, 0, in
the first line, followed by a blank line.

You may assume:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10895  Matrix Transpose 2/2

 the dimension of the sparse matrix would not exceed 10000-by-10000,

 the number of non-zero element would be no more than 1000,

 each element of the matrix would be in the range of -10000 to 10000, and

 each line has no more than 79 characters.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each input case, the transpose of the given matrix in the same representation.
