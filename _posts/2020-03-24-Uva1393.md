## Input

```text

Hackerland is a happy democratic country with mn cities, arranged in a rectangular m by n grid and
connected by m roads in the east-west direction and n roads in the north-south direction. By public
demand, this orthogonal road system is to be supplemented by a system of highways in sucha way
that there will be a direct connection between any pair of cities. Each highway is a straight line going
through two or more cities. If two cities lie on the same highway, then they are directly connected.If two
cities are in the same row or column, then they are already connected by the existing orthogonal road
system (each east-west road connects all the m cities in that row and each north-south road connects
all the n cities in that column), thus no new highway is needed to connect them. Your task is to count
the number of highway that has to be built (a highway that goes through several cities on a straight
line is counted as a single highway).
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two
integers 1  n, m  300, specifying the number of cities. The input is terminated by a test case with
n = m = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing a single integer, the number of highways that must be
built.

```

## Sample Output

2 4

3 3
