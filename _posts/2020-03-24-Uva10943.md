title: Uva 10943  How do you add
---


## Input

```
Larry is very bad at math  he usually uses a calculator, which worked
well throughout college. Unforunately, he is now struck in a deserted
island with his good buddy Ryan after a snowboarding accident.

Theyre now trying to spend some time figuring out some good
problems, and Ryan will eat Larry if he cannot answer, so his fate is
up to you!

Its a very simple problem  given a number N , how many ways
can K numbers less than N add up to N?

For example, for N = 20 and K = 2, there are 21 ways:
0+20
1+19
2+18
3+17
4+16
5+15
...
18+2
19+1
20+0
```

## Output

```
Each line will contain a pair of numbers N and K. N and K will both be an integer from 1 to 100,
inclusive. The input will terminate on 2 0s.

```

## Sample Input

```
Since Larry is only interested in the last few digits of the answer, for each pair of numbers N and K,
print a single number mod 1,000,000 on a single line.

```

## Sample Output

```
20 2
20 2
0 0

```
