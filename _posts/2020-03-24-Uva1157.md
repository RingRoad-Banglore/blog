A time schedule is represented by a 0-1 matrix with n lines and m columns. Each line represents
a person and each column an event. All the persons participating to an event have a one in the
corresponding entry of their line. Persons not attending the event have a zero entry in that column.
Events occur consecutively.

Write a program that finds a smart permutation of the events where each person attends all its
events in a row. In other words, permute the columns of the matrix so that all ones are consecutive in
each line.
```

## Output

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first line of the input consists in the number n  400 of lines. The second line contains m  400,
the number of columns. Then comes the n lines of the matrix. Each line consists in m characters 0
or 1.

The input matrix is chosen so that there exists only one smart permutation which preserves column
0 in position 0. To make things easier, any two columns share few common one entries.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

The output consists of m numbers indicating the smart permutation of the columns. The first
number must be 0 as column 0 does not move. The second number indicate the index (in the input
matrix) of the second column, and so on.
