Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft,
"Hot Shots! Part Deux."

You are a political prisoner in jail. Things are looking grim, but fortunately, your jailmate has come
up with an escape plan. He has found a way for both of you to get out of the cell and run through the
city to the train station, where you will leave the country. Your friend will escape first and run along
the streets of the city to the train station. He will then call you from there on your cellphone (which
somebody smuggled in to you inside a cake), and you will start to run to the same train station. When
you meet your friend there, you will both board a train and be on your way to freedom.

Your friend will be running along the streets during the day, wearing his jail clothes, so people will
notice. This is why you can not follow any of the same streets that your friend follows - the authorities
may be waiting for you there. You have to pick a completely different path (although you may run
across the same intersections as your friend).

What is the earliest time at which you and your friend can board a train?

Problem, in short
Given a weighed, undirected graph, find the shortest path from S to T and back without using the

same edge twice.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain several test cases. Each test case will begin with an integer n (2  n  100)
 the number of nodes (intersections). The jail is at node number 1, and the train station is at node
number n. The next line will contain an integer m  the number of streets. The next m lines will
describe the m streets. Each line will contain 3 integers  the two nodes connected by the street and
the time it takes to run the length of the street (in seconds). No street will be longer than 1000 or
shorter than 1. Each street will connect two different nodes. No pair of nodes will be directly connected
by more than one street. The last test case will be followed by a line containing zero.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a single integer on a line by itself  the number of seconds you and your
friend need between the time he leaves the jail cell and the time both of you board the train. (Assume
that you do not need to wait for the train  they leave every second.) If there is no solution, print
Back to jail.
