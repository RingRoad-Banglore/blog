## Input

```

Solving problem is tough? Solving problem is
easy? Rather confusing. But no doubt, prob-
lem solving is fun. Again, theres no doubt that
problem setting is hard. Let alone the art of
finding new ideas & all those statement, solu-
tion, data stuffs. The toughest part is to live
with the fact that, if ever theres the slightest of
errors, you are doomed. Hence, setting quality
problems requires time. But once upon a time
in a far far away country, contest organizers
forgot this fact completely. So they went on or-
ganizing one after another prestigious contests
with very short notice to the problem setters.
However, the contests had grand success & ev-
eryone forgot about what happened to the poor
problem setters thereafter. Hence, the problem setters united & decided to have a useful plan for the
future.

The problem setters decided that everyone of them will create problems throughout the year &
maintain his own problem bank. Whenever someone creates a new problem, he adds the problem to
his problem bank & the problem setting director gives it a rating. Rating is an integer between 1 and
100007. Whenever a problem setter is requested to arrange a contest, best K problems (K problems
with maximum rating) are picked from his bank. The problems are used & removed from the bank.
There can be at most 100 problems in a contest.

Once a year, before the tide of contest season begins, the problem setting director collects all the
problems from the available banks & merges into a central problem bank. Any subsequent request for
problem is served from the central problem bank.

You are to write a program that manages the problem bank.

## Output

```
Input file start with an integer C (1  C  15), The number of test cases. Every test case starts
with an integer P (1  P  50) indicating the number of problems setters for that test case. Every
problem setter has his own problem bank. The bank of problem setter X is denoted by the integer X
(1  X  P ). At the beginning of a test case, all problem banks are empty. Another important thing
to notice is that, at a time there will be at most 5000000 problems in the merged problem bank & at
most 100000 problems in any other bank. Rest of the lines describe the operations on a problem bank
using some instructions. There can be 4 kinds of instructions as described below:

 An I instruction stands for an insert operation.
The format of a single character I followed by 4 integers B (1  B  P ), N (0  N  100000),
A0 (0  A0  1000000) & X (0  X  10000000), means insert N problems in the problem bank
with id B. The ratings of these N problems can be calculated using A0 & X. The rating of a
particular problem An = (An1 + n X)%100007 where n = 1 to N .

 An U instruction stands for a use & remove operation.

The U instruction consists of a single U character followed by two integers B (1  B  P ) &
K (0  K  number of problems in bankB) meaning that pick & remove the best K problems
from problem bank B.

 A M instruction means a merge operation.
Therell be at most one merge operation in a test case. A M instruction merges all the existing
problem banks in a single problem bank. This merged bank is denoted as bank #1 thereafter.

 A Q instruction indicates the end of a test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For every U instruction you receive, print 2 integers in a line showing the highest & lowest rating of
the problems selected with that particular instruction. If you dont pick any problem print a couple of
0. Print a blank line between test cases.

Explanation of Sample Input:
As we see, here are 3 problem setters in this case. Well call their problem banks 1, 2 & 3. The

first I instruction adds 3 problems to bank 1. The ratings of these 3 problems are, 1 (0 + 1 * 1), 3 (1
+ 2 * 1) & 6 (3 + 3 * 1). The second I instruction adds 5 problems to bank 2 with ratings 3 (0 + 1
* 3), 9 (3 + 2 * 3), 18 (9 + 3 * 3), 30 (18 + 4 * 3) & 45 (30 + 5 * 3). The third I instruction adds 4
problems to bank 3 with ratings 5 (2 + 1 * 3), 11 (5 + 2 * 3), 20 (11 + 3 * 3) & 32 (20 + 4 * 3). The
next I instruction adds 2 more problems to bank 1. The ratings are 8 (5 + 1 * 3) & 14 (8 + 2 * 3).
That means, bank 1 now has 5 problems. Then comes an U instruction. The first U instruction picks
the 4 most rated problems from bank 1 i.e. the problems with rating 14, 8, 6 & 3. You should print 14
& 3. The next U instruction selects 2 best problems from bank 2. They are the problems with rating
45 & 30. The merge operation merges the remaining problems (1, 3 & 4 problems from bank 1, 2 &
3 respectively) into a single bank & names it bank 1. The following U instruction is served from this
merged bank & the problems with rating 32, 20 & 18 are selected. The final I instruction asks to add
0 new problems to the merged problem bank.
