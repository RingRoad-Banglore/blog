---


## Input

```
Professor Octastichs has invented a new program-
ming language, Smeech. An expression in Smeech
may be a positive or negative integer, or may be of
the form (p e1 e2) where p is a real number between
0 and 1 (inclusive) and e1 and e2 are Smeech expres-
sions.

The value represented by a Smeech expression is
as follows:

 An integer represents itself

 With probability p, (p e1 e2) represents x + y
where x is the value of e1 and y is the value of
e2; otherwise it represents x y.

Given a Smeech expression, what is its expected
value?
