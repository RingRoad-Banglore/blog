## Input

```text
Eric has a classic football that is made of 32 pieces of leather: 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons.
Each pentagon adjoins 5 hexagons and each hexagon adjoins 3 pentagons and 3 hexagons. Eric drew
a polygon (i.e. a closed line without intersections) along the edges of the pieces. The polygon divided
the ball into two parts and Eric painted one of them green.

He is curious if given the description of the polygon you are able to compute the number of black,
white and green pieces?

Write a program that:

 reads the description of the polygon from the standard input,

 computes the number of black, white and green pieces,

 writes the result to the standard output.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases, each of them following the description below. A blank line separates
two consecutive cases.

The first line of the input contains one integer n being the number of vertices of the polygon. The
second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, . . . , an separated by single spaces. Integer ai (equal
1 or 2) is the number of green pieces adjoining the i-th vertex of the polygon. The side of the polygon
connecting the n-th and the first vertex always lies between two hexagons.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the first and only line of the output contains three integers b, w and g. These are
the numbers of black, white and green pieces respectively.

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
