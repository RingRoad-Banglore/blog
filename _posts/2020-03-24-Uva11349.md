title: Uva 11349  Symmetric Matrix
---


## Input

```
Youre given a square matrix M . Elements of this matrix are Mij : {0 < i < n, 0 < j < n}. In this
problem youll have to find out whether the given matrix is symmetric or not.

Definition: Symmetric matrix is such a matrix that all elements of it are non-negative and symmetric
with relation to the center of this matrix. Any other matrix is considered to be non-symmetric. For
example:

M =


 5 1 32 0 2

3 1 5


 is symmetric

M =


 5 1 32 0 2

0 1 5


 is not symmetric, because 3 = 0

All you have to do is to find whether the matrix is symmetric or not. Elements of a matrix given
in the input are 232  Mij  232 and 0 < n  100.
```

## Output

```
First line of input contains number of test cases T  300. Then T test cases follow each described in
the following way. The first line of each test case contains n  the dimension of square matrix. Then
n lines follow each of then containing row i. Row contains exactly n elements separated by a space
character. j-th number in row i is the element Mij of matrix you have to process.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output one line Test #t: S. Where t is the test number starting from 1. Line S is
equal to Symmetric if matrix is symmetric and Non-symmetric in any other case.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
N = 3
5 1 3
2 0 2
3 1 5
N = 3
5 1 3
2 0 2
0 1 5
