```
A complex system that works is invariably found

to have evolved from a simple system that works.

John Gaule

Everyone knows about base-2 (binary) integers and base-10 (decimal) integers, but what about base
i  1? A complex integer n has the form n = a + bi, where a and b are integers, and i is the square
root of 1 (which means that i2 = 1). A complex integer n written in base (i  1) is a sequence of
digits (bi), writen right-to-left, each of which is either 0 or 1 (no negative or imaginary digits!), and the
following equality must hold.

n = b0 + b1(i  1) + b2(i  1)2 + b3(i  1)3 + . . .

The cool thing is that every complex integer has a unique base-(i-1) representation, with no minus
sign required. Your task is to find this representation.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (at most 20000). N test cases follow. Each one is a
line containing a complex integer a+ bi as a pair of integers, a and b. Both a and b will be in the range
from -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by the same complex integer, written
in base i  1 with no leading zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
1 0
2 3
11 0
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case #1: 1
Case #2: 1011
Case #3: 111001101
Case #4: 0
```
