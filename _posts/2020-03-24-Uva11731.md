title: Uva 11731  Ex-circles
---


## Input

```text
In the figure on the right you can see triangle
ABC and its in-circle (Circle that touches all
the sides of a triangle internally) and three ex-
circles (Circles that touch one side internally
and other two sides externally). D, E and F
are centers of the ex-circles.

Given the length of the sides of triangle
ABC, you will have to find the area of trian-
gle DEF and also the total area of the three
grey shaded regions.
```

## Output

```text
The input file can contain up to 6000 lines of
inputs. Each line contains three positive integer
numbers a, b, c which denotes the length of
the sides of the triangle ABC. You can assume
that these three sides can form a valid triangle
(positive area) and none of the side length is
greater than 1000.

Input is terminated by a line containing
three zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by
two floating-point numbers. The first one denotes the area of triangle DEF and second one denotes the
total area of the three gray shaded regions. This floating-point numbers should have two digits after
the decimal point. You can assume that small precision errors will not cause difference in the printed
output.
