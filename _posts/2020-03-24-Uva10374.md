```
Canada has a multi-party system of government. Each candidate is generally associated with a party,
and the party whose candidates win the most ridings generally forms the government. Some candidates
run as independents, meaning they are not associated with any party. Your job is to count the votes
for a particular riding and to determine the party with which the winning candidate is associated.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first line of input contains a positive integer n satisfying 2  n  20, the number of candidates
in the riding. n pairs of lines follow: the first line in each pair is the name of the candidate, up to 80
characters; the second line is the name of the party, up to 80 characters, or the word independent
if the candidate has no party. No candidate name is repeated and no party name is repeated in the
input. No lines contain leading or trailing blanks.

The next line contains a positive integer m  10000, and is followed by m lines each indicating
the name of a candidate for which a ballot is cast. Any names not in the list of candidates should be
ignored.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

candidate and that candidate is associated with a party.
