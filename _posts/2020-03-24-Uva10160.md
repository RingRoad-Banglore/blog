Write a program for finding out the minumum number of stations, which the company has to build,
so that the above condition holds.

## Output

```text
The input consists of more than one description of town (but totally, less than ten descriptions). Every
description starts with number N of towns and number M of pairs of towns directly connected each
other. The integers N and M are separated by a space. Every one of the next M rows contains a pair
of connected towns, one pair per row. The pair consists of two integers for towns numbers, separated
by a space. The input ends with N = 0 and M = 0.

```
