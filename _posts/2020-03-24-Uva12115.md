title: Uva 12115  Nested Squares
---


## Input

```
Simple ASCII characters can form a figure containing nested squares: as shown in Figure-1 below. Here
the outer most square is formed by character a, the next square is formed by character b and the
innermost square is formed by character c.

Figure 1: Nested squares
of ASCII characters

Figure 2: This is a nested square generated by the characteristic string
abca. The dotted rectangle is the bounding box denoted by the corners

(3,2) and (5,7).

Such a square can be denoted uniquely by a characteristics string abc: that is the first character
forms the outermost square, the next character forms the next square and so on. So a string of length
50000 can actually denote a (99999  99999) square grid, which will require around 9 Gigabyte of
memory to be stored normally. In this problem you will be asked to print a small portion of such a
huge square.

The different characters that form a (N N) square are numbered in row major order, the upper
left character is at position (1, 1) and the lower right character is at position (N,N). This is shown in
Figure 2.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains an integer N (0 < N < 31) which denotes how many sets of inputs are there.
The description of each set is given below.

The first line of each set contains a string S (1  |S|  50000) and an integer Q (1  Q  50). Here
S is the characteristic string of a nested square pattern and |S| is the length of string S. This string
contains only alphabets and decimal digits. The integer Q denotes the total number of query. Each of
the next Q lines contain four integers r1, c1, r2, c2, which actually denotes a bounding box whose upper
left corner is (r1, c1) and lower right corner is (r2, c2). You can assume that (1  r1, c1, r2, c2  2|S|1),
0  r2  r1  100 and 0  c2  c1  100.

There is a blank line between two consecutive input cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input produce several lines of output.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12115  Nested Squares 2/2

The first line of output for each set contains the serial of the set. Then for each query produce the
serial of query followed by the contents within the required bounding box.

Print a blank line after the output for each test case.
Look at the output for sample input for details.
