```
The FCC (Foundation for Combating Corruption) dismantled a major corruption scheme in Nlogonia.
During the operation, several account books, with notes documenting the illicit transactions carried
out by the scheme, were seized by FCC agents.

Each page on the account books contains some transactions (income or expense, in nilogos, the
local currency of Nlognia, whose symbol is N$) and the cash flow resulting from transaco tions on that
page. For example, if a page recorded the following transactions: an income of N$ 7, an income of N$
2, an expense of N$ 3, an income of N$ 1 and an expense of N$ 11, the cash flow on that page would
be 7 + 2 - 3 + 1 - 11 = -4.

However, to obstruct the work of the police, the offenders did not record in their account books the
type of each transaction (income or expense). In the example above, the page would contain only the
numbers 7, 2, 3, 1 and 11 (with no indication whether they were income or expense transactions). The
cash flow for each page, however, was always recorded normally, with the signal (in this case, -4).

To guarantee that the offenders are convicted, prosecutors must be able to determine with certainty
whether each transaction is an income or an expense. In the example above, transaction N$ 7 was
certainly an income, and transaction N$ 11 was certainly an expense. But we cannot say anything
about transactions N$ 2, N$ 3, and N$ 1. Transactions N$ 2 and N$ 1 could have been income and in
this case transaction N$ 3 would have been an expense; or N$ 1 and N$ 2 could have been expenses
and in this case transaction N$ 3 would be an income.

Many account books have a relatively large number of pages, with many transactions, making it is
difficult for the police to process all the information. Therefore, they need a program that performs the
task efficiently.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two integers N and
F , indicating the number of transactions on the page (2  N  40) and cash flow for this page
(16000  F  16000). Each of the following N lines contains an integer Ti indicating the value of the
i-th transaction (1  Ti  1000).

The last test case is followed by a line containing only two numbers zero separated by a space.

```

## Output

```
For each test case the input your program must print a single line with N characters. The i-th character
must be +, if it is possible determine with certainty that the i-th transaction is an income, -, if it is
possible to determine with certainty that the i-th operation is an expense, and ?, if it is impossible
to determine with certainty the type of transaction. If the cash flow recorded in the page cannot be
obtained from the transactions recorded in the page, your program must print a single line containing
the character *.
