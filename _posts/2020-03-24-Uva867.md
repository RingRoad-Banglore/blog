title: Uva 00867  Storing Images in a Sequence
---


```
A web server for a site must store a set of large images in a sequential device, like a magnetic tape
cassette. The images appear in the pages of the site, one per page. There are links between the pages
where the images belong, so we know which image(s) might be required after some image is serveFor
each image, we consider as direct neighbours the images which are one link away. If we have four
images and image 1 is linked to image 4, and image 2 is linked to images 3 and 4, we may represent
this graphically as follows:

Figure 2.1 - Links between images

If the images are stored in a sequential device, they must be ordered, and the distance between
those that are directly linked depends on the ordering. Two possible orderings for the example above
are:

Given a set of (bi-directional) image dependencies, find an ordering that minimises the maximum
distance for two linked images. There are at most 25 images
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first input line contains the number N of images. Each of the subsequent N lines, one for each
image, contains the number of the image and the numbers of its neighbour images, separated by single
spaces.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

Two lines, the first with the maximum distance between linked images and the second with an
ordering of the images.
