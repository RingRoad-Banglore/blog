title: Uva 13228  Laser Avoidance
---


## Input

```
You start at point (0, 0) and must reach point (p, q) on a flat field. Unfortunately there is a number of
lasers you have to avoid. Each laser starts at a point (x, y) and shoots out an infinite one directional
ray at radian angle  from the x-axis. Given the position of the lasers, find the shortest path you can
take without getting hit by a laser.
```

## Output

```
A number of test cases (< 100).

For each test case, the first row is the three integer n, the total number of lasers, and the end point
(p, q). The next n line, each has two integers x, y and a real number , describing the laser as defined
above as position of laser and the angle with respect to the x-axis.

Note that 0  n, p, |q|, |x|, |y|  1000000,   [, ).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the answer with 5 digits after decimal, on one line.

```

## Sample Output

```
3 5 5
2 1 1
3 1 2
4 1 -1.5
3 5 0
5 2 1
5 2 2
5 2 -1.5
