title: Uva 10881  Piotrs Ants
---


## Input

```text
One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them;

the ants will soon be here. And I, for one, welcome our
new insect overlords.

Kent Brockman

Piotr likes playing with ants. He has n of them on a horizontal pole L cm long. Each ant is facing
either left or right and walks at a constant speed of 1 cm/s. When two ants bump into each other, they
both turn around (instantaneously) and start walking in opposite directions. Piotr knows where each
of the ants starts and which direction it is facing and wants to calculate where the ants will end up T
seconds from now.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a line
containing 3 integers: L , T and n (0  n  10000). The next n lines give the locations of the n ants
(measured in cm from the left end of the pole) and the direction they are facing (L or R).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: followed by n lines describing the locations
and directions of the n ants in the same format and order as in the input. If two or more ants are at
the same location, print Turning instead of L or R for their direction. If an ant falls off the pole
before T seconds, print Fell off for that ant. Print an empty line after each test case.

```
