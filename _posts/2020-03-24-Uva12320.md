## Input

```text
Air traffic controllers are the people who expedite and maintain a safe and orderly flow of air traffic
in the global air traffic control system. The position of the air traffic controller is one that requires
highly specialized skills. Because controllers have an incredibly large responsibility while on duty,
this profession is, according to Wikipedia, regarded around the world as one of the most difficult
jobs today, and can be notoriously stressful depending on many variables (equipment, configurations,
weather, traffic volume, human factors, etc.).

An air traffic controller has access to the following information for each aircraft on the screen:

 size: a positive integer number r indicating the radius (measured in meters) of a security sphere
whose center always is the current position of the aircraft;

 speed: a positive integer number s indicating the constant speed (measured in meters per second)
of the aircraft along its route;

 route: a sequence of points (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), . . . , (xk, yk, zk) with integer coordinates (mea-
sured in meters) in the three-dimensional Cartesian plane, indicating the path followed by the
aircraft before it returns to the head of the track which is located at the point (0, 0, 0).

Each aircraft begins its journey at the position (x1, y1, z1) and then, it directly flies in a straight line
at constant speed from (x1, y1, z1) to (x2, y2, z2), ..., from (xk1, yk1, zk1) to (xk, yk, zk), and finally
from (xk, yk, zk) to (0, 0, 0), where each position is relative to the head of the track. After the aircraft
arrives at the head of the track, it disappears from the controllers screen.

On a day-to-day basis, air traffic controllers deal with conflict detection and resolution. Therefore,
for an air traffic controller is very important to have an alarm system to indicate the specific points
where it must take corrective actions to prevent accidents.

It is noteworthy that, geometrically speaking, a conflict warning occurs when the security spheres
of two aircrafts touch. Formally, a conflict warning begins when two aircrafts approach at a distance
less than or equal to the sum of the radius of their security spheres, is maintained while this condition
is satisfied, and ends when their security spheres stop touching (i.e., when the distance between both is

greater than the sum of the radius of their security spheres). Distances are measured with an acceptable
error threshold  > 0.

Despite years of effort and the billions of dollars that have been spent on computer software designed
to assist air traffic control, success has been largely limited to improving the tools at the disposal of the
controllers. However, today you have the chance to improve the impact of computer software in the air
traffic control world.

You have been hired by the International Center of Planning Control (ICPC) to determine the
quality of the traffic routes defined by the Aircraft Controller Management (ACM), through the mea-
surement of the number of dangerous situations that should fix the air traffic controller. Your task
is to write a program that, given the information of two aircrafts, determines the number of different
conflict warnings that would arise if both aircrafts follow the scheduled route starting at the same time
and finishing at the tracks head.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases. Each test case specifies the information of
the two studied aircrafts, where each aircraft is described as follows:

 The first line contains three integer numbers r, s and k separated by blanks (1  r  100,
1  s  1000, 1  k  100), where r is the radius of the security sphere (in meters), s is the
speed (in meters per second), and k is the number of points that define the route of the aircraft.

 Each one of the next k lines contains three integer numbers xi, yi, and zi separated by blanks
(104  xi  104, 104  yi  104, 0  zi  104), describing the coordinates (in meters) of the
i-th point on the route of the aircraft (1  i  k).

For each route, you may assume that either xi = xi+1, yi = yi+1 or zi = zi+1 for all 1  i < k, and
that either xk = 0, yk = 0 or zk = 0. The acceptable error threshold is  = 1010 meters.
