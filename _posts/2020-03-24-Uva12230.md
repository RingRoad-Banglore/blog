title: Uva 12230  Crossing Rivers
---


## Input

```
You live in a village but work in another village. You decided to follow the straight path between your
house (A) and the working place (B), but there are several rivers you need to cross. Assume B is to
the right of A, and all the rivers lie between them.

Fortunately, there is one automatic boat moving smoothly in each river. When you arrive the
left bank of a river, just wait for the boat, then go with it. Youre so slim that carrying you does not
change the speed of any boat.

Days and days after, you came up with the following question: assume each boat is independently
placed at random at time 0, what is the expected time to reach B from A? Your walking speed is
always 1.

To be more precise, for a river of length L, the distance of the boat (which could be regarded as a
mathematical point) to the left bank at time 0 is uniformly chosen from interval [0, L], and the boat
is equally like to be moving left or right, if its not precisely at the river bank.
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 10 test cases. Each case begins with two integers n and D, where n (0  n  10)
is the number of rivers between A and B, D (1  D  1000) is the distance from A to B. Each of the
following n lines describes a river with 3 integers: p, L and v (0  p < D, 0 < L  D, 1  v  100). p
is the distance from A to the left bank of this river, L is the length of this river, v is the speed of the
boat on this river. It is guaranteed that rivers lie between A and B, and they dont overlap. The last
test case is followed by n = D = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the expected time, rounded to 3 digits after the decimal
point.

Print a blank line after the output of each test case.
