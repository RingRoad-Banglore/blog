title: Uva 12012  Detection of Extraterrestrial
---


## Input

```
E.T. Inc. employs Maryanna as alien signal researcher. To identify possible alien signals and background
noise, she develops a method to evaluate the signals she has already received. The signal sent by E.T
is more likely regularly alternative.

Received signals can be presented by a string of small latin letters a to z whose length is N . For
each X between 1 and N inclusive, she wants you to find out the maximum length of the substring
which can be written as a concatenation of X same strings. For clarification, a substring is a consecutive
part of the original string.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains T , the number of test cases (T  200). Most of the test cases are relatively
small. T lines follow, each contains a string of only small latin letters a - z, whose length N is less
than 1000, without any leading or trailing whitespaces.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single line, which should begin with the case number counting from 1,
followed by N integers. The X-th (1-based) of them should be the maximum length of the substring
which can be written as a concatenation of X same strings. If that substring doesnt exist, output 0
instead. See the sample for more format details.

Hint: For the second sample, the longest substring which can be written as a concatenation of 2 same
strings is noonnoon, oonnoonn, onnoonno, nnoonnoo, any of those has length 8; the longest
substring which can be written as a concatenation of 3 same strings is the string itself. As a result, the
second integer in the answer is 8 and the third integer in the answer is 12.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
arisetocrat
noonnoonnoon

```
