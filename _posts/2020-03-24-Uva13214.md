---


## Input

```
A robot travels over a luminous grid. Initially the grid is off and every time the robot walks over a cell,
this cell turns on a light that keeps lighted while the robot keeps moving.

The robot can only make to actions:

 Take a step forward

 Turn 90 degrees clockwise and advance one step forward.

The robot always starts from the lower left corner facing the top of the grid. It can do any sequence
of movements a and b (it can make many consecutive a movements, or many consecutive b movements,
or alternate them in any way) as long as it does not leaves the grid and dont pass over a previously
lighted cell (ie, it can only pass once over every cell). Whenever its possible, the robot will keep moving,
stopping only when he reaches a cell where he cant make more movements, ending the route. How
many different routes can the robot make over the grid?

Example for a grid of 2 rows and 3 columns, where 3 different routes can be done
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T , the number of test cases. Each case contains two
integers R and C, the number of rows and columns of the grid (2  R  25, 1  C  25).

```

## Sample Input

For each case print a line with the number of different routes that the robot can make.
