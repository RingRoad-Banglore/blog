title: Uva 11499  Longest Increasing Sub-sequence
---


## Input

```text

The problem of determining the longest increasing sub-sequence in a list of numbers is already a classic
in programming competitions. Despite this fact, that is the problem you must solve here. But, in
order to avoid having you yawning while solving the problem, we introduced a small change: the list of
numbers will be given as a bidimensional matrix, and the increasing sequence must be embedded in
a submatrix of the original matrix.

Lets define the problem more precisely. The linearization of a bidimensional matrix is the concate-
nation of its lines, from the first to the last. A submatrix is a rectangular region of a bidimensional
matrix (with sides paralel to the sides of the matrix). The size of a submatrix is its number of elements.
You must write a program that, given a matrix of integers, determines the largest submatrix such that,
when linearized, results in an increasing sequence.

The figure below shows some examples of submatrices of largest size which contain increasing se-
quences. Notice that more than one such a submatrix may exist in a given matrix.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two integers N and M
indicating the matrix dimensions (1  N,M  600). Each of the next N lines contains M integers,
separated by a space, describing the elements of the matrix. Element Xi,j of the matrix is the j-th
integer of the i-th line in the input (106  Xi,j  106).

The end of input is indicated by a line containing only two zeros, separated by a space.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input your program must print one single line, containing the size of the largest
sub-matrix that, when linearized, results in an increasing sequence.
