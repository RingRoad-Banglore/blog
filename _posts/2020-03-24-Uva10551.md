```
Given a base b and two non-negative base b integers
p and m, compute p mod m and print the result as
a base-b integer. p mod m is defined as the small-
est non-negative integer k such that p = a m+ k
for some integer a.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of a number of cases. Each case is rep-
resented by a line containing three unsigned integers.
The first, b, is a decimal number between 2 and 10.
The second, p, contains up to 1000 digits between 0 and b  1. The third, m, contains up to 9 digits
between 0 and b 1. The last case is followed by a line containing 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line giving p mod m as a base-b integer.
