title: Uva 11562  Hard Evidence
---


## Input

```text
The young reporter Janne is planning to take a photo of a secret government
installation. He needs to obtain evidence of the many serious crimes against
good sense that are being committed there, so as to create a scandal and
possibly win a Pulitzer. Unfortunately, the base is surrounded by a high
fence with high voltage wires running around. Janne does not want to risk
being electrocuted, so he wants to take a photo from outside the fence. He
can bring a tripod as high as the fence to take a photo, so if he wants he can
stand right beside the fence and take his picture. The secret installation is a
convex polygon. The fence has a form of a circle. Of course Janne wants to
make a photo with maximal possible detail level.

Consider taking a photo of the base from some point P outside the fence.
Let Q be the left-most point of the base when viewed from P , and let R be the right-most point of
the base when viewed from P . Then the view angle of the base at P is the angle at P in the triangle
formed by the three points P , Q and R.

The detail level of the photo depends on the view angle of the base at the point from which the
photo is taken. Therefore he wants to find a point to maximize this angle.

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of the input file contains two integer numbers: n and r  the number of vertices of
the polygon and the radius of the fence (3  n  200, 1  r  1000 ). The following n lines contain two
real numbers each  the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon listed in counterclockwise order. It
is guaranteed that all vertices of the polygon are strictly inside the fence circle, and that the polygon
is convex. The center of the fence circle is located at the origin, (0, 0).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, write to the output the maximal view angle a for the photo (0  a < 2), on a line
by itself. Any answer with either absolute or relative error smaller than 106 is acceptable.
