title: Uva 11229  Improved tictactoe

## Input

```
Tic Tac Toe grid Didi and Dede are two kids who
love to play the famous game of tic-tac-toe all the
time, but, right now, they have a problem: the final
exams from school are coming up. Being quite smart,
they came up with a way to play the game and study
at the same time! Before learning about Didi and
Dedes new (and improved) version of Tic Tac Toe,
lets remember the rules of the original game: theres
a 3 3 board thats initially empty and players take
turns selecting one empty space and filling it (one player fills it with an O and the other fills it with an
X). The first player to fill the main diagonal or the secondary diagonal or either a complete vertical
or horizontal line with 3 of his symbols wins the game. If there are no more positions to fill and none
of the players made a winning line, its a tie.

In their improved version, Didi and Dede assigned to each board place a study subject: the first
one got physics, the second one got math, the third one got Portuguese and so on. Then they came
up with a lot different exercises for each one of the subjects. The game then goes like this: like in the
classic version, the board begins empty; in the players turn he can pick any empty position and he will
be asked a random question about the subject associated with that position - if he answers it correctly,
hell put his symbol in the position, otherwise the opponents symbol will be placed there. The winning
condition is the same of the classic version.

Even tough they came up with this game to study, Didi and Dede hate to lose! They know that who
plays first has a better chance to win, so they always try to win when playing first and try not to loose
when playing second. They also know each other very well (after all those years playing tic-tac-toe
and studying together), so they know whats the probability that each one has to answer correctly one
question on any subject.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, T (1  T  50). T test cases follow. A test case starts
with a blank line. Then you will have two 3 3 grids for the first and second player, respectively. Each
grid has 9 integers from 0 to 100 (included), being given 3 integers per line. These numbers correspond
to the probability of the player gets a correct answer for the related position (study subject).

```

## Sample Input

```
The output is comprised of one line for each input data set. For each test case output Case #C:
(where C is the number of the current test case) followed by the probability of the first player wins,
rounded to 2 decimals, if both players had the capacity of playing optimizing their goals.
