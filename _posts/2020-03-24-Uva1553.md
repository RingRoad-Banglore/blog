title: Uva 01553  Buffer Manager

## Input

```text

DBMS (Data Base Management System) development team has been successful in designing efficient
Lock Manager and is going to proceed further. As a part of the team you will be responsible for the
Buffer Manager.

Data blocks being read by DBMS from the hard drive are stored in the main memory in a fixed
number of pre-allocated buffers. Each buffer can hold one data block. Each buffer can be either free
(does not contain any useful information) or occupied by some data. When DBMS is going to read
data block from the hard drive it has to decide which buffer to use for data storing. If there are any
free buffers, then one of them is used for that purpose. If there are no free buffers, then one of the
occupied buffers has to be flushed to become free, unless it was locked by some part of DBMS.

The choice of the buffer to flush is critical to DBMS performance. A lot of different algorithms were
developed, LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm being the one used most often. However, your DBMS
is going to implement the Advanced Buffer Management algorithm which takes advantage of the fact
that maximal performance is achieved when a number of consecutive data blocks from the hard drive
are read into consecutive memory buffers.

Buffers are numbered from 1 to N , where N (1  N  100000) is a total number of buffers. Each
buffer can be in any one of the following states: free, occupied or locked. Each occupied buffer is
assigned an integer number from 1 to 9 - the worthiness of the currently stored information in that
buffer. The worthiness of free buffers is considered to be zero. Locked buffers cannot be neither used
nor flushed and their worthiness is undefined.

Having received the request to read K (1  K  10000) data blocks from the hard drive, Buffer
Manager has to choose K consecutive non-locked buffers numbered from L to L + K  1 that have
minimal possible sum of their worthiness, or to report that it is impossible to find K consecutive
non-locked buffers. The latter can also happen if total number of buffers is less than K.

Your task is to write a program that models the processing of one request to Buffer Manager using
the above algorithm.

## Output

```text
Input consists of several datasets. The first line of each dataset contains two integers, N and K,
separated by a space.

Starting from the second line there is a description of a buffers state. The state of each buffer is
represented by a single character:

 0  when the corresponding buffer is free.

 1  when the corresponding buffer is occupied and has worthiness of 1.

 2  when the corresponding buffer is occupied and has worthiness of 2.

 ...

 9  when the corresponding buffer is occupied and has worthiness of 9.

 *  when the corresponding buffer is locked.

Those characters are situated on the consecutive lines grouped by 80 characters per line without
any spaces. Thus, each line starting from the second one contains exactly 80 characters with a possible
exception for the last line.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, write to the output the single integer number L in a single line. This number gives
the buffer number where first of the K blocks from the hard drive shall be read to ensure the minimal
possible total worthiness of the blocks that have to be flushed. If there are more than one such value
for L, then write the smallest one.

Write to the output file a single number 0 if its impossible to find K consecutive non-locked
buffers.
