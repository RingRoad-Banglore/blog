title: Uva 10545  Maximal Quadrilateral
---


## Input

```
A circle is inscribed in a quadrilateral and the circle touches
all four sides of it. Given the perimeter and the length of two
adjacent sides of the quadrilateral, you will have to find the
maximum possible radius of the circle. You can assume that
 = 2  cos1(0.0).
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N  100)
that indicates how many sets of input are there. Each of the next
N lines contains three integers P , A, B. Here P is the perimeter
and A, B are the length of two adjacent sides of the quadrilateral.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input except the first one, produce one line of output. This line should contain the
serial of the output and then the maximum possible radius of the circle. The radius should have six
digits after the decimal point. If the formation of such a quadrilateral is impossible then print the line
Eta Shombhob Na. (Sorry! It is a sentence in Bangla, which means This is impossible.). Errors less
than 0.00001 will be ignored. The lengths of all sides of a valid quadrilateral should be positive. Look
at the output for sample input for details:

## Sample Output

20 5 6
20 10 12
