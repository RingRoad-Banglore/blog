title: Uva 12166  Equilibrium Mobile
---


```
A mobile is a type of kinetic sculpture constructed to take
advantage of the principle of equilibrium. It consists of
a number of rods, from which weighted objects or further
rods hang. The objects hanging from the rods balance each
other, so that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each
rod hangs from only one string, which gives it freedom to
rotate about the string.

We consider mobiles where each rod is attached to its
string exactly in the middle, as in the figure underneath.
You are given such a configuration, but the weights on the
ends are chosen incorrectly, so that the mobile is not in
equilibrium. Since thats not aesthetically pleasing, you
decide to change some of the weights.

What is the minimum number of weights that you must
change in order to bring the mobile to equilibrium? You
may substitute any weight by any (possibly non-integer)
weight. For the mobile shown in the figure, equilibrium can be reached by changing the middle weight
from 7 to 3, so only 1 weight needs to changed.

## Input

```
On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most
100. After that per testcase:

 One line with the structure of the mobile, which is a recursively
defined expression of the form:

< expr > ::= < weight > | "[" < expr > "," < expr > "]"

with < weight > a positive integer smaller than 109 indicating a
weight and [< expr >,< expr >] indicating a rod with the two expressions at the ends of the
rod. The total number of rods in the chain from a weight to the top of the mobile will be at most
16.

```

## Output

```
Per testcase:

 One line with the minimum number of weights that have to be changed.
