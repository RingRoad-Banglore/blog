title: Uva 01176  A Benevolent Josephus
---


```
You must have heard of the Josephus problem in connection with link lists. It dealt with finding the
only survivor among n persons. Here you have a game with a rather happy outcome. Suppose n players
stand in a circle. Counting from player number 1 every alternate player is temporarily removed (for
example, at first 2 is removed) to finally end up with the single survivor. After the survivor has been
determined each player with number higher than the survivor is paid Tk. 1 and permanently removed
from the circle. The same operation is repeated with the remaining players, and players with number
higher than the survivor are paid Tk. 1 each and removed from the circle again. Once such an operation
fails to decrease the number of players in the circle, each of them is paid Tk. 2 and the game ends.
Your problem is to determine total amount of money Josephus will have to pay to all players.

For example, with 5 players in the first
round survivor is 3, so players number 4 and
5 are paid Taka 1 each and removed from the
game. In the next round survivor is player num-
ber 3 again. Consequently no one could be re-
moved, therefore each of them is paid Taka 2,
so in total (2 + 2 3 =) 8 will be paid for this
game.
