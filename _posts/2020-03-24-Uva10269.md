## Input

```text
After rescuing the beautiful princess, Super Mario needs to find a way home  with the princess of
course :-) Hes very familiar with the Super Mario World, so he doesnt need a map, he only needs
the best route in order to save time.

There are A Villages and B Castles in the world. Villages are numbered 1 . . . A, and Castles are
numbered A+ 1 . . . A+ B. Mario lives in Village 1, and the castle he starts from is numbered A+ B.
Also, there are twoway roads connecting them. Two places are connected by at most one road and a
place never has a road connecting to itself. Mario has already measured the length of every road, but
they dont want to walk all the time, since he walks one unit time for one unit distance (how slow!).

Luckily, in the Castle where he saved the princess, Mario found a magic boot. If he wears it, he can
super-run from one place to another IN NO TIME. (Dont worry about the princess, Mario has found
a way to take her with him when superrunning, but he wouldnt tell you :--P)

Since there are traps in the Castles, Mario NEVER superruns through a Castle. He always stops
when there is a castle on the way. Also, he starts/stops superrunnings ONLY at Villages or Castles.

Unfortunately, the magic boot is too old, so he cannot use it to cover more than L kilometers at
a time, and he cannot use more than K times in total. When he comes back home, he can have it
repaired and make it usable again.

## Output

```text
The first line in the input contains a single integer T , indicating the number of test cases (1  T  20).
Each test case begins with five integers A, B, M , L and K  the number of Villages, the number of
Castles (1  A,B  50), the number of roads, the maximal distance that can be covered at a time
(1  L  500), and the number of times the boot can be used (0  K  10). The next M lines each
contains three integers Xi, Yi, Li. That means there is a road connecting place Xi and Yi. The distance
is Li, so the walk time is also Li (1  Li  100).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case in the input print a line containing a single integer indicating the minimal time
needed to go home with the beautiful princess. Its guaranteed that Super Mario can always go home.
