10439 Temple of Dune
The Archaeologists of the Current Mille-
nium (ACM) now and then discover an-
cient artifacts located at the vertices of
regular polygons. In general it is neces-
sary to move one sand dune to uncover
each artifact. After discovering three ar-
tifacts, the archaeologists wish to com-
pute the minimum number of dunes that
must be moved to uncover all of them.

## Input
The first line of input contains a positive
integer n, the number of test cases. Each
test case consists of three pairs of real
numbers giving the x and y coordinates
of three vertices from a regular polygon.

## Output
For each line of input, output a single integer stating the fewest vertices that such a polygon might
have.

You may assume that each input case gives three distinct vertices of a regular polygon with at most
200 vertices.
