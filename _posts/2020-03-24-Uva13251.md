title: Uva 13251  Compact Terms

## Input

```
A term is a tree-like structure used in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy to identify entities
in a domain of discourse. What is remarkable about terms is that they offer a direct encoding of such
entities that a computer can process.

For a particular domain of discourse, the set of terms is parametric on a set of variables V and a
set of function symbols F ; it is inductively defined by the following rules:

 Any variable is a term.

 Any function symbol f with ar(f) = 0 is a term.

 Any expression f(t1, . . . , tn), with ar(f) = n  1 and each argument ti a term (1  i  n), is a
term.

Here ar is a function from the set of function symbols F to the natural numbers. For each f  F ,
the expression ar(f) denotes the number of arguments of f .

For example, for F = {a, f, g, h} with ar(a) = 0, ar(g) =
ar(h) = 2, ar(f) = 3, and X a variable, let t be the term
f(g(h(a, a), h(a, a)), h(a,X), g(h(a, a), h(a, a))). The term t can
be graphically represented as a labeled tree with 18 vertices as
inn the picture on the right.

A string representation of a term, in general, can be unneces-
sarily lengthy and thus inefficient to compute with. An important
observation to cope with this limitation is that subterms can be
shared and then a tree can be represented by a directed acyclic
multigraph (or dam). In a dam, vertices are labeled with function
symbols from F and variables from V, and edges are labeled with the argument position of the corre-
sponding subterm in the term structure. Note that there can be more than one edge between any pair
of vertices of a dam.

The following dams are representations of the term t abovementioned. In these representations, for
example, the topmost function symbol f is applied over three terms of which the first and third are
shared: this is indicated by labels 1 and 3 in the edges with source f .

Although these dams represent the same term, they differ in the number of vertices: the one on the
left has 7 vertices and the one on the right has 6 vertices. There can be many other dams representing
the term t, but any of them requires at least 6 vertices.

In this problem, the interest is in computing the size (with respect to the number of vertices) of
a dam representing a term which shares the most number of subterms. More precisely, the goal is to
compute the minimum number of vertices required to represent a term as a dam.

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases, each being a line containing a string representation of a term
s (1  |s|  105). A variable in V is represented in s by a string v (1  |v|  20) made of lowercase
and uppercase letters of the English alphabet starting with an uppercase letter. Similarly, a function
symbol in F is represented in s by a string f (1  |f |  20) made of lowercase and uppercase letters
of the English alphabet starting with a lowercase letter. You can assume that s contains at most 2 000
variables and function symbols (not necessarily different).
