title: Uva 11533  Special Number
---


## Input

```

A puzzle from the 1962 International Mathematics Olympiad: We have a number (integer) with 6 as
the last (right-most) digit (936 for example). If we erase the 6 and put it on the left end of the number
(693 in our example), then we have a number four times our original number. We see that 936 doesnt
work. What is the smallest number that does fit the above conditions?

For this problem, we slightly generalize this puzzle:

We have an N -base number (integer) with X as the last (right-most) digit. If we erase the X
and put it on the left end of the number, then we have another N -base number which is Y times our
original number. Given N (in [2,256]), X and Y , what is the smallest number that does fit the above
conditions?
```

## Output

```
There will be no more than 1000 cases. Each test case will consist of exactly three integers in a line,
giving the values of N , X and Y respectively.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number, followed by the digits in the target number, each digit separated
by a single space. If there is no solution, print a message No solution for that case.

```

## Sample Output

```
10 6 4

10 3 1

123 31 3

```
