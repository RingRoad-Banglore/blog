256 Quirksome Squares
The number 3025 has a remarkable quirk: if you split its decimal representation in two strings of equal
length (30 and 25) and square the sum of the numbers so obtained, you obtain the original number:

(30 + 25)2 = 3025

The problem is to determine all numbers with this property having a given even number of digits.

For example, 4-digit numbers run from 0000 to 9999. Note that leading zeroes should be taken
into account. This means that 0001 which is equal to (00 + 01)2 is a quirksome number of 4 digits.
The number of digits may be 2,4,6 or 8. Although maxint is only 32767 and numbers of eight digits
are asked for, a well-versed programmer can keep his numbers in the range of the integers. However
efficiency should be given a thought.

## Input
The input of your program is a textflle containing numbers of digits (taken from 2,4,6,8), each number
on a line of its own.

## Output
The output is a textfile consisting of lines containing the quirksome numbers (ordered according to the
input numbers and for each input number in increasing order).

Warning: Please note that the number of digits in the output is equal to the number in the corre-
sponding input line : leading zeroes may not be suppressed.

## Sample Input
<p>2</p><p>2</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>00</p><p>01</p><p>81</p><p>00</p><p>01</p><p>81</p>
