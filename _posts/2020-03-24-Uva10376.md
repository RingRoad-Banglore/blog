title: Uva 10376  Snakes
---


```
Buffalo Bill wishes to cross a 1000 1000 square field. A number of snakes are on the field at various
positions, and each snake can strike a particular distance in any direction. Can Bill make the trip
without being bitten?
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

Assume that the southwest corner of the field is at (0,0) and the northwest corner at (0,1000). The
input consists of a line containing n  1000, the number of snakes. A line follows for each snake,
containing three real numbers: the (x,y) location of the snake and its strike distance. The snake will
bite anything that passes closer than this distance from its location.

Bill must enter the field somewhere between the southwest and northwest corner and must leave
somewhere between the southeast and northeast corners.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

If Bill can complete the trip, give coordinates at which he may enter and leave the field. If Bill may
enter and leave at several places, give the most northerly. If there is no such pair of positions, print
Bill will be bitten.
