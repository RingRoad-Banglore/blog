title: Uva 11694  Gokigen Naname
---


## Input

```
Gokigen Naname is a Japanese puzzle game played on a square grid in which numbers in circles appear
at some of the intersections on the grid.

The objective is to draw diagonal lines in each cell of the grid, such that the number in each circle
equals the number of lines extending from that circle. Additionally, it is forbidden for the diagonal lines
to form an enclosed loop.

The first figure shows the start position of a puzzle. The second figure shows the solution to the
same puzzle. A Gokigen Naname puzzle always has exactly one solution.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N < 25) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2  n  7), the number of cells along
each of the sides in the square grid. Then follow n+1 lines containing the contents of the intersections
of the grid cells. Each such line will contain a string of n + 1 characters, either a digit between 0 and
4, inclusive, or a period (.) indicating that there is no number at this intersection (arbitrarily many
lines may connect to it).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print n lines, each line containing exactly n characters. Each character should either
be a slash or a backslash, denoting how the corresponding grid cell is filled.
