title: Uva 01177  A General Recurrence Relation
---


## Input

```
Consider the following recurrence relation defined on nonnegative integral values of n:

F (n) =




f0, if n = 0
f1, if n = 1
a F (n 1) + b F (n 2), otherwise

Here a and b are constants such that the following two conditions are satisfied:

(1) a2 + 4b > 0

(2) |a

a2 + 4b|  2

Given the values of f0, f1, a, b and n, your job is to write a program that calculates the value of
F (n). You may safely assume that F (n) will be an integer with absolute value not exceeding 109.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (1  N  10, 000) denoting the number of test
cases to follow.

Each of the following N lines contains five (5) values in the following order: f0, f1, a, b and n. Here,
f0 and f1 are integers with absolute values not exceeding 109, and n is a nonnegative integer not greater
than. On the other hand, a and b are floating-point numbers satisfying the two conditions stated in
the problem description. Be assured that |a|, |b|  106.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input file print a separate line containing the value of F (n).

```

## Sample Output

```
3
0 1 1 1 20
0 1 -1 0 1000000000
-1 1 4 -3 18

```
