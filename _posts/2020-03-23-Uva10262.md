10262 Suffidromes
Given two strings of lowercase letters, a and b, print the shortest string x of lowercase letters such that
exactly one (but not both) of ax or bx is a palindrome; that is, equal to itself when reversed.

## Input
Standard input contains several pairs of a and b. Each string is on a separate line and consists of
between 0 and 1,000 lowercase letters.

## Output
For each pair, output a line containing x. If several x satisfy the criteria above, choose the first one in
alphabetical order. If it doesn’t exist such a string x, print just ‘No solution.' as answer.

## Sample Input
<p>abab</p><p>ababab</p><p>abc</p><p>def</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>baba</p><p>ba</p>
