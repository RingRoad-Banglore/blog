Somewhere in the universe, Orez is a planet which has highly developed civilization and advanced tech-
nology. But unfortunately, a supernova which is near to Orez blossomed and emitted an extraordinary
radiation that may danger the civilization in Orez.

There is a great fleet of spaceship in the planet. The fleet has ONE battle-cruiser and several
fighters. A fighter can make a sphere magnetic shield which the radiation cant pass through. When
the fleet is in the space, the battle-cruiser and the magnetic shields can make shadows on the ground
if the radiation comes.

When the radiation hit the planet, people in Orez will be destroyed except they go into the shadow
of the fleet. So we want to know the area of the safety shadow.

To simplify this problem, you can consider that: the ground is an infinity plane, the radiation is
parallel light, a fighter is a point, and the battle-cruiser is a 3D convex hull.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of multiply test cases.

For each case, the first line contains five integers: N , M , Dx, Dy and Dz. N is the number of
fighters. M points in/on the battle-cruiser will be given later. The convex hull of these M points is the
shape of the battle-cruiser. (Dx,Dy,Dz) is the direction vector of the radiation. Dz is negative.

Each of the next N lines contains four integers Xi, Yi, Zi and Pi, representing a fighter. (Xi, Yi, Zi)
is the coordinate of the fighter (also the center of the sphere shield made by the fighter). Pi is the
radius of the shield.

Each of the next M lines contains three integers Xi, Yi and Zi. (Xi, YiZi) is a point in/on the
battle-cruiser.

All the Xi, Yi are in the range of [0, 100]; all the Zi are in the range of [20, 100]; 0  Pi  20;
N +M  500, and the ground is the plane Z = 0.

Please note that several fighters may stay at the same position, and a fighter can stay inside or on
the cruiser.

The input ends with 0 0 0 0 0.

## Output

```
For each case, print the area of shadow in a line. The result should be rounded to 4 digits after the
decimal point.
