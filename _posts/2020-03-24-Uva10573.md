## Input

```text
In the picture below you can see two small circles
touching each other. The larger circle touches both
of them. The length of the common tangent inscribed
inside the larger circle is t and the radiuses of the two
smaller circles are r1 and r2. The centers of the three
circles are collinear. You will be given the value of
r1 and r2 or the value of t. You will have to find the
area that is within the larger circle but out of the two
smaller circles (marked gray in the picture). If the
given data is not enough to find the gray area, print
the line Impossible. in a single line
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input file contains an integer N (N 
100) which denotes how many sets of inputs are there.
Each of the next N lines contain a set of input.

Each set either contains one or two integer. If it
contains one integer then it is the value of t, otherwise
the two values are the values of r1 and r2. All these integers are less than 100

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the area of the gray part if the given
information is enough to find the area of the gray part. Otherwise it contains the line Impossible.
The area should have four digits after the decimal point. Assume that  = 2  cos1(0).

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
10 10
15 20

```
