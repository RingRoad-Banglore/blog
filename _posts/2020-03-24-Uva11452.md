---


```

The Cheeky-Cheeky is a new song. They dance it in Mula, and also in Hong Kong. All the freekies
dance it, and the geek all love it. And the Cheeky-Cheeky is danced like this:

1. The breikin-brokin.

2. The meneito.

3. The roboqueitor.

4. The maiquel-guolkin.

In this problem you have to learn to dance the Cheeky-Cheeky. This dancing consists of 4 basic
steps (as listed above) that are arranged into a particular sequence. Then this sequence can be
repeated an arbitrary number of times.

For example, if the sequence is 123, then the Cheeky-Cheeky is danced like this:
12312312312312.... But if the sequence is 123124, then the steps of the dancing are
123124123124123....

You are given some of the steps of a particular dancing. Those steps will contain between 2 (inclusive)
and 3 (not inclusive) times the basic sequence. You have to continue the dancing.

For example, if the basic sequence is 123, we can have the following possibilities:

Input Output

123123 12312312...

1231231 23123123...

12312312 31231231...
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains an integer indicating the number of test cases.

Each case contains some of the first steps of a dancing. It is a single line with a list of digits (1, 2,
3 or 4) with no spaces between them. It will not have more than 2000 steps. Remember that the case
contains the basic sequence twice, and possibly has some more steps (but not thrice).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output should contain the 8 following steps of the dancing, followed by three
dots ....
