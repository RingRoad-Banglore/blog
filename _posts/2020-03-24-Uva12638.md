title: Uva 12638  Godels Dream

## Input

```

Once Godel dreamt about codes. And he foresaw a very interesting puzzle involving finite sequences of
bits called h-sequences. An h-sequence is a string defined recursively as follows:

hseq ::= 0
hseq ::= 1hseqhseq

For instance, 0, 11000, and 101100100 are h-sequences but 1, 11001, and 111100100 are not.

Godels dream was of a tall order of h-sequence fun because the strings had incomplete information.
More precisely, strings did not only contain bits 0 and 1, but they also contained the question mark
symbol ?. The occurrence of a question mark symbol in a string indicates that any bit can go in such
a position of the string. For example, the sequence 101?0 can actually have the h-sequence 10100 and
the string 10110 (which is not an h-sequence) as instances.

Given a string made of bits, possibly containing question mark symbols, your task is to write a
program that computes the maximum number of h-sequences that concatenated together result in an
instance of such a string.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases, each one defined by a line containing a string s made of
characters 0, 1, and ?, whose length is between 1 and 104 inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a line with the maximum number of h-sequences that concatenated together
result in an instance of s.

```

## Sample Output

```
0

10100

??1?

?1??

1?010100

???1????
