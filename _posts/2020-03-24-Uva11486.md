title: Uva 11486  Finding Paths in Grid
---


## Input

```

Given a grid having 7 columns. 4 players will start there journey in that grid. Initially all of them
are in first row. A player can move diagonally to the next row. For example, a player is in row 3 and
column 4, which can also be represented as (3,4), this player has only two valid moves, (4,3) and (4,5).
But If the player is in (3, 1), he has only one valid move, which is (4,2). In there journey, any cell of
the grid can not be visited more than one player.

In this problem you have to find, in how many ways all of the players can reach to row N .
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 100) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case starts
with a line containing only 1 integer N (1  N  1000000000), followed by a line having 7 integers (r1
to r7), which will represent the state of first row. ri = 0 represents that, there is no player in row i,
otherwise ri will represent the player number. Player numbers will be between 1 to 4.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the number of ways to reach row N . You have to give your output modulo
1000000007.
