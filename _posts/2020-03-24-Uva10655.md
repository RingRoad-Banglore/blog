```
Given the value of a+b and ab you will have to find the value of an + bn
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several lines of inputs. Each line except the last line contains 3 non-negative
integers p, q and n. Here p denotes the value of a+ b and q denotes the value of ab. Input is terminated
by a line containing only two zeroes. This line should not be processed. Each number in the input file
fits in a signed 32-bit integer. There will be no such input so that you have to find the value of 00.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. This line contains the value of
an + bn. You can always assume that an + bn fits in a signed 64-bit integer.

```

## Sample Input

```
10 16 2
7 12 3
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
68
91
```
