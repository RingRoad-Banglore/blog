title: Uva 00995  Super Divisible Numbers
---


```
A positive integer N is a super divisible number in the base B if and only if the number formed by the
k most significant base-B digits of N is divisible by k, for all k between 1 and the number of base-B
digits of N . (By definition, the most significant digit of N can not be 0.)

For example, 22203014 is a base-4 super divisible number because 24 is divisible by 1, 224 is divisible
by 2, 2224 is divisible by 3, 22204 is divisible by 4, 222034 is divisible by 5, 2220304 is divisible by 6,
and 22203014 is divisible by 7.

Find the largest super divisible number of a given base which uses only digits from a given list of
digits.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases. For each of them, the program input is a single line containing
the base and the list of valid digits. The base will always be an integer between 4 and 10. The list of
valid digits will have a length of at most 10, and may contain repeated digits (the repetitions should
be ignored).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the program output is a single line containing the largest super divisible number of
the given base which uses only the digits given on the input. It is known that the largest super divisible
number will not have more than 50 digits.
