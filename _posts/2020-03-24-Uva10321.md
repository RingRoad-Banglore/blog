title: Uva 10321  Polygon intersection
---


```
Given any two arbitrary polygons, determine their intersection if it exists.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several sets of input.

Each set will consist of two polygon description. Each polygon description begins with a positive
integer n corresponding to the number of vertices, followed by n lines with each line containing a pair
of integer (x, y) representing the x and y coordinates of a polygon vertex. The vertices will be given in
clockwise traversal order and no two polygon edges would overlap. You should terminate your program
if n < 3. You may assume all integer input is less than or equal to 100.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input follow the follow the output description below.

If the two convex polygons do not intersect then print out 0. Otherwise, print out the number
of intersecting points of the input polygons, followed by the points. The output must begin with the
bottom leftmost point and must be listed in lexicographical ordering. Your answers must be rounded
up to two digits after the decimal point

```
