title: Uva 11605  Lights inside a 3D Grid
---


```
You are given a 3D grid, which have dimensions N , M and P . Each of the M N P cells has a light.
Initially all lights are off. You will have K turns. In each of the K turns,

 You will select a cell A randomly from the grid

 You will select a cell B randomly from the grid

 Toggle the states of all the bulbs bounded by cell A and cell B, ie make all the ON lights OFF and
make all the OFF lights ON which are bounded by A and B. To be more clear, consider cell A is
(x1, y1, z1) and cell B is (x2, y2, z2). Then you have to toggle all the bulbs in grid cell (x, y, z) where
min(x1, x2)  x  max(x1, x2), min(y1, y2)  y  max(y1, y2) and min(z1, z2)  z  max(z1, z2).

How many bulbs are expected to be ON after K turns?

Note: A and B can be the same cell.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input is an integer T (T < 101) which denotes the number of test cases. Each of the next
T lines represents one test case by 4 integers N , M , P (0 < M,N,P < 101) and K (0  K  10000)
separated by spaces.

```

## Output

```
Output one line for each test cases giving the expected number of ON lights. Up to 1E-6 error in your
output will be acceptable. Print the case number followed by the output. Look at the sample output
for exact format.

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 6.3750000000
Case 2: 9.0976562500
