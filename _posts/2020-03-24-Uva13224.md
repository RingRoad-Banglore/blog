title: Uva 13224  Hobbits Resistor Graphs
---


## Input

```
Hobbit has only learnt the parallel and series method of calculating resistance across an electric network
graph where there is a single resister on every edge of the undirected graph G.

Given an undirected graph G, and 2 vertices u and v, if it is possible to calculate the resistance
between u and v using only these 2 rules shown above, then the graph G is called series-parallel
decomposible (spdecomposible for short) with respect to (u, v). In other words, G may be turned into
just the 2 node graph of u, v connected by one edge, by a sequence of the following operations:

(a) Replacement of a pair of parallel edges with a single edge that connects their common endpoints;

(b) Replacement of a pair of edges incident to a vertex of degree 2 other than u or v with a single
edge.
```

## Output

```
The input contains multiple sets of data. The first line of each set contains 2 positive integers n
(1  n  100000), and m (1  m  100000), which represent the number of nodes and the number of
edges/resistors in the resistor network. Then, a total of m lines follows with each resister edge (u, v),
such that (1  u, v  n, u = v).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of data, output on one line the number of unique pairs (u, v) with u < v, such that G is
spdecomposible with respect to (u, v).
