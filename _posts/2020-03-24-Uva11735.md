title: Uva 11735  Corner the Queens
---


```
Corner the queen is a game played on n  n chess like board
with two players. The rows and columns are numbered from
0 to n  1. Then a queen is placed on a random cell other
than (0, 0). Each player gives one move of the queen towards
the cell (0, 0). The move is like a chess queen. As you know
a queen can move any number of cells horizontally, vertically
or diagonally. In Formal a player can move a queen from cell
(a1, b1) to cell (a2, b2) if (a1 = a2 or b1 = b2 or |a1  a2| =
|b1 b2|). Moreover in this game, move that takes queen away
from the cell (0, 0) horizontally or vertically or diagonally is not
allowed. Formally, if a player moves queen from cell (a1, b1) to
(a2, b2) then (a2  a1 and b2  b1) must be held. The player
who first reaches the cell (0, 0) is the winner. Now you may
already have guessed if both the players play optimally, the starting position determines the winner.
For some cell like (2, 0) player 1 always wins and for some cell like (1, 2) player 2 always wins.

In this problem we consider an infinite chess board for playing the game. A rectangular region is
specified. A cell from that region will be picked randomly as a starting position for the queen. All you
have to find is the probability that player 1 wins assuming that both players will play optimally.

## Input

```
The first line of input will be a number T (T  15000) the number of test cases. Each of the following
T lines will contain four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 (0  x1  x2  1000000, 0  y1  y2  1000000). Here
(x1, y1) is the lower left and (x2, y2) is the upper right portion of the rectangle. The lowest-leftmost
cell is (0, 0) and it is always outside the given rectangle.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output in the format Board X: n / d. Here X is the
number of case, n and d is the numerator and denominator of the probability expressed in reduced
form. See the sample input and output for illustration.
