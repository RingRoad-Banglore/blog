title: Uva 12895  Armstrong Number
---


## Input

```text
A number N is an Armstrong number of order n (n being the number of digits) if

abcd . . . = an + bn + cn + dn + . . . = N

For example, 153 is an Armstrong number of order 3 because

13 + 53 + 33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.

Likewise, 54748 is an Armstrong number of order 5 because

55 + 45 + 75 + 45 + 85 = 3125 + 1024 + 16807 + 1024 + 32768 = 54748.

In this problem you have to determine whether a given number is Armstrong number or not.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input is an integer, T that determines the number of test cases. Each of the next T
lines contain a positive integer N , where N  1000000000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input, there will be one line of output. If N is an Armstrong number print Armstrong,
otherwise print Not Armstrong (without the quotes).
