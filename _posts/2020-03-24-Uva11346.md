## Input

```text
Consider rectangular coordinate system and point L(X,Y ) which is randomly chosen among all points
in the area A which is defined in the following manner: A = {(x, y)|x  [a; a]; y  [b; b]}. What is
the probability P that the area of a rectangle that is defined by points (0,0) and (X,Y ) will be greater
than S?
```

## Output

```text
The number of tests N  200 is given on the first line of input. Then N lines with one test case on
each line follow. The test consists of 3 real numbers a > 0, b > 0 ir S  0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case you should output one number P and percentage % symbol following that number
on a single line. P must be rounded to 6 digits after decimal point.

```

## Sample Output

```text

10 5 20
1 1 1
2 2 0
