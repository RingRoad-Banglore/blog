title: Uva 13207  AirCraft Monster
---


## Input

```
AirCraft, the popular aviation video game has released its new version with more monstrous challenges
than ever: AirCraft: Monster, abbreviated by its fans as ACM. In each successful mission the players
will receive an exact amount of experience points (XP ), attack points (AP ) and defense points (DP ),
which will accumulate in their profiles. The Missions in ACM doesnt have a specific order: The player
can choose in which order to play them. A mission only gives points the first time it is surpassed, so it
is not possible to win points twice with the same mission.

ACM awards medals for certain action. The most sought medal is the Monster Player. To win
this medal, the player must accumulate EXACTLY x experience points, a attack points and d defense
points. However, some users have complained, they said that its not possible to get exactly these scores
with any possible combination of successful missions.

Given the x, a and d points needed to win the Monster Player Medal and knowing the XP , AP y
DP that every mission awards, is it possible to win the medal, and therefore become a Monster Player?
```

## Output

defense points needed to win the medal and the number of missions of the game. Then m lines come,
each one describing a mission of ACM. A mission consist of a string s (s containing no white spaces),
