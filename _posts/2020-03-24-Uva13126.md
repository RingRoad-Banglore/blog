```
Alice and Bob are playing a game: Alice selects a text t and a word w, and then Bob has to say how
many times w occurs in t. However, after a while, Alice realizes that this version of the game is too
boring for Bob and decides to make a modification: in her new version of the game, the wildcard symbol
? can occur in w any number of times. Each occurrence of ? in w can be matched with any character
in t.

In the new version of the game, for instance, if the text is t = banana and the word is w = ?a?,
then w occurs twice in t: at position 0 matching ban and at position 2 matching nan. Notice that
matches can overlap.

Can you write a program to help Bob solve this new game?
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases, each one defined by two lines. The first line contains the text
t and the second line contains the word w. The text t consists of lowercase letters from the English
alphabet (1  |t|  105), and the word w consists of lowercase letters from the English alphabet and
the wildcard character ? (1  |w|  105). It is guaranteed that there will be at most k wildcard
characters in w, where 0  k  min

(
|w|, 106/|t|

)
.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line with one integer denoting the number of times w appears in t if each
wildcard character matches any character in t.
