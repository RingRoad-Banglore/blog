```

Most financial institutions had become insolvent during financial crisis and went bankrupt or were
bought by larger institutions, usually by banks. By the end of financial crisis of all the financial
institutions only two banks still continue to operate. Financial markets had remained closed throughout
the crisis and now regulators are gradually opening them. To prevent speculation and to gradually ramp
up trading they will initially allow trading in only one financial instrument and the volume of trading
will be limited to i contracts for i-th minute of market operation.

Two banks had decided to cooperate with the government to kick-start the market operation. The
boards of directors had agreed on trading volume for each minute of this first trading session. One
bank will be buying ai contracts (1  ai  i) during i-th minute (1  i  n), while the other one will
be selling. They do not really care whether to buy or to sell, and the outside observer will only see the
volume ai of contracts traded per minute. However, they do not want to take any extra risk and want
to have no position in the contract by the end of the trading session. Thus, if we define bi = 1 when
the first bank is buying and bi = 1 when the second one is buying (and the first one is selling), then
the requirement for the trading session is that

n
i=1 aibi = 0.

Your lucky team of three still works in the data center (due to the crisis, banks now share the data
center and its personnel) and your task is to find such bi or to report that this is impossible.
