10098 Generating Fast, Sorted Permutation
Generating permutation has always been an important problem in computer science. In this problem
you will have to generate the permutation of a given string in ascending order. Remember that your
algorithm must be efficient.

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer n, which indicates how many strings to follow. The next
n lines contain n strings. Strings will only contain alpha numerals and never contain any space. The
maximum length of the string is 10.

## Output
For each input string print all the permutations possible in ascending order. Not that the strings should
be treated, as case sensitive strings and no permutation should be repeated. A blank line should follow
each output set.

## Sample Input
<p>3</p><p>ab</p><p>abc</p><p>bca</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>ab</p><p>ba</p><p></p><p>abc</p><p>acb</p><p>bac</p><p>bca</p><p>cab</p><p>cba</p><p></p><p>abc</p><p>acb</p><p>bac</p><p>bca</p><p>cab</p><p>cba</p>
