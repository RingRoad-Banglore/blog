## Input

```
In this problem we will discuss the problems of a modern Romeo and a modern Juliet. You are asked
to solve their problems so that they dont have to be a tragic pair like that of Shakespeares. As usual
the family of Romeo and Juliet have hostile relationships and so they are locked up in two different
places M and N . Two cannons are placed in location A and two cannons are placed in location B. One
cannon of location A is aimed towards M and the other aimed towards N . The same thing applies to
the two cannons of location B. The M and N are always on the opposite side of AB.

Fig: Partial Scenario of Romeo & Juliet

The movements of the cannons, which are aimed at M , are interrelated; the angle between their
directions is constant. So angle CMD ((5 degree)  (angle CMD) < (80 degree)) is constant. Same
rule applies to the other two cannons. Thats angle ENF ((5 degree)  (angle ENF ) < (80 degree)) is
also constant. All these things are shown in the picture above. But another important thing is missing
in the figure above is that the locations N , A, M are always kept in a straight line. The reason behind
this is very strange. A robot has been hired to guard Romeo and Juliet. It has two eyes at the opposite
sides of its head and this robot is positioned in point A. To be precise, A, B and angle CMD and angle
ENF are constants in one scenario and all other positions or values are variable. Also remember that
point M must always remain pointed by the two cannons. Same thing applies to point N .

The problem is that in starry nights Mr. Romeo sings the song Blue Nights of Michael Learns to
Rock in a loud voice and both parents dont want Ms.Juliet to hear this song. So they want to place
the houses (M and N) as far as possible preserving all the constraints explained before. Your job is
to measure this maximum distance between M and N and inform it to Romeo, so that he can decide
whether he should sing or not or what should be his voice level.

## Output

```
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains six floating-point numbers, x1, y1, x2,
and y2 (0  x1, y1, x2, y2  10000) CMD, ENF . Here (x1, y1) is the coordinate of A, (x2, y2) is the
coordinate of B, CMD is the angle between the directions of cannons pointed towards M and ENF is
the similar value for point N . Input is terminated by end-of-file.

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input you should produce one line of output, which contains a floating-point number F .
F is the maximum possible distance between Romeos house and Juliets house and it has three digits
after the decimal point.
