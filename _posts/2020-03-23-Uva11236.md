11236 Grocery store
A cashier in a grocery store seems to have difficulty in distinguishing the multiplication symbol and the
addition symbol. To make things easier for him, you want to buy goods in such a way that the product
of their prices is the same as the sum of their prices.

Of course, if you buy only one item, this is always true. With two items and three items, it still
seems quite a boring task to you, so now you are interested in finding possible prices of four items such
that the sum of the four prices is equal to the product of the four prices. You should consider the prices
are in e; with two digits after the decimal point. Obviously, each product costs at least one cent.

## Input
This problem has no input.

## Output
Print all solutions which have a sum of the four items of at most 20.00 e. For each solution, print one
line with the prices of the four items in non-decreasing order, with one space character between them.
You may print the solutions in any order, but make sure to print each solution only once.
