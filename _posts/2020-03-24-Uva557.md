title: Uva 00557  Burger
---


```
When Mr. and Mrs. Clintons twin sons Ben and Bill had their tenth birthday, the party was held
at the McDonalds restaurant at South Broadway 202, New York. There were 20 kids at the party,
including Ben and Bill. Ronald McDonald had made 10 hamburgers and 10 cheeseburgers and when he
served the kids he started with the girl directly sitting left of Bill. Ben was sitting to the right of Bill.
Ronald flipped a (fair) coin to decide if the girl should have a hamburger or a cheeseburger, head for
hamburger, tail for cheeseburger. He repeated this procedure with all the other 17 kids before serving
Ben and Bill last. Though, when coming to Ben he didnt have to flip the coin anymore because there
were no cheeseburgers left, only 2 hamburgers.

Ronald McDonald was quite surprised this happened, so he would like to know what the probability
is of this kind of events. Calculate the probability that Ben and Bill will get the same type of burger
using the procedure described above. Ronald McDonald always grills the same number of hamburgers
and cheeseburgers.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input-file contains the number of problems n , followed by n times:

a line with an even number [2,4,6,...,100000], which indicates the number of guests present at the party
including Ben and Bill.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of n lines with on each line the probability (4 decimals precise) that Ben and Bill
get the same type of burger.

Note: a variance of 0.0001 is allowed in the output due to rounding differences.
