title: Uva 11431  Partitioning a Number
---


```
Let f(n) be the number of ways to write n as a sum of powers of 2. Each power can be used at most
twice For example, there are five ways to partition 10:

8+2, 8+1+1, 4+4+2, 4+4+1+1, 4+2+2+1+1

So we have f(10) = 5.
Given n, find the maximal value among f(0), f(1), . . . , f(n).
```

## Input

```
The input contains at most 1000 test cases. Each test case contains a single line containing an integer
n (1  n  1018). The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the maximal value from f(0) to f(n). Look at the output
for sample input for details.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
10
87
3456
1000000000
0

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 5
Case 3: 21
Case 4: 233
Case 5: 1346269
```
