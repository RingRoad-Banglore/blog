---


## Input

```text

You have n marbles of different colors which are distributed in 2 boxes. In each move you can move one
marble from one box into another. You have to move the marbles in such a way that first box contains
each combination of marble sets exactly once. There are 2n combinations of marbles.

For example you have 4 marbles. Box 1 has marbles of color 1 and 3. And Box 2 has marbles of
color 2 and 4. Then the solution can be as follows.

Steps Box 1 marbles Move Box 2 marbles

1 1,3 2,4

2 1,2,3 Move 2 from B2 to B1 4

3 1,2,3,4 Move 4 from B2 to B1

4 1,2,4 Move 3 from B1 to B2 3

5 2,4 Move 1 from B1 to B2 1,3

6 2,3,4 Move 3 from B2 to B1 1

7 3,4 Move 2 from B1 to B2 1,2

8 4 Move 3 from B1 to B2 1,2,3

9 Move 4 from B1 to B2 1,2,3,4

10 3 Move 3 from B2 to B1 1,2,4

11 2,3 Move 2 from B2 to B1 1,4

12 2 Move 3 from B1 to B2 1,3,4

13 1,2 Move 1 from B2 to B1 3,4

14 1 Move 2 from B1 to B2 2,3,4

15 1,4 Move 4 from B2 to B1 2,3

16 1,3,4 Move 3 from B2 to B1 2
