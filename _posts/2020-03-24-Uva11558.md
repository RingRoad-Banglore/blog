title: Uva 11558  Dinner

## Input

```text
For several years now, the Nordic Conference on Partitions and Combina-
torics, NCPC, has had a growing number of participants. This year the
organizing team is expecting an all time high record in the hundreds. Due
to the politics of arranging this prestigious event, the conference site was de-
cided a long time ago to be the Grand Htel in Stockholm. The hotel has
two large dining halls, but unfortunately, each of these halls alone can only
fit up to two thirds of the NCPC participants, so the participants are going
to have to be divided in two groups.

This constraint calls for some thinking on behalf of the organizing team
for the conference dinner: could they come up with some division of the
participants in two parts, none of which is larger than 2/3 of the entire group,
meeting some witty division rule suitable for the occasion, which they could
tell the participants for their amusement? After all, as long as there is some
grand logic rule to which of the two dining halls you are being seated in, you (as a mathematician)
would be happy! They thought for a while and came up with the following idea for the division: Is
there a year Y and a division of the participants in two parts such that every pair in the first part
met for the first time some time before year Y , and every pair in the second part met for the first time
some time in or after year Y ? Now this clearly qualified as an appropriate rule to all of them, but the
question was whether it would be possible?

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of input contains an integer 4  n  400, the number of participants, and c, the
number of known first encounters. The next c lines are each in the format a b y, meaning participant
a and b (1  a < b  n) met for the first time in year y (1948  y < 2008). No pair of participants
will appear more than once on the list, and every pair of participants not in the list is assumed to have
meet only now (in the year 2008).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, write to the output on a line by itself, either the smallest year Y such that it is
possible to divide the participants in two parts, neither of which contains more than 2n/3 people, such
that all people in the first part first met before year Y , and all people in the second part first met in or
after year Y . If there is no such year, output the string Impossible.
