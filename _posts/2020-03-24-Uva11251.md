```
You might find it interesting that the digits 1, 2, 9 may be arranged to form two decimal numbers
whose ratio is 1

2
, 1
3
, 1
4
, . . . 1

9
. For example:

7293

14586
=

1

2
,
5832

17496
=

1

3
, . . . ,

6381

57429
=

1

9

This fact is also true for most other number systems. So in general we can say that the digits
1, 2, . . . , D may be arranged to form two (D + 1) based numbers whose ratio is 1

2
, 1
3
, 1
4
, . . . 1

D
. In this

problem you will be asked to find such fractions. In other words given the base B and denominator
N you will have to find two B-based integers P and Q (Both of them combined should use the digits
1, 2, 3, . . . , B  1 exactly once.) such that:

P

Q
=

1

N

You can safely assume that the digits larger than value 9 are represented by capital English letters
starting from A. So the digits of 12 based number system are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A,
B (Zeros are not allowed in this problem). Similarly, the digits of 27 based number system are 1, 2,
3, . . ., L, M, N, O, P, Q.

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 300 lines of inputs. Each line contains two decimal integers B (1 < B <
28) and N (1 < N < B).

Input is terminated by a set where the value of B and N is zero. This set should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the two input values followed by
two B-based integers separated by a / (front slash). The two B-based integers denote the values of P
and Q respectively. So they actually denote the fraction P

Q
. There will be no such inputs for which P

and Q cannot be found. If there is more than one solution any one of them will do.

```

## Sample Input

```
10 2
10 9
14 4
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
10 2 7932/15864
10 9 8361/75249
14 4 CD5621/39B7A84
```
