title: Uva 11059  Maximum Product
---


```
Given a sequence of integers S = {S1, S2, . . . , Sn}, you should determine what is the value of the
maximum positive product involving consecutive terms of S. If you cannot find a positive sequence,
you should consider 0 as the value of the maximum product.
```

## Input

```
Each test case starts with 1  N  18, the number of elements in a sequence. Each element Si is an
integer such that 10  Si  10. Next line will have N integers, representing the value of each element
in the sequence. There is a blank line after each test case. The input is terminated by end of file (EOF).

```

## Output

```
For each test case you must print the message: Case #M: The maximum product is P., where M
is the number of the test case, starting from 1, and P is the value of the maximum product. After each
test case you must print a blank line.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
2 4 -3

5
2 5 -1 2 -1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case #1: The maximum product is 8.

Case #2: The maximum product is 20.
