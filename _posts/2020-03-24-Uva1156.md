title: Uva 01156  Pixel Shuffle
---


```
Shuffling the pixels in a bitmap image sometimes yields ran-
dom looking images. However, by repeating the shuffling enough
times, one finally recovers the original images. This should be no
surprise, since shuffling means applying a one-to-one mapping
(or permutation) over the cells of the image, which come in finite
number.

Your program should read a number n, and a series of el-
ementary transformations that define a shuffling  of n  n
images. Then, your program should compute the minimal num-
ber m (m > 0), such that m applications of  always yield the
original n n image.

For instance if  is counter-clockwise 90o rotation then m = 4.

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

Input is made of two lines, the first line is number n (2  n  210, n even). The number n is the size
of images, one image is represented internally by a n n pixel matrix (aji ), where i is the row number
and j is the column number. The pixel at the upper left corner is at row 0 and column 0.

The second line is a non-empty list of at most 32 words, separated by spaces. Valid words are the
keywords id, rot, sym, bhsym, bvsym, div and mix, or a keyword followed by -. Each keyword
key designates an elementary transform (as defined by Figure 1), and key- designates the inverse of
transform key. For instance, rot- is the inverse of counter-clockwise 90o rotation, that is clockwise 90o
rotation. Finally, the list k1, k2, . . . , kp designates the compound transform  = k1  k2      kp. For
instance, bvsym rot- is the transform that first performs clockwise 90o rotation and then vertical
symmetry on the lower half of the image.

bhsym , horizontal symmetry applied to the lower half of image : when

bvsym , vertical symmetry applied to the lower half of image (i  n/2)

div , division. Rows 0, 2, . . . , n  2 become rows 0, 1, . . . n/2  1, while
rows 1, 3, . . . n 1 become rows n/2, n/2 + 1, . . . n 1.

## Output

```
For each test case, your program should output a single line whose contents is the minimal number m
(m > 0) such that m is the identity. You may assume that, for all test input, you have m < 231.

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
