title: Uva 11415  Count the Factorials
---


## Input

```
Ram is a bright boy who is very much interested in number theory. He was studying about factorials
of numbers, and got some interesting idea.

Being a brilliant coder, he started writing a program and implemented the following routines :

 fact(n)  This function returns the value of n!, where n  0
eg. fact(5) returns 120

 count(n)  This function returns the number of terms in the prime factorisation of n, where
n  0.
eg. count(24) returns 4 (because, 24 = 2  2  2  3). The prime factorisation of 24 contains 4
terms

 func(n)  This function is explained below.

Ram wrote the function func as follows:

int func(int $n$)
{
int ans = 0;
for(int $i=0$; ; $i++$)
{
if( count( fact( $i$ ) ) $\le n$)
ans++;
else
return ans;
}
}

The above procedure takes too much time to execute. Help Ram by writing a more efficient solution
that does the same function as func does.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of test cases t.

The next t lines contains a positive integer, representing n (1  t  1000, 1  n  10000000).

```

## Sample Input

```
Print func(n) for the given n, on a line by itself.
Note: Consider 1 as a prime number.

```

## Sample Output

```
4
1
2
3
4
