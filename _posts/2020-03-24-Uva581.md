## Input

```text
Word search is a game enjoyed by all ages. The basic idea is to find certain specified words within a
given matrix of letters.

One interesting means of constructing a word search matrix is to take some written text (in upper
case), strip out all but the characters A..Z, and format the resulting sequence of characters into columns
of s characters. That is, taking s = 9 and given the text

Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits and
Are melted into air, into thin air:
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-cappd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.
We obtain the following word-search matrix:

ONERIYLNEIITSFODEGCESGLHEDNSNAEAWSEDRFEE

We can now search this matrix for words. For example, the word SAFE can be found starting at
lexicographic position 246 and running eastward in the text (by lexicographic position we mean the
numerical position with the search matrix when counting consecutively and column-wise from the first
character, which is position 0). Since, running row-wise, we are looking at every sth character, the
value of s is sometimes called a skip value.

For this problem, you will be given search words, a search text, and a skip value. Your job (well,
really, your programs job) is to find the location of each of the search words within the search text,
formatted into a search matrix according to the given skip value.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input is an integer K, then a blank line followed by K datasets. There is a blank
line between datasets.

The first line of each dataset contains a single integer specifying the skip value to use in doing the
word search. The second line will contain a single integer m specifying the number of words to search
for. The next m lines will contain the words to search for, one word per line. The words will be given
in all uppercase. No word will be more than 32 characters in length. There will be a maximum of 128

search words. After the search words will be a line containing a single integer n giving the number of
lines in the search text. The next n lines contain the search text.

No line of search text will be more than 128 characters long. All characters in the text will be upper
case. There will be a maximum of 5452 lines (the number of lines in Hamlet).

```

## Sample Input

```text
Each line of output should contain a search word, the lexicographical location of the first character
of the word in the search text, and its orientation (the direction in which the rest of characters are
oriented with respect to the first character).

Valid directions are N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW, in that order of precedence, indicating
text running in the corresponding directions within the word search text matrix. If a word occurs more
than once in the search matrix, you should print out only the location with the lowest lexicographical
position of the first letter. The words in the output should be ordered as given in the input. Each line
of output should contain the search word, followed by a space, then the lexicographic position of the
word, followed by another space, and finally the direction that word runs in the search text. If a word
is not found in the search matrix, the line should contain the word followed by a space and then the
text NOT FOUND.

Print a blank line between datasets.

OUR REVELS NOW ARE ENDED. THESE OUR ACTORS,
AS I FORETOLD YOU, WERE ALL SPIRITS, AND
ARE MELTED INTO AIR, INTO THIN AIR:
AND, LIKE THE BASELESS FABRIC OF THIS VISION,
THE CLOUD-CAPP'D TOWERS, THE GORGEOUS PALACES,
THE SOLEMN TEMPLES, THE GREAT GLOBE ITSELF,
YEA, ALL WHICH IT INHERIT, SHALL DISSOLVE,
AND, LIKE THIS INSUBSTANTIAL PAGEANT FADED,
LEAVE NOT A RACK BEHIND. WE ARE SUCH STUFF
AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON; AND OUR LITTLE LIFE
IS ROUNDED WITH A SLEEP.
