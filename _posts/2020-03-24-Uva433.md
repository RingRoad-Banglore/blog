title: Uva 00433  Bank Not Quite OCR
---


```
Banks, always trying to increase their profit, asked their computer experts to come up with a system
that can read bank cheques; this would make the processing of cheques cheaper. One of their ideas was
to use optical character recognition (ocr) to recognize bank accounts printed using 7 line-segments.

Once a cheque has been scanned, some image processing software would convert the horizontal and
vertical bars to ASCII bars | and underscores _.

The ASCII 7-segment versions of the ten digits look like this:

A bank account has a 9-digit account number with a checksum. For a valid account number, the
following equation holds: (d1 + 2 d2 + 3 d3 +   + 9 d9) mod 11 = 0. Digits are numbered from
right to left like this: d9d8d7d6d5d4d3d2d1.

Unfortunately, the scanner sometimes makes mistakes: some line-segments may be missing. Your
task is to write a program that deduces the original number, assuming that:

 when the input represents a valid account number, it is the original number;

 at most one digit is garbled;

 the scanned image contains no extra segments.

For example, the following input

_ _ _ _ _ _ _
| _| _||_||_ |_ ||_||_|
| _ _| | _||_| ||_| _|

used to be 123456789.
```

## Input

```
The input file starts with a line with one integer specifying the number of account numbers that have
to be processed. Each account number occupies 3 lines of 27 characters.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output contains one line with 9 digits if the correct account number can be
determined, the string failure if no solutions were found and ambiguous if more than one solution
was found.
