```

Solitaire is a game played on a chessboard 88. The rows and columns of the chessboard are numbered
from 1 to 8, from the top to the bottom and from left to right, respectively.

There are four identical pieces on the board. In one move it is allowed to:

 move a piece to an empty neighboring field (up, down, left or right),

 jump over one neighboring piece to an empty field (up, down, left or right).

Exactly 4 moves are allowed for each piece in the figure above. As an example lets consider a piece
placed in the row 4, column 4. It can be moved one row up, two rows down, one column left or two
columns right.

Write a program that:

 reads two chessboard configurations from the standard input,

 verifies whether the second one is reachable from the first one in at most 8 moves,

 writes the result to the standard output.
```

## Input

```
Each of two input lines contains 8 integers a1, a2, . . . , a8 separated by single spaces and describes one
configuration of pieces on the chessboard. Integers a2j1 and a2j (1  j  4) describe the position of
one piece  the row number and the column number respectively.

```

## Output

```
The output should contain one word YES if the configuration described in the second input line is
reachable from the configuration described in the first input line in at most 8 moves, and one word NO
otherwise.
