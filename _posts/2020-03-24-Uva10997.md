## Input

```text
At the Olympic Games, countries are ranked accord-
ing to the number of medals their athletes won. How-
ever, there is more than one possible way of rank-
ing countries by their medals. In Europe, for exam-
ple, countries are first ranked by the number of gold
medals their athletes won. Ties are broken by look-
ing at silver medals, and then at bronze medals. In
Canada, however, because Canadian athletes do not
win very many gold medals, countries are ranked by
the overall number of medals won, giving the same
weight to gold, silver, and bronze medals.

In general, a ranking scheme can be thought of as
a vector of positive weights. This vector is multiplied
with the vector of medals won by each country, and
the scalar product of the two vectors defines the score
of the respective country, which is then used to produce the ranking. In this general scheme, the
European ranking technique corresponds to the weight vector (1020, 1010, 1), whereas the Canadian
method corresponds to the vector (1, 1, 1).

In this problem, you will only need to consider weight vectors of the form (1/nj , 1/nk, 1/nl), where
n is the total number of medals won by all athletes in the Olympic Games, and j, k, and l are integers.

## Output

```text
The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer c, the number of countries
to follow. Each of the following c lines contains the name of a country and three integers g, s, and b 
the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won by the country. The last test case has c = 0 and must
not be processed. It is guaranteed that each test case contains at most 20 different countries and that
the total number of medals smaller than 100. Country names do not contain whitespace characters.

## Sample Input

```text
Given a list of countries and the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each country, print
the line

Canada wins!

if there is a weight vector of the above form such that Canada ranks first according to the ranking
scheme defined by that vector. Print the line

Canada cannot win.

if no such vector exists.
