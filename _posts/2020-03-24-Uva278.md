title: Uva 00278  Chess
---


## Input

```
Almost everyone knows the problem of putting eight queens on an 88 chessboard such that no Queen
can take another Queen. Jan Timman (a famous Dutch chessplayer) wants to know the maximum
number of chesspieces of one kind which can be put on an m  n board with a certain size such that
no piece can take another. Because its rather difficult to find a solution by hand, he asks your help to
solve the problem.

He doesnt need to know the answer for every piece. Pawns seems rather uninteresting and he
doesnt like Bishops anyway. He only wants to know how many Rooks, Knights, Queens or Kings can
be placed on one board, such that one piece cant take any other.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains the number of problems. A problem is stated on one line and consists of
one character from the following set r, k, Q, K, meaning respectively the chesspieces Rook, Knight,
Queen or King. The character is followed by the integers m (4  m  10) and n (4  n  10), meaning
the number of rows and the number of columns or the board.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each problem specification in the input your program should output the maximum number of
chesspieces which can be put on a board with the given formats so they are not in position to take any
other piece.

Note: The bottom left square is 1, 1.

```
