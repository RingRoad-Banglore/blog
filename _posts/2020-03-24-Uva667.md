title: Uva 00667  Fence
---


## Input

```
There is an area bounded by a fence on some flat field.
The fence has the height h and in the plane projection
it has a form of a closed polygonal line (without self-
intersections), which is specified by Cartesian coordi-
nates (Xi, Yi) of its N vertices. At the point with co-
ordinates (0, 0) a lamp stands on the field. The lamp
may be located either outside or inside the fence, but
not on its side as it is shown in the following sample
pictures (parts shown in a thin line are not illumi-
nated by the lamp):

The fence is perfectly black, i.e. it is neither reflecting, nor diffusing, nor letting the light through.
Research and experiments showed that the following law expresses the intensity of light falling on an
arbitrary illuminated point of this fence:

I0 =
k

r
,

where k is a known constant value not depending on the point in question, r is the distance between
this point and the lamp in the plane projection. The illumination of an infinitesimal narrow vertical
board with the width dl and the height h is

dI = I0 | cos a | dl  h ,

where I0 is the intensity of light on that board of the fence, a is the angle in the plane projection
between the normal to the side of the fence at this point and the direction to the lamp.

You are to write a program that will find the total illumination of the fence that is defined as the
sum of illuminations of all its illuminated boards.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input is an integer M , then a blank line followed by M datasets. There is a blank
line between datasets.

The first line of each dataset contains the numbers k, h and N , separated by spaces. k and h are
real constants. N (3  N  100) is the number of vertices of the fence. Then N lines follow, every line
contains two real numbers Xi and Yi, separated by a space.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset, write to the output the total illumination of the fence rounded to the second digit
after the decimal point.

Print a blank line between datasets.
