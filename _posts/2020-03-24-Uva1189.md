title: Uva 01189  Find the multiple
---


## Input

```text
Given a positive integer n, write a program to find out a nonzero multiple m of n whose decimal
representation contains only the digits 0 and 1. You may assume that n is not greater than 200 and
there is a corresponding m containing no more than 100 decimal digits.
```

## Output

```text
The input file may contain multiple test cases. Each line contains a value of n (1  n  200). A line
containing a zero (0) terminates the input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each value of n in the input print a line containing the corresponding value of m. The decimal
representation of m must not contain more than 100 digits. If there are multiple solutions for a given
value of n, any one of them is acceptable.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
6
19
0

```
