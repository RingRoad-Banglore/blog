---


## Input

```text

A sequence consisting of one digit, the number 1 is initially written into a computer. At each successive
time step, the computer simultaneously tranforms each digit 0 into the sequence 1 0 and each digit 1
into the sequence 0 1. So, after the first time step, the sequence 0 1 is obtained; after the second,
the sequence 1 0 0 1, after the third, the sequence 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 and so on.

How many pairs of consequitive zeroes will appear in the sequence after n steps?
```

## Output

```text
Every input line contains one natural number n (0 < n  1000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input n print the number of consequitive zeroes pairs that will appear in the sequence after n
steps.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2

3

```
