## Input

```text
We are observing someone playing the game of Mastermind. The object of this game is to find a secret
code by intelligent guess work, assisted by some clues. In this case the secret code is a 4-digit number
in the inclusive range from 0000 to 9999, say 3321. The player makes a first random guess, say 1223
and then, as for each of the future guesses, gets a clue telling him how good his guess is. A clue consists
of two numbers: the number of correct digits (in this case 1: the 2 at the third position) and the
additional number of digits guessed correctly but in the wrong place (in this case 2: the 1 and the
3). The clue would in this case be: 1/2.

Write a program that given a set of guesses and corresponding clues, tries to find the secret code.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input specifies the number of test cases (N) your program has to process. Each test
case consists of a first line containing the number of guesses G (0  G  10), and G subsequent lines
consisting of exactly 8 characters: a code of four digits, a blank, a digit indicating the number of correct
digits, a / and a digit indicating the number of correct but misplaced digits.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output contains a single line saying either:

 impossible if there is no code consistent with all guesses.

 the secret code if there is exactly one code consistent with all guesses.

 indeterminate if there is more than one code which is consistent with all guesses.

```
