title: Uva 11617  An Odd Love
---


## Input

```
Spring has arrived and our friend Pepito has fallen in love. But he is not sure if she also loves him, so
he decides to ask the daisies. He takes a daisy and alternately speaks the phrases She loves me and
She loves me not, while picking one petal off the flower for each phrase. The phrase corresponding
to the last petal tells him whether his love is reciprocated or not.

We want to help Pepito to always obtain the answer She loves me. Therefore, we will make sure
that all the daisies have an odd number of petals, by picking one petal off the flowers with an even
number.

We have a rectangular field of daisies, whose width is W and height H. There is a daisy in each
position of this field (w, h), with w = 1, 2, . . . ,W , and h = 1, 2, . . . , H. We have patiently counted the
number of petals of each daisy, P [w, h].

Starting from the upper-left corner of the field  i.e., from position (1, 1)  you have to pass
through all positions of daisies with an even number of petals. If your current position is (w, h), you
can only do three movements: go down (h+ 1), go left (w  1) and go right (w + 1).

Your task is to compute the minimum number of movements necessary to pass through all positions
with an even number of petals.

A sample case with W = 5 and H = 3. The solution is 11. This sample corresponds to the first case
in the sample input.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains two integers, W and H, separated by a blank space. Then,
there are H lines. Each line consists of W digits (between 1 and 9) indicating the number of petals of
the corresponding daisy.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output should contain the minimum number of movements of the corresponding
case.
