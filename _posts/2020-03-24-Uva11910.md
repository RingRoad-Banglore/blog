title: Uva 11910  Closest Fractions
---


## Input

```text
Every day we consider lots of real constants: e, ,


2, to name

but a few. These numbers may or may not be rational (i.e. repre-
sentable as a quotient of two integers), but it is always interesting
to give close fraction approximations to them with small denom-
inators and numerators. Arguably the most well-known result in
history is from Liu Hui and Zu Chongzhi in China millenniums
ago. The result   355/113 = 3.141592920 is correct to 7 signif-
icant figures, and has remained the most accurate approximation
available for the next 900 years.

You are asked to write a program that finds for any input
value the three closest fractions x/y, with 1  x, y  1000, and
x, y relatively prime (i.e. they have no positive common factors
other than 1, so the fraction is in simplest form).

## Output

```text
Each input file contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts on a new line.

Each case contains one number on a line, each with exactly ten digits.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input number, list the corresponding approximate fractions, ordered by ascending distance to
it, as shown in the sample output. You can assume that no ties will occur using our test data.

You are advised to pay attention to the required output format. In particular, all output real
numbers must have exactly ten digits.

## Sample Output

```text
3.141592654
66.66666666
333.3333333
