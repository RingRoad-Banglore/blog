title: Uva 10287  Gifts in a Hexagonal Box
---


## Input

```
When we buy gifts for someone, we also try to make sure that the box in which the gifts are placed
is also beautiful. So the gift box is a very important thing. I dont want to discuss more on this issue,
so now lets move our attention to the image below. This image shows how round gifts can be put
optimally in a regular hexagon shaped box (A regular hexagon is a hexagon whose all edges are equal
and all internal angles are also equal).

Given the length of one side of the hexagonal box, you will have to find the radius of the circular
gifts for all four cases. You can assume that the placement of the gifts is symmetric as they are shown
in the figure above. To be more precise

a) In the first case the gift touches all six sides of the box.

b) In the second case both the gifts touch two sides of the box.

c) In the third case all the gifts touch two different sides of the box.

d) In the fourth case two gifts touch two different sides of the box and other two touches one side.

e) The radiuses of all circular gifts are equal for every single case.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains a single non negative floating point
number S (S  10000), here S is the length of one side of the hexagonal box.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line should contain four floating point numbers
r1, r2, r3, r4 separated by a single space. Here r1 is the radius of the gift when only one gift is kept
inside the box; r2 is the radius of the gifts when only two gifts are placed inside the box. r3 and r4 has
similar meanings. The floating point numbers should have ten digits after the decimal point. Outputs
will be checked with special judge, so small precision errors will be ignored.

## Sample Output

```
0.0000001
0.0000002
0.0000003
