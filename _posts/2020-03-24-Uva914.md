```

Professor Ma.L. (Math Lover) loves everything related to prime
numbers. Remember that a prime is a positive number bigger
than one and only divisible by 1 and itself. He is now working on
a property of a set of primes called the jumping champion. An
integer N is called the jumping champion if it is the most
frequently occurring difference between consecutive primes.

For example, consider the consecutive primes 2 3 5 7 11.
The differences between primes are 1 2 2 4. Therefore, for this
set of primes, the jumping champion is exactly 2 (occurring two
times).

He would really like to know for any set of primes what is
their corresponding jumping champion. Could you help him?

Your task is to write a program that, given a lower and an upper bound, calculates the jumping
champion of all the primes numbers that are in the defined limits (the upper and lower bound are
considered themselves to be inside the limit).
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases that follow.
Each test case is given on a line with two integer numbers L and U (0  L  U  1000000),

separated by a single space, which represent the lower and upper limits (respectively) to consider.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of T lines, one for each case.
The i-th line contains:

 The jumping champion is NUM   if the jumping champion for the i-th case can be found
and it is NUM ;

 No jumping champion  if no single jumping champion can be found (if there are less than
two primes in the interval or if there is more than one difference occurring a maximum number
of times)

```

## Sample Input

```
3

2 11

2 5

30 50

```

## Sample Output

```

The jumping champion is 2

No jumping champion

The jumping champion is 4
