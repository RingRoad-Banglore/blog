title: Uva 12045  Fun with Strings
---


```
Zibon just started his courses in Computer science. After having some lectures on programming courses
he fell in love with strings. He started to play with strings and experiments on them. One day he started
a string of arbitrary (of course positive) length consisting of only {a, b}. He considered it as 1st string
and generated subsequent strings from it by replacing all the bs with ab and all the as with b. For
example, if he i-th string is abab, (i + 1)-th string will be b(ab)b(ab) = babbab. He found that the
N -th string has the length X and M -th string has the length Y . He wondered what will be length of
the K-th string. Can you help him?
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer T (T  1000) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

Five integers N , X, M , Y and K where (0 < N,X,M, Y,K < 109 and N = M).

```

## Output

```
For each test case produce one line of output giving either the number which is desired length (modulo
1000000007) or the string Impossible. You output Impossible if the given input is not possible.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
3 16 5 42 6
5 1 6 10 9

```

## Sample Output

```
68
Impossible
