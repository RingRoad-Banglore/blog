## Input

```text
A general network system can be described as an undirected graph. Each node on the graph is a server,
and the data lines connecting the servers are treated as an edge on the graph. The edge weight is
the length of the data line. The communication distance between the two servers is defined as the
shortest path length between their corresponding nodes. Now, consider a network system where the
graph structure is a tree. You are the administrator of the network system and are required to add a
data line of a given length to the system. Data lines can be connected to any two servers.

Your task is to find the minimum distance between two servers where the communication distance
is farthest in all legitimate scenarios (all ways of adding the data line).
```

## Output

```text
The input contains multiple sets of data. For each set of data, the first row of input contains two
positive integers N (0 < N  100000), where N is the number of servers and L is the length of the
newly added data line. This is followed by N  1 lines, each with three positive integers a, b, l, which
means there is a data line with length l connected to the servers a and b. The server number is indexed
from 1, . . ., N .

Both l, and L fit in 32 bit signed integer. The last input set is just 2 0s on one line (denoting end
of all inputs), and should be ignored (no output for this).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of data, output on one line the minimum distance between two servers where the commu-
nication distance is farthest in all legitimate scenarios.
