## Input

```

All through history, some people have been interested in the solutions of polynomial equations. As
everybody knows, in the Middle Ages wizards were all around. They claimed to be able to nd n
solutions to any (univariate) polynomial equation of degree n. Of course, they sometimes needed to
include some hocus-pocus like their magic number i, which they say is a solution to the equation
x2 + 1 = 0 (the second solution being i).

But there are a few equations, for which most ordinary wizards failed to give n distinct solutions.
Only the oldest and wisest wizards tried to be clever and bubbled something about multiplicity of roots
 but nobody can possibly understand such excuses for nding fewer than n distinct roots.

Given a polynomial of degree n, nd out if wizards can possibly nd n distinct roots (including the
magic ones using i), or if it is impossible - even for the wizards - to nd n distinct roots.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with the number of test cases t (1  t  100) in a single line. Each test case consists
of a single line that holds a series of integers (separated by single spaces). The rst integer is the
degree n (0  n  10) of the polynomial in question. It is followed by the n + 1 coefficients a0 . . . an
(30  ai  30, a0 = 0) to form the equation

n
i=0 aix

ni = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output Yes! on a single line (without the quotes) if the wizards have a chance
(provided they are as good as they claim) to nd n distinct roots. Print No! on a single line (again
without quotes) if there is no way any wizard can possibly nd n distinct roots.
