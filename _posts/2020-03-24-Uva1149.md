title: Uva 01149  Bin Packing
---


```
A set of n 1-dimensional items have to be packed in identical bins. All bins have exactly the same
length l and each item i has length li  l. We look for a minimal number of bins q such that

 each bin contains at most 2 items,

 each item is packed in one of the q bins,

 the sum of the lengths of the items packed in a bin does not exceed l.

You are requested, given the integer values n, l, l1, , ln, to compute the optimal number of bins q.
```

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first line of the input file contains the number of items n (1  n  105). The second line
contains one integer that corresponds to the bin length l  10000. We then have n lines containing one
integer value that represents the length of the items.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, your program has to write the minimal number of bins required to pack all items.

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

Note: The sample instance and an optimal solution is shown in the figure below. Items are numbered
from 1 to 10 according to the input order.
