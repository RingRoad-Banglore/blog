## Input

```text

Given n boxes with widths of w1, w2, . . . , wn and another big box with width W , find how many ways
the boxes can be put in the big box. The constrains are:

1) Of course the summation of widths of the placed boxes should not be greater than W .

2) The boxes should be placed one by one starting from left without leaving any empty spaces
between them. So, the end of the big box may contain empty spaces. But if there is any unplaced
box which can be fit in this space, the ordering should be considered invalid (See the explanation
for sample case 1).

3) Two orderings are considered different if in one ordering, one box is in i-th position, but in another
ordering, it isnt.

4) If two boxes have same widths, they should be considered same.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.
Each case starts two integers n (1  n  100) and W (1  W  1000). The next line contains n

space separated integers, denoting w1 w2 . . . wn (1  wi  W ).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number first and the result modulo 10007.

Notes: For the first case of the Sample Input, the orderings are

12

13

21

23

31

32

Only 1 or 2 or 3 is not solutions since we can still place another box.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2

3 5

1 2 3

5 10

1 2 2 4 5

```
