title: Uva 00430  Swamp County Supervisors
---


## Input

```text
The smell of rebellion is rising over Swamp County. The county is geographically split into various bogs,
each represented by a supervisor on the Board of Supervisors. Since the bogs have varying populations,
each supervisor has votes in proportion to the total population of the county, with a majority of the
total votes needed for an ordinance to pass. The smaller bogs feel that they have no say on the Board
because, in fact, the votes of the largest bogs completely determine the outcome of a vote. The smaller
bogs might as well have zero votes.

Your teams job is to write some software to aid in finding a fairer voting plan. The Board has agreed
to consider a charter amendment that would make the number of votes needed to pass an ordinance a
total other than that needed for a simple majority. Given the number of votes each bog holds, and the
number of votes necessary to win (which could be more or less than a majority of the total votes), your
program is to calculate the Banzhaf power index for each bog.

Given the set of all possible votes, the Banzhaf power index for a bog is the number of times it
could change the outcome of the vote on an ordinance from failure to passage.

## Output

```text
Input to your program consists of a series of lines of at most 80 characters. Each line consists of a series
of numbers separated from each other by at least one space. The first number in a line is the minimum
number of votes needed for passage of an ordinance. The rest of the numbers are the votes held by
each bog. (For example, in the first line of the sample input below, the number of votes needed to pass
an ordinance is 17. There are six bogs, with votes of 1, 7, 3, 12, 9, and 1 respectively.)

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case represented by an input line, your program is to print the power index of each bog.

Output for each case should appear on a separate line, starting in the first column, with each power
index separated from the others by single spaces. The order of the power indexes on each line must
correspond to the input order of the votes for each bog.

Swamp County will never be divided into more than 27 bogstheres a limit to the number of lunches
the lobbyists will buy.
