title: Uva 12940  Next Palindromic Numbers
---


## Input

```
Since the moment Mary learned about palindromic numbers, she has been completely obsessed with
them. Indeed, she wants to produce a catalog of these numbers as a personal project.

For those of you who do not know, a palindromic number is a natural number whose reading (by
avoiding leading zeroes) from left to right is the same one as the one from right to left. For instance,
1991 is a palindromic number, but 1492 is not. Note that the only palindromic number that ends with
digit 0 is precisely the number 0. Also, a number being palindromic depends on the numerical basis
used to denote such a number. Mary is interested only in decimal palindromic numbers, i.e., numbers
written in the usual decimal notation.

Of course, Marys project of building a complete catalog is impossible to deliver since palindromic
numbers are infinite. However, she would still be pleased if groups of consecutive palindromic numbers
can be produced. In this way, she will be closer in accomplishing the projects goal of a complete
printed catalog of palindromic numbers.

Mary has asked for your help. She would like to have a program that, given two positive integer
numbers n and d, outputs the first n palindromic numbers greater than d.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing two blank-separated
integers n and d (1  n  102, 1  d  1060). Numbers are given in decimal notation, without leading
zeroes.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output n lines with the first n palindromic numbers greater than d. Output such a
list in ascending order, with numbers in decimal notation and without leading zeroes.

```

## Sample Output

```
3 8
4 175
2 77
1 20003

```
