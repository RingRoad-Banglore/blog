title: Uva 01142  Fighting the Heat
---


```
Last summer was so hot that it was impossible to do anything but stay in the bathroom and solve
puzzles. These games were so boring that you decided to write programs to solve them. This gave you
a good reason to go back to the lab and benefit from its air conditioner.

Here is the game you decided to solve automatically. Take a grid with n rows and m columns, with
a letter in each cell. From the grids cells, one can read words horizontally, vertically or diagonally,
oriented forwards or backwards. You also have a list of words, and the goal is to highlight all occurrences
of these words on the grid. The letters in non-highlighted cells of the grid form a word (called the code
word) that can be read from top to bottom and left to right. The goal of the program is to find the
code word automatically.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases.

Each case begins with the two integers n and m on a line (0 < n,m  40), separated by a blank.
The second line contains the number k (0 < k  200) of words in the list. Then follow the k words,
one per line. Words do not have more than 22 letters. After these, follows the grid, that is to say n
rows filled with m uppercase letters.

```

## Output

```
For each case, write the code word on a line.

Note: The sample input data corresponds to the array:
B B A R E D
A C A L H F
R W O E I I
E R O S N N
D A R N D E
A L L Y G S

Looking for the word ALLY, we find it at the bottom:

B B A R E D
A C A L H F
R W O E I I
E R O S N N
D A R N D E
A L L Y G S

After highlighting it, we look now for BARE that appears twice:
B B A R E D
A C A L H F
R W O E I I
E R O S N N
D A R N D E
A L L Y G S

We then treat BARED that also appears twice:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1142  Fighting the Heat 2/2

B B A R E D
A C A L H F
R W O E I I
E R O S N N
D A R N D E
A L L Y G S

Proceeding until the end of the list, we are left with:

C A
E
S

A R

Thus, it results as sample output.
