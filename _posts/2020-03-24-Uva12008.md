title: Uva 12008  Emotional Bishop
---


## Input

```

Bishop can move to any
square diagonally inside

the board

A bishop is a piece in the board game of chess. It is only allowed to
move diagonally. But it has no restriction on the distance for each
move. We can denote a position of a bishop by (r, c) if it is in r-th
row and c-th column. So formally we can say that, A bishop can go
from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2) if and only if |r1  r2| = |c1  c2|, i.e. absolute
difference of rows and absolute difference of columns are equal. And
also a bishop cannot move outside the board. See the following pictures
to make things clear, where the by X sign the valid moves of the bishop
are shown.

There was a bishop which is very emotional that it didnt like fight-
ing. So it didnt involve itself into any chess game. As no other bishop
is like it, it has to live alone in a board. So it created its own boards. It
doesnt want to restrict itself in a 8 8 chessboard. So it created many
two dimensional boards of different sizes. It had a board of size 100100
(i.e. 100 rows and 100 columns), another board of size 10002000 (i.e.
1000 rows and 2000 columns, you see it even didnt restrict itself on row-column equality).

Everything was going perfect for that emotional bishop until the day when it discovered that it
needs to move to a new cell. Since the bishop is too emotional he wants to go to the destination in
fewest moves. In this problem, you have to calculate the minimum number of moves required for the
emotional bishop to reach the destination. If the destination is impossible to reach, you have to say
impossible.

## Output

```
The input starts with an integer T (1  T  10000), the number of test cases. Each of the next T
lines will describe one test case by six integers R (1  R  1000000000), C (1  C  1000000000), SR
(1  SR  R), SC (1  SC  C), DR (1  DR  R) and DC (1  DC  C). Here R is the number
of rows in the board, C is the number of columns in the board, (SR, SC) is the initial square of the
bishop, (DR,DC) is the target location of the bishop. Initial location, target location are distinct.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output a single line in the format Case K: N , where K is the case number and
N is the minimum number of moves to reach the destination if it is possible to reach the destination
and impossible (quotes for clarity) otherwise. See sample output for exact format.
