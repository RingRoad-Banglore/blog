title: Uva 12757  Gothams Rail Track
---


## Input

```

Gothams railway track is made using rail blocks connected using joint bars. A rail block is made using
two parallel rail and perpendicularly laid sleepers. In rail tracks a rail block can be connected to at
most two other rail blocks. Several rail blocks are connected using joint bars to create a rail track.

In this problem you are going to work with N rail blocks numbered from 1 to N and will be given
following three types of queries:

1 u v  connect block u and v (1  u, v  N and u = v) (any moment a block will be connected
to at most two blocks).

2 u v  disconnect block u and v (it is ensured that this query will only disconnect existing
connections). Two blocks u and v is considered connected if and only if there was a 1 u v or 1
v u query performed and no 2 u v or 2 v u query is performed after that.

3 u v  output the longest distance between u and v, distance between two blocks is equal to
number of rail blocks in a path from u to v (including u, v). If there is no path then output -1.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T (T  5) denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case
contains two integers N (2  N  105) and Q (1  Q  105). The next Q lines contain queries as
described above.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case print the case number in the first line. Then for each query 3 u v print the answer in
separate line. See sample input output for more details.
