## Input

```

There were n cities in an ancient kingdom. In the beginning of the kingdom, all cities were isolated.
Kings ordered their subjects to construct roads connecting cities. A lot of roads were built with time.
Every road was always constructed along the line segment between two cities. All cities are partitioned
into disjoint components of cities by road-connectivity. A connected component of cities was called a
state. A state consists of cities and roads connecting them.

A historical record tells a time sequence of road constructions in order. A road connecting two cities
A and B doesnt intersect with other roads at a point except for A and B. Before construction, A and
B may have belonged to the same state or different states. After construction, A and B would belong
to a same state, i.e., two states would merge into a state if needed.

Prof. Kim, a historian, is concerned about the following ques-
tion: How many states does a horizontal line (corresponding to
the latitude of a specific place) pass by at a moment of the past?
The figure on the right shows an example of a configuration of
roads at some moment. A circle represents a city and a line seg-
ment represents a road between two cities. There are 3 states. A
line with y = 4.5 passes by two states with total 8 cities and a
line with y = 6.5 passes by one state with 5 cities.

You are to write a program which handles the following two
types of commands:

 road A B

A road between two cities A and B will be constructed. The road doesnt intersect with other
roads at a point except for A and B. This is an informative command and your program does
not need to respond.

 line C

This is a query. The program should output the number of states which a line y = C passes by
and the total number of cities of them.
```

## Output

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. The first line of each test case contains an integer n, the
number of cities, where 1  n  100, 000. Each of the following n lines contains two integers x and y
(0  x, y  1, 000, 000), where (x, y) represents the coordinate of a city. There is a single space between
the integers. The cities are numbered from 0 to n  1 in order. The next line contains an integer m,
the number of commands, where 1  m  200, 000. Each of the following m lines contains a command,
either road A B or line C, where 0  A = B < n and C (0 < C < 1, 000, 000) is a real number of
which the fractional part is always 0.5. There exists at most one road construction connecting a pair
of cities and there exists at least one query per a test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for a query through all test cases.
The line should contain two integers which represent the number of states and the total number of
cities of them respectively.
