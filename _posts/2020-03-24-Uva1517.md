## Input

```

Jeroen operates a warehouse storage facility for the North Western Electrical Resource Company
(NWERC). When a customer places an order with NWERC, this order is conveyed to the warehouse.
Jeroens task is to then find the products ordered, pack them into a box, and ship them to the customer.

NWERC has an unusual warehouse policy: the products are not arranged in any particular order,
and are strewn all over the place. However, it is possible for Jeroen to do his job because each product
is tracked using RFID technology (Objects, that have a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag
attached, can be tracked using radio waves). Specifically, each product is assigned a wireless RFID
chip as soon as it enters the warehouse, and sensors located on the warehouse ceiling are used to
automatically track the products.

By default, each sensor has a range of r units  that is, it can read any RFID chip that is located
at most r units from it in a straight line. However, if the line segment between a sensor and a product
intersects with or touches x walls, the range of the sensor is reduced by x units in that direction.
Furthermore, the sensors may fail to read an RFID chip due to interference from other sensors, so the
distance between any pair of sensors in the warehouse is guaranteed to be at least r units. You may
further assume that no sensor or product is placed on a wall.

Jeroen now wants to determine, for each product, which sensors can read its RFID chip. Can you
help him?

## Output

```
On the first line one positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:

 one line with four integers s (1  s  250000), r (1  r  20), w (0  w  10) and p
(1  p  10000) where s represents the number of sensors, r the range of each sensor, w the
number of walls and p the number of products.

 s lines containing two integers xi and yi (10000  xi, yi  10000). Each such line represents a
sensor at location (xi, yi). The distance between any pair of sensors is guaranteed to be at least
r units.

 w lines containing four integers bxi, byi , exi and eyi (10000  bxi, byi, exi, eyi  10000). Each
such line represents a wall, which should be considered as straight line segment from (bxi, byi) to
(exi, eyi). The length of this line segment will be positive.

 p lines, each containing two integers pxi and pyi (10000  pxi, pyi  10000). Each such line
represents a product at location (pxi, pyi).

```

## Sample Input

```
Per test case:

 p lines, each representing a product in the order they appear in the input. Each line should
contain an integer t, the number of sensors that can track the product; this integer should then be
followed by a list of t ordered pairs representing the corresponding sensor locations. If there are
multiple sensors, they should be sorted in increasing order by x-coordinate. If multiple sensors
have the same x-coordinate, they should be sorted in increasing order by y-coordinate.
