```

Josephina is a clever girl and addicted to Machine Learning recently. She pays much attention to a
method called Linear Discriminant Analysis, which has many interesting properties.

In order to test the algorithms efficiency, she collects many datasets. Whats more, each data is
divided into two parts: training data and test data. She gets the parameters of the model on training
data and test the model on test data.

To her surprise, she finds each datasets test error curve is just a parabolic curve. A parabolic curve
corresponds to a quadratic function. In mathematics, a quadratic function is a polynomial function of
the form f(x) = ax2 + bx+ c. The quadratic will degrade to linear function if a = 0.

Its very easy to calculate the minimal error if there is only one test error curve. However, there
are several datasets, which means Josephina will obtain many parabolic curves. Josephina wants to
get the tuned parameters that make the best performance on all datasets. So she should take all error
curves into account, i.e., she has to deal with many quadric functions and make a new error definition
to represent the total error. Now, she focuses on the following new functions minimal which related to
multiple quadric functions.

The new function F (x) is defined as follow:

F (x) = max(Si(x)), i = 1 . . . n. The domain of x is [0, 1000]. Si(x) is a quadric function.

Josephina wonders the minimum of F (x). Unfortunately, its too hard for her to solve this problem.
As a super programmer, can you help her?

## Input

```
The input contains multiple test cases. The first line is the number of cases T (T < 100). Each case
begins with a number n (n  10000). Following n lines, each line contains three integers a (0  a  100),
b (|b|  5000), c (|c|  5000), which mean the corresponding coefficients of a quadratic function.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the answer in a line. Round to 4 digits after the decimal point.
