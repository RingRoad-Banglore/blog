## Input

```text
Given N and K, find the lexicographically K-th (1-indexed) smallest permutation P1, P2, . . ., PN
of the first N positive integers (1, 2, . . . , N), such that the adjacent numbers are relatively prime
[gcd(Pi, Pi+1) = 1, for 1  i < N ] in the permutation. A permutation of N numbers A1, A2, . . .,
AN is lexicographically smaller than another permutation B1, B2, . . ., BN if Ai < Bi for some i and
Aj = Bj for all j < i.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input contains an integer T ( 20), which is the number of test cases. Each of the next
T lines contain two space separated integers N (1  N  28) and K (1  K  1018).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output the case number and then N space separated integers which is the lexicograph-
ically K-th smallest permutation of the first N positive integer numbers, such that adjacent numbers
in the permutation are relatively prime. If there are less than K such permutations then output -1.

See sample input output for exact formatting.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
3 3
4 2
4 20

```
