title: Uva 12963  Astragalus Nitidiflorus
---


## Input

```
For about 100 years, astragalus nitidiflorus, also known as the garbancillo of Tallante, was thought to
be an extinct plant species. However in 2004 it was rediscovered in a small hamlet of Cartagena called
Tallante. This fact caused a great joy among biologists, botanists and local people, who celebrated the
discovery with a party and a famous youtube video dedicated to the astragalus nitidiflorus.

Astragalus What is an astragalus nitififlorus?
What does it have?

In this problem, you have to help biolo-
gists look for the plants of astragalus nitid-
iflorus. They have made a map of all the
possible locations of this elusive plant species.
The map takes the form of a matrix of char-
acters. The plants can be located in the inter-
sections of one vertical occurrence of the word
ASTRAGALUS and one horizontal occurrence of
the word GARBANCILLOS.

For example, in the following map there is
one possible location of the plant at the 6th row
and 6th column:
..............
.....A........
.....S........
.....T........
.....R........
.GARBANCILLOS.
.....G........
.....A........
.....L........
.....U........
.....S........

We have used . in order to improve visualization, but it could be replaced by any character. The
occurrences of GARBANCILLOS are always from left to right, and ASTRAGALUS from up to down.

Each occurrence of ASTRAGALUS or GARBANCILLOS can only be used once at most. So, for example,
in the following map there are four intersections but only one possible location of the plant:
.................
....GARBANCILLOS.
.....S...........
.....T...........
.....R...........
.GARBANCILLOS....
.....GARBANCILLOS
.GARBANCILLOS....
.....L...........
.....U...........
.....S...........

Write a program that, given a map, computes the maximum number of possible locations of astra-
galus nitidiflorus.

```

## Output

```
The input consists of a series of test cases. The first line contains a number that indicates the number
of test cases.

Each case begins with two numbers, R, C, indicating the number of rows and columns of the map,
respectively. Both numbers will be between 1 and 150. Then, there are R lines each with C characters,
representing the map.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, you have to output the maximum possible locations of the plant; that is, the
maximum number of intersections of a vertical ASTRAGALUS and a horizontal GARBANCILLOS, where
these occurrences cannot be used more than once.
