```
Given a four-digit integer n, your task is to count the number of ways to make it a square number by
changing exactly one digit (note that you cant change the first digit to 0). For example, if n = 7844,
there are two ways: 3844 = 622 and 7744 = 882.
```

## Input

```
The first line of integer contains one integer T (1  T  1000), the number of test cases. Each test
case contains a single integer n (1000  n  9999).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the number of ways to make it a square integer by
changing exactly one digit.

```

## Sample Input

```
2
7844
9121

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 2
Case 2: 0
```
