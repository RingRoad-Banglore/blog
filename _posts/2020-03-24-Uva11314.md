## Input

```text
You have been given the task of cutting out a quadrilateral slice of
cake out of a larger, rectangular cake. You must find the slice with
the smallest perimeter that satisfies the following constraints. If
the cake is of size 10000-by-10000 units and is represented us-
ing the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane, then your slice is
quadrilateral ABCD (see figure). Points A and B are fixed and
will be given to you. Also, A,B will lie on a negatively sloping line.
Furthermore, points C and D must lie on the positive y-axis and
positive x-axis respectively, but it is up to you to determine where
these two points should be. A,B,C,D will be distinct points.

Output the minimum perimeter of your slice of cake.
```

## Output

```text
On the first line you will be given n (1  n  100), the number of test cases. The following n lines each
contain ax ay bx by (0 < ax, ay, bx, by  10000.0), the coordinates of points A and B respectively.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the perimeter accurate to 3 decimal places on its own line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1
3.0 1.0 1.0 2.0

```
