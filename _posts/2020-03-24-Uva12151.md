title: Uva 12151  Higgs Boson

## Input

```text
Its been 100 years since the detection of the first Higgs boson and now particle physics is a mainstream
subject in all high schools. Obviously, kids love the fact that they can create tiny black holes using only
their portable particle accelerators and show off to their friends and colleagues. Although the creation
of big black holes that could swallow the whole planet is possible even with these portable particle
accelerators, the devices are programmed to only thrown particles when this undesirable side effect is
impossible.

Your granddaughter is trying to create her own black holes with a portable accelerator kit, which is
composed of two small particle accelerators that throw, each one, a boson-sized particle. Both particles
are thrown at the same time, and a black hole appears when the particles collide. However, your
granddaughter doesnt know how much time shell have to wait before this happens. Fortunately, each
accelerator can predict the particles trajectory, showing four integer values into its display, called A,
B, C and D. Each value can be replaced into the following equations:

r = At+B
 = Ct+D

in order to determine the trajectory of the particle, in polar coordinates. The radius (r) is represented
in distance units and the angle () in degrees. The time (t) is given in time units and it is always a
rational value which can be represented by an irreducible fraction. Your granddaughter knows that in
polar coordinates a point has infinite representations. In general, the point (r, ) can be represented as
(r,   k  360o) or (r,   (2k + 1) 180o), where k is any integer. Besides, the origin (r = 0) can
be represented as (0, ) for any .

Using these parameters informed by each particle accelerator, your granddaughter wants to deter-
mine whether the particles will eventually collide and, if they do, the time when they will collide. After
the first collision it is impossible to predict the particles trajectory, therefore, only the first possible
collision should be considered.

Although your granddaughter is really intelligent and has a deep knowledge of particle physics,
she does not know how to program computers and is looking for some notes in her grandfathers (or
grandmothers) ICPC notebook (dont forget, she is your granddaughter!). Fortunately for you, there
is a note on your notebook which says that you wrote that code during the 2008 ICPC South America
Regional Contest (or, to be more specific, this contest).

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases, one per line. Each test case contains eight integer numbers
separated by single spaces, A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, B2, C2, D2(104  A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, B2, C2, D2  104).
The first four input values (A1, B1, C1, D1) correspond to the four parameters displayed by the first
portable particle accelerator and the following input values (A2, B2, C2, D2) correspond to the four
parameters displayed by the second portable particle accelerator when both particles are thrown. The
end of the input is represented by A1 = B1 = C1 = D1 = A2 = B2 = C2 = D2 = 0, which should not
be processed as a test case, since these are the values displayed by the particle accelerators when a big
black hole would be created if the particles were trown. Although the end of input is represented by a
line with eight zeroes, note that the number zero is a possible input value.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, your program must output a line containing two non-negative integers ta and tb
separated by a single space. If there is no possibility of collision, ta = tb = 0, otherwise, ta/tb must be
an irreducible fraction representing the earliest collision time. Even if the fraction results in an integer
value, you still must output the number 1 as the denominator (see samples below).
