title: Uva 12062  Reverse Assignment
---


## Input

```text
Alex has a simple assignment in his hand: counting the number of divisors of a given positive number
M . For example the number 60 has 12 divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 and 60. Although
it is very easy task, finding the reverse is not that easy. If you are given the number of divisors D of
an unknown positive number M , it is not very easy to find M and in all cases there are more than one
solution. The boring and easy assignments given by his teachers do not keep intelligent Alex interested
for long. So he is trying to solve this rather difficult task now. Can you help him?
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains an integer D (0 < D  5000). Input
is terminated by a line, which contains a number 0. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input except the last one you should produce one line of output. This line should
contain the serial number of output followed by a positive number M less than (1015+1) whose number
of divisors is exactly D. If there is no such number M less than (1015 + 1) whose total number of
divisors is D, print the word Impossible without the quotes. If there is more than one possible value
of M within the specified range, print the smallest one. Look at the output for sample input for details.
