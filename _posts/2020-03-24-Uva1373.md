## Input

```

One of the questions children often ask is How many stars are there in the sky? Under ideal conditions,
even with the naked eye, nearly eight thousands are observable in the northern hemisphere. With a
decent telescope, you may find many more, but, as the sight field will be limited, you may find much
less at a time.

Children may ask the same questions to their parents on a planet of some solar system billions of
light-years away from the Earth. Their telescopes are similar to ours with circular sight fields, but alien
kids have many eyes and can look into different directions at a time through many telescopes.

Given a set of positions of stars, a set of telescopes and the directions they are looking to, your task
is to count up how many stars can be seen through these telescopes.

## Output

```
The input consists of one or more datasets. The number of datasets is less than 50. Each dataset
describes stars and the parameters of the telescopes used.

The first line of a dataset contains a positive integer n not exceeding 500, meaning the number of
stars. Each of the n lines following it contains three decimal fractions, sx, sy, and sz. They give the
position (sx, sy, sz) of the star described in Euclidean coordinates. You may assume 1000  sx  1000,
1000  sy  1000, 1000  sz  1000 and (sx, sy, sz) = (0, 0, 0).

Then comes a line containing a positive integer m not exceeding 50, meaning the number of tele-
scopes. Each of the following m lines contains four decimal fractions, tx, ty, tz, and , describing a
telescope.

The first three numbers represent the di-
rection of the telescope. All the telescopes are
at the origin of the coordinate system (0, 0, 0)
(we ignore the size of the planet). The three
numbers give the point (tx, ty, tz) which can be
seen in the center of the sight through the tele-
scope. You may assume 1000  tx  1000,
1000  ty  1000, 1000  tz  1000 and
(tx, ty, tz) = (0, 0, 0).

The fourth number  (0    /2) gives
the angular radius, in radians, of the sight field
of the telescope.

Let us define that i,j is the angle between
the direction of the i-th star and the center di-
rection of the j-th telescope and j is the angu-
lar radius of the sight field of the j-th telescope.
The i-th star is observable through the j-th telescope if and only if i,j is less than j . You may assume
that |i,j  j | > 0.00000001 for all pairs of i and j.

The end of the input is indicated with a line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each dataset, one line containing an integer meaning the number of stars observable through the
telescopes should be output. No other characters should be contained in the output. Note that stars
that can be seen through more than one telescope should not be counted twice or more.
