title: Uva 12570  Qualle Quale
---


## Input

```
If you speak German, you should know the first word in the title. If you speak Italian, you should know
the second one :)

Why I use these two words? Because I dont have better choices :( I want my problems titles to
start with A, B, C, etc. This is problem Q so it has to begin with the letter Q.

Sometimes its difficult. Each problem title has to tell people something about the problem itself,
so it cant be arbitrary. If I cant find a suitable title in English, I have to try other languages like
Chinese (for example, see the last three problems in Rujia Lius Present 5 ^_^).

Here is an example.

No English French Chinese
1 A B C
2 D - B
3 C B -
4 E - E
5 C A -

The title of problem 1 in English starts with A, and the French version starts with B. The Chinese
title of problem 1 starts with C. A hyphen means N/A, so problem 2 doesnt have a French version.

One possible combination is (note that each problem should be used exactly once):

Problem A Problem 1 in English
Problem B Problem 3 in French
Problem C Problem 5 in English
Problem D Problem 2 in English
Problem E Problem 4 in Chinese

Could you tell me all the possible language combinations? For each combination, all the languages
in it must be used (i.e. You cant say the combination is English,Chinese if none of the problems
actually used the Chinese version).

## Output

```
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T  500). Each test case begins with two integers
n, m (3  n  26, 1  m  5), the number of problems and the number of languages. The next n lines
contains the table containing the first m upper-case letters or -. The j-th column in the i-th row in
the table is the first letter of the title in the j-th language. A special character - means that version
does not exist.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print all possible combinations in a single line. Each combination is a string of
languages used (languages are labeled 1 to m) in increasing order. Shorter combinations should come
first. Combinations of the same length should be sorted in increasing order. If the problemset cannot
be made, print -1.
