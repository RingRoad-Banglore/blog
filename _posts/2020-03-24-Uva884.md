title: Uva 00884  Factorial Factors
---


## Input

```
The factorial function, n! = 1  2  . . .  n, has many interesting properties. In this problem, we want
to determine the maximum number of integer terms (excluding 1) that can be used to express n!. For
example:

8! = 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 = 2  3  2  2  5  3  2  7  2  2  2 = 27  32  5  7

By inspection, it is clear that the maximum number of terms (excluding 1) that can be multiplied
together to produce 8! is 11.
```

## Output

```
The input for your program consists of a series of test cases on separate lines, ended by end-of-file.
Each line contains one number, n, 2  n  1000000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the maximum number of factors (excluding 1) that can be multiplied together
to produce n!. Put the output from each test case on a separate line, starting in the first column.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
1000000
1996
5
8
123456
