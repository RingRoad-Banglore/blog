We want to reconstruct a surface from a two polygons.

Think of it as if we sliced a volume (e.g. a CAT
scan (p svenska ungefr skiktrntgen)) at two z-
coordinates, converted these two planar contours into
polygons, and we would now like to rebuild a surface
of the body between the polygonal cuts from these
polygons. In this problem, the resulting surface con-
sists of triangles only. In the figure to the right,
the objective is to stitch the square with the tri-
angle. Notice that vertices of the tile triangles which
combines these two contour polygons is vertices of
the contour polygons, with the vertices of each tile
taken two from one polygon and one from the other.

Now suppose we have decided
to form a triangle using P1, Q1, Q2,
shown in the upper left picture. If
the vertices of the contour are in
counterclockwise order and we are
forming triangles in counterclock-
wise order, we now have two op-
tions. Since the surface built must
be without holes, P1 and Q2 must
be part of the next triangle. This
leaves us with either taking the the
next P-vertex, shown in the left
bottom figure, or taking the next
Q-vertex, shown in the right bot-
tom figure.

Since each triangle uses one new
vertex from the contour polygons,
the resulting surface will consist of
7 (4+3) triangles.

We would like to know the min-
imum possible area of such a sur-
face. One way of solving this
problem is to form a matrix. Sup-
pose the number of vertices of the
polygons are m and n. Then build

a matrix with m rows and n columns. The position in the matrix corresponds to the two vertices that
the next, new, triangle has in common with the last one. A movement to the right means that we
are constructing a new triangle using a new vertex from the second polygon (Q), while a movement
downwards means a new triangle using a vertex from the first polygon (P). The movement wraps at

the rightmost column and the downmost row. In the example, we started with the points P1 and Q1,
and used the point Q2 to from a triangle.

Then we could either pick P2 as our next point, a downward move-
ment, or pick Q3 as our next point, a rightward movement. Of course, the
path must end up at the starting position. For each movement, a cost is
associated, namely the area of the triangle.

So, the optimization problem can be restated as the problem of finding
a closed path with the minimum sum of the costs in the matrix grid, where
each horizontal line on the grid is crossed exactly once by the path, and
where each vertical line on the grid is crossed exactly once by the path, as
in the figure to the right.

Hint. One simple formula to calculate the area of a triangle is Herons
formula: 

p  (p a)  (p b)  (p c),

where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides, and p is the semiperimeter
(a+ b+ c)/2.

## Input

```
The input starts with a single number on a line, N , which stands for the
number of test cases. Following this line are the N test cases. Each test
case starts with three numbers m, n, z1. m and n are integers, greater than
2 but less than or equal to 20. m stands for the number of points in the first
polygon and n stands for the number of points in the second polygon. z1 is
a real positive number which stands for the z-coordinates for the vertices in
the second polygon. The z-coordinates for the vertices in the first polygon
is zero. Following this line are m + n lines with x- and y-coordinates of
the simple, not necessarily convex, polygons in counterclockwise order.
All coordinates are real numbers. First are the coordinates for the first
polygon, followed by the coordinates for the second polygon.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the minimum area of the surface connecting the both polygons, using five
decimal digits. However, trailing zeros may be omitted. The output is a real number. A relative error
of up to 0.01% is allowed.
