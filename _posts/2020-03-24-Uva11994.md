## Input

```
There is a forest of colorful rooted trees containing n nodes. You are given m operations. Execute them
one by one, and output the results.

1 x y c Change xs father to y. If x = y or x is a ancestor of y, simply ignore
it. The edge between x and its old father is removed, and the new
edge should be painted with color c.

2 x y c Paint all the edges along the path xy with color c. If there is no
path between x and y, simply ignore it.

3 x y Count the number of edges along the path xy, and the total number
of colors among these edges.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m
(1  n  50, 000, 1  m  200, 000). Nodes are numbered from 1 to n. The second line contains n
integers F [i] (0  F [i]  n), the father of each node (F [i] = 0 means the node is the root of a tree).
The next line contains n integers C[i] (1  C[i]  30), the colors of the edges between each node and
its father (for root nodes, the corresponding color should be ignored). Each of the next m lines contains
an operation. For all operations, 1  x, y  n, for each type-2 operation, 1  c  30. The input is
terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each type-3 operation, output two integers: the number of edges and the number of colors among
these edges.
