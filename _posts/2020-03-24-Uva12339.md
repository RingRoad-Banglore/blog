```
Arithmancy is one of the most favorite subjects of Hermione Granger, the most intelligent witch of her
generation. She was thinking about the last homework given by Professor Vector:

A peculiar magical creature can live in a rectangle drawn into a n n square grid if and only if the
rectangle is not a square and its sides are parallel to the major axes. Same conditions hold for higher
dimensions (yes, the peculiar creature can even be 2500-dimensional!!!), i.e. if the sides parallel to the
major axes are all equal, it cannot live inside the hyper box. For example, in a 3-dimensional grid, it
can live inside a 223 or a 345 box, but it cannot live inside a 555cube!! In how many ways
one can draw a k-dimensional hyper box inside a n n . . . n (k times n) grid so that the peculiar
creature can live inside the hyper box? A way is different from another way if at least one co-ordinate
of one corner is different. For example, in a 4  4 grid, {(0,0), (0,3), (2,3), (2,0)}, {(1,0), (1,3), (3,3),
(3,0)} and {(0,0), (0,3), (4,3), (4,0)} are 3 different ways but {(0,0), (0,3), (2,3), (2,0)}, {(0,3), (2,3),
(2,0), (0,0)} and {(2,3), (2,0), (0,0), (0,3)} are not different.

Hermione is quite confident of solving it, but she has to go now to the Room of Requirement with
Harry and Ron for a secret meeting. Your task is to write a program that solves the problem for
Hermione.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains a single integer T (T  5, 000) which denotes the number of test cases. Each of
the following T lines contains two integers, n (1  n  109) and k (2  k  2500).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a single integer in each line which is the number of ways to draw k-dimensional
axis-parallel hyper boxes in an n  n  . . .  n grid. As this number can be quite large, output the
answer mod 1, 000, 000, 007 (109 + 7).
