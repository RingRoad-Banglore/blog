title: Uva 11063  B2Sequence
---


## Input

```
A B2-Sequence is a sequence of positive integers 1  b1 < b2 < b3 . . . such that all pairwise sums bi+ bj ,
where i  j, are different.

Your task is to determine if a given sequence is a B2-Sequence or not.
```

## Output

```
Each test case starts with 2  N  100, the number of elements in a sequence. Next line will have N
integers, representing the value of each element in the sequence. Each element bi is an integer such that
bi  10000. There is a blank line after each test case. The input is terminated by end of file (EOF).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case you must print the number of the test case, starting from 1, and a message indicating
if the corresponding sequence it is a B2-Sequence or not. See the sample output below. After each test
case you must print a blank line.

```

## Sample Output

```

1 2 4 8

4
3 7 10 14
