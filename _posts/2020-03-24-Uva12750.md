title: Uva 12750  Keep Rafa at Chelsea
---


```

The eccentric owner of Chelsea Football Club Mr. Billionaire has sacked his Manager once again and
appointed only the 10th manager in his prolonged 9 years reign at the club. And to the delight of the
rival Manchester United fans, its none other than the great entertainer named Rafa Benitez! (If you
follow EPL, you must know what I mean. If you dont, you can still solve the problem but you are
missing the next best thing after Monty Python and Mr. Bean.) Rafa, obviously with his unquestionable
talent as a football manager, has immediately lead his team to a nosedive in performance and the poor
United fans are worried that dear Mr. Billionaire might put an end to all the fun and sack Rafa sooner
than any rival fan can hope for. So they decide to start an extensive Keep Rafa at Chelsea campaign.
And you are the score keeper of the campaign.

You are given a series of match results for Chelsea denoted by W (win), L (Lose) or D (Draw). If
Chelsea do not win a game for 3 consecutive matches, Rafa will be sacked instantly and start playing this
game (www.mousebreaker.com/games/romanswrath/playgame). Your job is to figure out how many
games will dear Rafa last at Chelsea.
