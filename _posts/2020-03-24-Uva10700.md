title: Uva 10700  Camel trading
---


```
Aroud 800 A.D., El Mamum, Calif of Baghdad was presented the formula 1 + 2  3  4 + 5, which had
its origin in the financial accounts of a camel transaction. The formula lacked parenthesis and was
ambiguous. So, he decided to ask savants to provide him with a method to find which interpretation is
the most advantageous for him, depending on whether is is buying or selling the camels.

You are commissioned by El Mamum to write a program that determines the maximum and mini-
mum possible interpretation of a parenthesis-less expression.
