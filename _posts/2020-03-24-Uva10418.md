title: Uva 10418  Hyper Toy Soldiers
---


```
Alans father has bought him a box of toy soldiers, k red soldiers, k green soldiers, and one gold soldier.
There is a m  n board, each square has a height hi,j , and all squares are big enough to hold all the
soldiers. At first, each soldier is placed in a square (not neccesarily all different), and t goal squares are
chosen, each assigned with an importance value ri. The goal is to move soldiers on these t squares so
that the i-th square has exactly ri soldier(s) on it. Each soldier has to be on one of the t squares, so
its guaranteed that the sum of all ri is equal to 2k + 1.

Each time, a soldier can move to an adjacent (north, south, east or west) square, but it cant move
outside the board. Red soldiers can only climb up, so it can move only if the target square is not lower
than the current square; Green soldiers can only jump down, so it can move only if the target square is
not higher than the current square; The gold soldier can move freely on the board.

Since it may be impossible to achieve the goal, Alan is allowed to use a kind of magic. Every time
he uses the magic, he can do a permutation of all the soldiers (that is, he can do an arbitary number of
exchanges, but he cannot move any soldier).

Help Alan to use least possible number of magic to achieve the goal.

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1  t  10). Each test case begins with
a line containing 4 integers m,n, k, t (2  m,n  100, 1  k  50, 1  t  2k + 1). The second line
contains 2k + 1 pairs (xi, yi) indicating the initial positions of the soldiers. The first k pairs describe
red soldiers, the following k describe the green soldiers, and the last one describe the gold soldier. The
third line contains t triples (xi, yi, ri) indicating the positions and importance value of the goal squares.
The following m lines each contains n integers, indicating the heights of squares. The i-th integer of
the j-th line is the height of square (xi, yj). Heights are integers between 0 and 100.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print on a single line the least number of magic needed.
