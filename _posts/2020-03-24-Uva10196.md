title: Uva 10196  Check The Check
---


## Input

```text
Your task is to write a program that reads a chess board configuration and answers if theres a king
under attack (i.e. in check). A king is in check if its in a square which is attacked by an oponnets
piece (i.e. its in square which can be taken by an oponnets piece in his next move).

White pieces will be represented by uppercase letters whereas black pieces will be represented by
lowercase letters. White side will always be on the bottom of the board and black side will always be
on the top of the board.

For those unfamiliar with chess, here are the movements of each piece:

Pawn (p or P): can only move straight ahead, one square at a time. But it takes pieces diagonally
(and thats what concerns to you in this problem).

Knight (n or N) : have a special movement and its the only piece that can jump over other pieces.
The knight movement can be viewed as an L. See the example bellow.

Bishop (b or B) : can move any number of squares diagonally (forward or backward).

Rook (r or R) : can move any number of squares vertically or horizontally (forward or backward).

Queen (q or Q) : can move any number of squares in any direction (diagonally, horizontally or verti-
cally, forward or backward).

King (k or K) : can move one square at a time, in any direction (diagonally, horizontally or vertically,
forward or backward).

Movements examples (* indicates where the piece can take another pieces):

........ ...*.... *.....*. *..*..*. ........ ........

Remember that the knight is the only piece that can jumper over other pieces. The pawn movement
will depend on its side. If its a black pawn, it can only move one square diagonally down the board. If
its a white pawn, it can only move one square diagonally up the board. The example above is a black
pawn as its a lowercase p (we say move meaning the squares where the pawn can move to when it
takes another piece).
```

## Output

```text
There will be an arbitrary number of board configurations on the input. Each board will consist of
8 lines of 8 characters each. A . character will represent an empty square. Upper and lower case
letters (as defined above) will represent the pieces. There will be no invalid characters (i.e. pieces) and
there wont be a configuration where both kings are in check. You must read until you find an empty

board (i.e. a board that is formed only of . characters) which should not be processed. There will
be an empty line between each pair of board configurations. In all boards (except the last one which is
empty) will appear both the white king and the black king (one, and only one of each).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each board configuration read you must output one of the following answers:

Game #d: white king is in check.
Game #d: black king is in check.
Game #d: no king is in check.

Where d stands for the game number (starting from 1).
