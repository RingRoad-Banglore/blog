title: Uva 13105  Alliances in Hogwarts
---


## Input

```
These are hard times for Dumbledores followers in Hogwarts. The Ministry of Magic is interfering at
Hogwarts, and assigned Dolores Umbridge for this work. Some students oppose the the Ministrys rules
and have established alliances as the Dumbledores Army. Professor Umbridge wants to dissolve this
alliances and punish all who break the rules and defy the Ministry, thats why she assigned to Draco and
the Inquisitorial Squad a very special mission: determine which students belongs to the Dumbledore
Army.

To achieve this mission the Inquisitorial Squad must observe the behaviour of the students and
determine if they are allies (support the Ministry) or enemies (belong to the Dumbledores Army). The
Inquisitorial Squad can mark the relation between two students as friendship or enmity, according to
their behaviour and following the next rules:

 Two students are allies if their loyalties are the same.

 Two students are enemies if they have different loyalties.

 A student is by definition ally of himself.

 Nobody is an enemy of himself.

 Both relations of friendship or enmity are mutual.

 Friends of my friends are my friends too. If the student x is ally of student y and student y is
ally with student z, then x is ally with z too.

 The enemy of my enemy is my friend. If x is a enemy of z and z is an enemy of y, then x is a
friend of y.

 The enemy of a friend is my enemy too. If x is a friend of y and y is an enemy of z, then z is
an enemy of x too.

Professor Umbridge is not so patient, so she will be asking questions to the Inquisitorial Squad
while they do the mission, and they have to answer on the basis of their observations so far. You may
assume that the at beginning of the mission dont exist friendship or enmity relationships between any
two students.

## Output

```
Input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n and q (1  n  10000, 1 
q  100000), the number of Hogwarts students and the number of operations made by the Inquisitorial
Squad. Each of the q following lines contains 3 integers c, x and y (0  x, y < n), where x and y are
the number of the student and c is the code of the operation:

 c = 1 means that the Inquisitorial Squad mark the relationship of students x and y as friendship.
This relationship will be saved only if it does not contradict with previously detected relationships.

 c = 2 means that the Inquisitorial Squad mark the relationship of students x and y as enmity.
This relationship will be saved only if it does not contradict with previously detected relationships.

 c = 3 means that Umbridge ask the Inquisitorial Squad if students x and y are friends.

 c = 4 means that Umbridge ask the Inquisitorial Squad if students x and y are enemies.
