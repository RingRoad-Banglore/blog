title: Uva 10804  Gopher Strategy
---


## Input

```text
Agent Cooper: Look at that! Ducks... on the lake!

Harley Peyton, "Twin Peaks."

Gophers like to feed in the field, but they always have to look out for hawks that might hunt them. A
group of gophers have decided to get more organized and need your help developing an escape strategy
in case of a hawk attack.

Given the coordinates of m gophers and n holes in the field, what is the minimum time required for
each gopher to reach a hole (at most one gopher per hole)? Every gopher runs in a straight line at a
speed of 1 unit per second, and the group can tolerate the loss of at most k gophers. (Gophers are lost
when they do not have enough time to reach an empty hole.)
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N . N test cases follow. Each one starts with a
line containing the integers m, n and k (0  m,n  50, 0  k  m). The next m lines will give the
x,y-coordinates of the gophers. The n lines after that will give the coordinates of the holes.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the line Case #x:, where x is the number of the test case. Then print the
minimum number of seconds required for at least m k gophers to reach a hole, rounded to 3 decimal
places. Every answer will obey the formula

|ans  103  ans  103  0.5| > 102

Print Too bad. if there is no solution. Print an empty line after each test case.

```
