title: Uva 11303  Permutation

## Input

```text
Given a subsequence of a permutation of n elements (1, 2, . . . , n), you have to find the K-th permutation
in lexicographic order that contains the subsequence given.

For example: If you have 1, 3, 2 and n equals to 4 you can obtain these permutations:

1, 3, 2, 4
1, 3, 4, 2
1, 4, 3, 2
4, 1, 3, 2
```

## Output

```text
Input file contains several test cases. The first line of the test case contains three integers n (1  n 
250), m (0 < m  n) m is the number of the elements of the subsequence and K, in the next line
contains m integers.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case write a K-th permutation that satisfies the condition, one per line.

Notice: K-th position always exists.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4 3 1
1 3 2
4 3 3
1 3 2
4 3 4
1 3 2
8 4 1000
8 2 4 1

```
