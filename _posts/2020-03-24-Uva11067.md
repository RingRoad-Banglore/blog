title: Uva 11067  Little Red Riding Hood
---


## Input

```
You probably all know the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood and how she wanted to visit her
grandmother, but on her way there met a wolf, finally got eaten by the wolf and was rescued in the end
by a brave hunter. Now if Little Red Riding Hood hadnt met the wolf in the first place, she would have
avoided a lot of hassle (she wouldnt have been eaten by the wolf and the brave hunter wouldnt have
had to rescue her). That she met the wolf in the first place was partly due to her lack of information.
She simply didnt know where she might encounter the wolf.

The network of roads connecting Little Red Riding Hoods house and her grandmothers house is
a rectangular grid. Little Red Riding Hoods house is situated on the grids lower left corner and her
grandmothers house is at the grids top right corner. Being particularly bright at math Little Red
Riding Hood always wants to get to her grandmother using the shortest possible route. This entails
that Little Red Riding Hood can only move to right or upwards on the grid. This ensures that she
always uses a shortest route. Now if she had known the wolfs possible locations in advance, she might
have chosen a path on which she doesnt meet the wolf.

Now given the size of the grid and the wolfs possible locations (weirdly enough the wolf can only
meet her at the grids intersections) compute the number of possible paths from Little Red Riding
Hoods house to her grandmothers house under the restriction that Little Red Riding Hood can only
move to the right and upwards and does not meet the wolf.
```

## Output

```
There will be several testcases. The grids width w, 1  w  100, and grids height h, 1  h  100, are
on the first line. The last testcase will contain a 0 for height h and a 0 for the width w and should not
be processed. In the next line there follows the number n, 0  n  100 of the wolfs possible locations.
The next n lines contain two integers each. The first denoting the wolfs x, 0  x  100 coordinate,
the second the wolfs y, 0  y  100 coordinate. Little Red Riding Hoods House is at the point (0,0)
and the grandmothers house is at (w, h). The wolf cannot be at either house.

## Sample Input

```
Output one line for each testcase. If there is more than one path between Little Red Riding Hoods
house and the grandmothers house on which Little Red Riding Hood doesnt meet the wolf and only
moves right and upwards, output the number of paths in the format:
There are X paths from Little Red Riding Hood's house to her grandmother's house.

If there is exactly one path print:
There is one path from Little Red Riding Hood's house to her grandmother's house.

Otherwise print:
There is no path.

The number of paths will always be  232  1.
