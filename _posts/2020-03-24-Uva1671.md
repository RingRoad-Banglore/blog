## Input

```

We are examining two specific classes of languages (a possibly infinite set of strings) in this problem.
Fortunately (or maybe unfortunately), we are not given the strings contained in each language directly,
rather we are given two deterministic finite automatons that describe such languages.

Your task here is simple: to determine if the languages described by the two automatons are the
same.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the concept of deterministic finite automata, you may use
the following information:

A deterministic finite automata (DFA) is a 5-tuple, (S,, T, s, A), consisting of

 a finite set of states (S)

 a finite set called the alphabet ()

 a transition function (T : S    S)

 a start state (s  S)

 a set of accept states (A  S)

Let M be a DFA such that M = (S,, T, s, A), and X = x0x1 . . . xn be a string over the
alphabet . M accepts the string X if a sequence of states, r0, r1, . . . , rn, exists in S with
the following conditions:

1. r0 = s

2. ri+1 = T (ri, xi), for i = 0, . . . , n 1

3. rn  A.

## Output

```
There are multiple test cases in the input file.

The first line of each test case is one integer, T (2  T  26), the size of the alphabet. In each
test case, the description of automaton A comes before that of automaton B. The description of each
automaton starts with one line containing N (1  N  2000), the number of states in the automaton,
followed by N lines, each line of the format: F,X0, X1, . . . , XT1, (F  {0, 1}, 1  Xi < N). If F = 1,
then the state is an accepting state; also, if Xi = 1, it means that the state has no corresponding
transition available for character i. The start state of both finite automatons will always be state 0.

Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with a single 0 indicates the end
of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, please print Yes if the two languages described by the automatons are equivalent;
output No otherwise.
