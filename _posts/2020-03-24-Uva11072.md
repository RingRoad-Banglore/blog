title: Uva 11072  Points
---


```
In this problem you will be given a set of points in the Eu-
clidian plane. The number of points in the set will never
exceed 100000. The coordinates of these points will be in-
teger coordinates and will have an absolute value smaller
than 10000. There will be no identical points in the first
set. Then you will be given a second set of points. For each
point in the second set you will have to determine whether
it lies in a triangle spanned by three points in the first set.
A point lying on the edge of a triangle is considered to be
inside the triangle.

In the example on the right the points p1, p2, p3, p4 be-
long to the first set. The points r and s belong to the second
set. The point r isnt contained in any triangle spanned by
three points of the first set. The point s is contained in two
triangles. For example, the triangle spanned by p2, p3, p4.
```

## Input

```
You will be given several testcases. A testcases consists of the number of points p, 3  p  100000
in the first set. It is followed by p pairs of numbers, each describing a point of the first set, the first
number of a pair denoting the x-coordinate of the point, the second the y-coordinate. Each pair is on
a seperate line. There may be colinear points in the first set. The next number in the input gives you
the number of points r in the second set. It is followed by r pairs of numbers, each describing a point,
each on a separate line. The first number of a pair being the x-coordinate, the second number being
the y-coordinate of the point. All coordinates in the input will be integer coordinates.

```

## Output

```
For each point in the second set, output if the point lies in a triangle spanned by three points of the
first set. If the point lies inside a triangle output inside otherwise output outside.
