title: Uva 13153  Number of Connected Components
---


```
Given N nodes, each node is labeled with an integer between 1 and 106 (inclusive and labels are
not necessarily distinct). Two nodes have an edge between them, if and only if the GCD (Greatest
Common Divisor) of the labels of these nodes is greater than 1. Count the number of connected
components in the graph.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input T (T  100) denotes the number of testcases. Then T cases follow. Each case
consists of 2 lines. The first line has a number N (1  N  105) denoting the number of nodes. The
next line consists of N numbers. The i-th (1  i  n) number Xi (1  Xi  106) denotes the label of
the node i.

```

## Output

```
For each case you have to print a line consisting consisting the case number followed by an integer
which denotes the number of connected components. Look at the output for sample input for details.
