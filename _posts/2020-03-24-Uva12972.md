title: Uva 12972  Cuban Challenge
---


## Input

```
Mr. Ed is visiting his pals at Cuba; in particular he wants to have a nice chat with Yonny, who is a
very talented domino player. After taking a few rounds of rum, everybody got ready to play domino.
As Mr. Ed and Yonny are close friends, they make an invincible team at domino. They won every
single game against their friends, so they started to get bored of playing. Do you feel you play domino
as good as a true Cuban?  asked Yonny. I play even better  presumed Mr. Ed.

Now Yonny has challenged Mr. Ed to complete the following
task: I have a wood board divided in n rows of m columns such
that there are nm squares of equal size on it. The challenge is
simple: use as many dominoes as you want to cover each single
square in the board without overlapping, but not so fast, that will
be pretty easy, right? There are some squares colored in black,
you cannot put a domino on this squares. Here, let me show you
an example.

Just because you are my friend, I will let you cut some domi-
noes in half if you have trouble completing the challenge, but for
every domino you cut, you shall pay a small fee to buy more
dominoes for me.

As you may expect, now Mr. Ed is all fired up trying to beat Yonnys challenge, so he is trying
to answer: which is the minimum number of dominoes he needs to cut in order to fill every single
non-black square in the nm wood board?
```

## Output

```
The input will contain several test cases. The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and m
(1  n  20 and 1  m  1, 000), representing the number of rows and columns in the board. Each of
the next n lines contains m characters describing each square in the wood board: . means there is an
empty square and # means there is a black square in the wood board.

The last test case is followed by a single line containing 2 zeroes.

```
