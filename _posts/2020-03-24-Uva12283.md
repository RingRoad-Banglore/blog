```
Gappu has a very busy weekend ahead of him. Because, next weekend
is Halloween, and he is planning to attend as many parties as he can.
Since its Halloween, these parties are all costume parties, Gappu always
selects his costumes in such a way that it blends with his friends, that
is, when he is attending the party, arranged by his comic-book-fan
friends, he will go with the costume of Superman, but when the party
is arranged contestbuddies, he would go with the costume of Chinese
Postman.

Since he is going to attend a number of parties on the Halloween
night, and wear costumes accordingly, he will be changing his costumes
a number of times. So, to make things a little easier, he may put on
costumes one over another (that is he may wear the uniform for the
postman, over the superman costume). Before each party he can take
off some of the costumes, or wear a new one. That is, if he is wearing
the Postman uniform over the Superman costume, and wants to go to
a party in Superman costume, he can take off the Postman uniform, or he can wear a new Superman
uniform. But, keep in mind that, Gappu doesnt like to wear dresses without cleaning them first, so,
after taking off the Postman uniform, he cannot use that again in the Halloween night, if he needs the
Postman costume again, he will have to use a new one. He can take off any number of costumes, and if
he takes off k of the costumes, that will be the last k ones (e.g. if he wears costume A before costume
B, to take off A, first he has to remove B).

Given the parties and the costumes, find the minimum number of costumes Gappu will need in the
Halloween night.
