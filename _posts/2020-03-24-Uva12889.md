title: Uva 12889  Happy Birthday Tutu
---


## Input

```
Tutu is a jolly little kitten who is the biggest fan of stone games. His elder brother Milo designed a
game for him on the occasion of his 2-nd birthday. But Tutu needs another player to play with him,
otherwise he will get sad, even on his birthday! :-(. You, being a good old fella, cant let that happen.
So you decided to play with Tutu. But none of you want to lose, so you both play optimally, but as it
is his birthday, you let Tutu make the first move.

The game consists of K piles, each pile has Ai (1  i  K) stones. In each turn, a player can select
any number of piles but not all piles (i.e. at most K  1 arbitrary piles) and take any number of stones
from all of the selected piles (you can take stones from multiple piles in single move). Note that, the
player cannot make an empty move, i.e. at least one stone must be taken in each move. The player,
who cannot make a move, loses the game.

Given the number of piles and the number of stones in each of the piles, can you determine who
wins the game, given that both of you play optimally?
```
