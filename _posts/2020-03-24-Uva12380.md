title: Uva 12380  Glimmr in Distress
---


```
In a special compression technique used by a photo sharing site Glimmr to compress its database of
images, a simple preprocessing is used. As you may know, any digital image is comprised of several
matrices, one for each channel, of binary values. Each of these matrices can further be broken up
into a couple of Boolean matrices associated with binary places (20 21 22 . . .). In other words, each
digit of a binary pixel value appears in the corresponding coordinates of a B&W (black-and-white)
image pertinent to the digits place-value. Thus, we can represent a color image with a collection of
same-size B&W images. The preprocessing phase is carried out on each B&W image which without
loss of generality we assume to be of size 2n  2n. As a result, the image is converted to a string of
characters 0, 1 and 2. More specifically, the string representation of an image of uniform 1s is a
single-character string 1 and that of uniform 0s, the string 0. For non-uniform values, the image is
split into four sub-images of size 2n1  2n1, as seen below. The string translation in this case starts
with the character 2 followed by the string codes for sub-images in order from left to right, top to
bottom, that is S1S2S3S4.

I1 I2
I3 I4

For example, the string representing the following 2 2 image is 21001.

1 0
0 1

These strings are further processed to achieve a good level of compression and then stored. Unfortu-
nately, a recent act of sabotage (probably with an EMP micro bomb) by a rival company has left their
database damaged with garbled values. As a result, when one wants to decompress and reconstruct
images they run into strings that may have some characters altered and some others lost. Therefore,
Glimmr is pursuing a disaster recovery plan. To start with, they intend to identify damaged strings
and for those seemingly unharmed, find their minimum consistent image size, since size information is
also missing.

## Input

```
The first line of input contains an integer T  1, 000 denoting the number of test-cases. Each test-case
is represented by a single line containing a string of size of at most 2,500 of characters 0, 1 and 2.

```

## Output

```
For each test-case, if the string is not a valid representation of a B&W image output Not Possible
with no quotes. And if it is valid, output the minimum possible size of the image in the format 2^n*2^n
as seen in the sample output.
