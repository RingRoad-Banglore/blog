## Input

```text
Your city mayor have finally decided to end the misery of all the residents and introduced a free bus
service. The service will consist of two buses, going through various roads in the city in a circular path.

As the chief architect of this design, you are assigned to check if a given design has any fault. A
design will be faulty, if there is such a state that both buses visit the same cell in the city at the same
time.

The city was originally designed like a rectangular grid (30  30). Both of the buses can move
through the city, from one cell to another, in 4 directions (up, down, left, right). Current cell and
the next destination cell will always be situated either parallel to X-axis or Y -axis. Also, the distance
between the cells will at least be one. Two buses start their journey at the same time and can move
one cell at a time in the direction of its next destination.

Suppose, the route of a bus contains p0, p1, p2, , pn1. Then this bus will start its journey from
p0 and continue through the grid to reach p1, then p2, , pn1, p0, p1, p2, .... (continuing for infinite
times).

Given the route for both buses, you are to determine if the route design is faulty or not. Remember
that the buses will not collide when they cross each other at the cell border, hence the design will not
be faulty.

## Output

```text
Input start with an integer T (T  20), denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case starts with a blank line. The next line contains an integer N (2  N  30) denoting
the number of destinations the first bus will visit. Each of the next N lines will contain two integers xi,
yi (0  xi, yi < 30) denoting the coordinate of a cell. The next line contains an integer M (2  M  30)
denoting the number of destinations the second bus will visit. Each of the next M lines will contain
two integers xi, yi (0  xi, yi < 30) denoting the coordinate of a destination cell.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number and (x, y) which is the cell where first collision between the buses.
If there is no collision then print No Collision.

Note: The picture on the right il-
lustrate the sample cases below.
