title: Uva 11744  Parallel Carry Adder
---


## Input

```
Let a and b be two 31-bit binary num-
bers. Consider the following method
for computing a+ b. Let c, d be 31-bit
numbers such that:

 ci = 1 if ai = bi

 ci = 0 if ai = bi

 di = 1 if ai = bi = 1

 di = 0 if ai = 0 or bi = 0

Now, replace a with c and b with
2d and repeat these steps until either
b = 0 or b  231. In the former case,
the resulting value of a is the sum of
the original numbers. In the latter case, the sum of the original numbers requires 32 bits to express so
we say that an overflow has occurred.

Your task is to print the results of all intermediate calculations and report if an overflow occurs.
```

## Output

```
The first number indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two 31-bit numbers a
and b.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output for each test case is a series of lines. The first line consists of a and b written in binary
and separated by a space. Following this, each line consists of the resulting values of a and b when
one iteration of the algorithm is applied to the values in the previous line. Again, these should be
written in binary and separated by a space. If any of these numbers has value at least 231 then the
message overflow should be printed in place of the number. The last line of output to be printed
corresponds to the iteration when either b = 0 or b  231. The output for consecutive input cases
should be separated by a blank line.
