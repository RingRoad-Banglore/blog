title: Uva 00288  Arithmetic Operations With Large Integers
---


## Input

```text
This problem is about calculations with large numbers. Large means numbers with at most one thousand
digits. The operations are limited to addition, substraction, multiplication and raising to a higher power.

There are no limitations to the operants of addition, substraction and multiplication. The base in
raising to higher powers is positive and smaller than ten. The exponent is positive.

The inputfile consists of a valid expression with any number of operations. There are no parentheses,
but the normal arithmetic priority rules are still valid.

An example of a valid expression is: 12345678 * 129876 + 2**1993. An invalid expression is:
12345678 * 129876 + 12**1993 because the base is greater than nine.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases, each one on a different line.

Each test case contains numbers and operands in the following way:

nopn{opn }.
n is a positive decimal number with at most one thousand digits, stored as an ASCII-text. op is

one of the following: +, -, *, ** (** means raising to higher powers). There can be at most one
hundred operations per test case. There are no spaces or other illegal characters in the input.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output contains the exact result of the evaluated expressions given in the input. Print each test
case in a different line (in the sample below, the output line is splited by visual reasons, but it must be
just a line in your output).

Each test case wont have more than three thousand characters.

```

## Sample Output

```text
12345678*129876+2**1993

```
