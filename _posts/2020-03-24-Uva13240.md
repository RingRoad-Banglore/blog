---


## Input

```text
Let d(n) be the sum of all divisors of n. For example d(6) = 1+2+3+6 = 12. Given integers n and k,
compute the sum of all integers m for 1  m < n, such that d(m) is a multiple of k, i.e. d(m) = l  k,
where l is a positive integer.
```

## Output

```text
A number of of inputs ( 100), each start with the number of value of integers n, k (1  n, k 
10000000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output the answer modulo 1000000007.

```

## Sample Output

```text
10 5
20 5

```
