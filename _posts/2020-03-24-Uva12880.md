The famous staircase in Lello bookstore,
downtown Porto.

Portos book club is buzzing with excitement for the
annual book exchange event! Every year, members
bring their favorite book and try to find another book
they like that is owned by someone willing to trade
with them.

I have been to this book exchange before, and I def-
initely do not want to miss it this year, but I feel that
the trading should be improved. In the past, pairs of
members interested in each others books would sim-
ply trade: imagine that person A brought a book that
person B liked and vice-versa, then A and B would
exchange their books.

I then realized that many members were left with
the same book they walked-in with... If instead of look-
ing for pairs I looked for triplets, I could find more valid exchanges! Imagine that member A only likes
member Bs book, while B only likes Cs book and C likes As book. These 3 people could trade their
books in a cycle and everyone would be happy!

But why stop at triplets? Cycles could be bigger and bigger! Could you help me find if it is possible
for everyone to go out with a new book? Be careful, because members will not give their book without
receiving one they like in return.

Given the members of the book club and the books they like, can we find cycles so that everyone
receives a new book?

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line has two integers: N , the number of people, and M , the total number of declarations
of interest. Each of the following M lines has two integers, A and B, indicating that member A likes
the book that member B brought (0  A,B < N). Numbers A and B will never be the same (a
member never likes the book he brought).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, you should output YES if we can find a new book for every club member and NO
if that is not possible.
