title: Uva 01512  ASCII Expression
---


```

Mathematical expressions appearing in old papers and old technical articles are printed with typewriter
in several lines, where a fixed-width or monospaced font is required to print characters (digits, symbols
and spaces). Let us consider the following mathematical expression.

(
1

4

32

)2
5 + 6

It is printed in the following four lines:

4 2

( 1 - ---- ) * - 5 + 6

2

3

where - 5 indicates unary minus followed by 5. We call such an expression of lines ASCII expres-
sion.

For helping those who want to evaluate ASCII expressions obtained through optical character recog-
nition (OCR) from old papers, your job is to write a program that recognizes the structure of ASCII
expressions and computes their values.

For the sake of simplicity, you may assume that ASCII expressions are constructed by the following
rules. Its syntax is shown in Table H.1.

(1) Terminal symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, -, *, (, ), and  .

(2) Nonterminal symbols are expr, term, factor, powexpr, primary, fraction and digit. The start
symbol is expr.

(3) A cell is a rectangular region of characters that corresponds to a terminal or nonterminal
symbol (Figure H.1). In the cell, there are no redundant rows and columns that consist only of
space characters. A cell corresponding to a terminal symbol consists of a single character. A cell
corresponding to a nonterminal symbol contains cell(s) corresponding to its descendant(s) but
never partially overlaps others.

(4) Each cell has a base-line, a top-line, and a bottom-line. The base-lines of child cells of the right-
hand side of rules I, II, III, and V should be aligned. Their vertical position defines the base-line
position of their left-hand side cell.

Table H.1: Rules for constructing ASCII expressions (similar to Backus-Naur Form)

The box indicates the cell of the terminal or nonterminal symbol that corresponds to a rectangular region

of characters. Note that each syntactically-needed space character is explicitly indicated by the period

character denoted by . , here.

Figure H.1: Top, base, bottom lines: expr 1 4
32
, fraction 4

32
, powexpr 32, and digit 3.

(5) powexpr consists of a primary and an optional digit. The digit is placed one line above the base-
line of the primary cell. They are horizontally adjacent to each other. The base-line of a powexpr
is that of the primary.

(6) fraction is indicated by three or more consecutive hyphens called vinculum. Its dividend expr
is placed just above the vinculum, and its divisor expr is placed just beneath it. The number
of the hyphens of the vinculum, denoted by wh, is equal to 2 + max(w1, w2), where w1 and w2
indicate the width of the cell of the dividend and that of the divisor, respectively. These cells
are centered, where there are (wh wk)/2 space characters to the left and (wh wk)/2 space
characters to the right, (k = 1, 2). The base-line of a fraction is at the position of the vinculum.

(7) digit consists of one character.

For example, the negative fraction 3
4
is represented in three lines:

3

- ---

4

where the left-most hyphen means a unary minus operator. One space character is required between
the unary minus and the vinculum of the fraction.

The fraction 3+42122 is represented in four lines:

3 + 4 * - 2

-------------

2

- 1 - 2



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1512  ASCII Expression 3/5

where the widths of the cells of the dividend and divisor are 11 and 8 respectively. Hence the number
of hyphens of the vinculum is 2 + max(11, 8) = 13. The divisor is centered by (13  8)/2 = 3 space
characters (hyphens) to the left and (13 8)/2 = 2 to the right.

The powexpr (42)3 is represented in two lines:

2 3

( 4 )

where the cell for 2 is placed one line above the base-line of the cell for 4, and the cell for 3 is placed
one line above the base-line of the cell for a primary (42).

## Input

```
The input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line containing a zero. Each dataset has the
following format.

n
str1
str2
...
strn

n is a positive integer, which indicates the number of the following lines with the same length that
represent the cell of an ASCII expression. strk is the k-th line of the cell where each space character is
replaced with a period.

You may assume that n  20 and that the length of the lines is no more than 80.

```

## Output

```
For each dataset, one line containing a non-negative integer less than 2011 should be output. The
integer indicates the value of the ASCII expression in modular arithmetic under modulo 2011. The
output should not contain any other characters.

There is no fraction with the divisor that is equal to zero or a multiple of 2011.

Note that powexpr x0 is defined as 1, and xy (y is a positive integer) is defined as the product
x x . . . x where the number of xs is equal to y.

A fraction x is computed as the multiplication of x and the inverse of y, i.e., x  inv(y), under y
modulo 2011. The inverse of y (1  y < 2011) is uniquely defined as the integer z (1  z < 2011) that
satisfies z  y  1 (mod 2011), since 2011 is a prime number.
