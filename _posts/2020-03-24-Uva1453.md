## Input

```

The famous Korean IT company plans to make a digital map of the Earth with help of wireless
sensors which spread out in rough terrains. Each sensor sends a geographical data to . But, due
to the inaccuracy of the sensing devices equipped in the sensors, only knows a square region in
which each geographical data happens. Thus a geographical data can be any point in a square region.
You are asked to solve some geometric problem, known as diameter problem, on these undetermined
points in the squares.

A diameter for a set of points in the plane is defined
as the maximum (Euclidean) distance among pairs of the
points in the set. The diameter is used as a measurement
to estimate the geographical size of the set. wants
you to compute the largest diameter of the points chosen
from the squares. In other words, given a set of squares
in the plane, you have to choose exactly one point from
each square so that the diameter for the chosen points is
maximized. The sides of the squares are parallel to X-axis
or Y -axis, and the squares may have different sizes, intersect
each other, and share the same corners.

For example, if there are six squares as in the figure
on the right, then the largest diameter is defined as the
distance between two corner points of squares S1 and S4.

Given a set of n squares in the plane, write a program
to compute the largest diameter D of the points when a point is chosen from each square, and to output
D2, i.e., the squared value of D.
```

## Output

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. The first line of each test case contains an integer, n, the
number of squares, where 2  n  100, 000. Each line of the next n lines contains three integers, x, y,
and w, where (x, y) is the coordinate of the left-lower corner of a square and w is the length of a side
of the square; 0  x, y  10, 000 and 1  w  10, 000.

```

## Sample Input

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should
contain the integral value D2, where D is the largest diameter of the points when a point is chosen
from each square.
