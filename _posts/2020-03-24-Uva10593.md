title: Uva 10593  Kites
---


## Input

```text
The season of flying kites is well ahead. So what? Let us make an inventory for kites. We are given
a square shaped sheet of paper. But many parts of this are already porous. Your challenge here is to
count the total number of ways to cut a kite of any size from this sheet. By the way, the kite itself
cant be porous :-) AND it must be either square shaped or diamond shaped.

In the above figure first three are valid kites but not next two.
```

## Output

```text
Input contains an integer n (n  500), which is the size of the sheet. Then follows n lines each of which
has n characters (x or .). Here the dotted parts resemble the porous parts of the sheet. Input is
terminated by end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output is very simple. Only print an integer according to the problem statement for each test case in
a new line.
