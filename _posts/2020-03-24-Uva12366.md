## Input

```text
Poker is one of the most widely played card games, and Kings Poker is one of its variations. The game
is played with a normal deck of 52 cards. Each card has one of 4 suits and one of 13 ranks. However,
in Kings Poker card suits are not relevant, while ranks are Ace (rank 1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack
(rank 11), Queen (rank 12) and King (rank 13). The name of the game comes from the fact that in
Kings Poker, the King is the highest ranked card. But this is not the only difference between regular
Poker and Kings Poker. Players of Kings Poker are dealt a hand of just three cards. There are three
types of hands:

 A set, made of three cards of the same rank.

 A pair, which contains two cards of the same rank, with the other card unmatched.

 A no-pair, where no two cards have the same rank.

Hands are ranked using the following rules:

 Any set defeats any pair and any no-pair.

 Any pair defeats any no-pair.

 A set formed with higher ranked cards defeats any set formed with lower ranked cards.

 If the matched cards of two pairs have different ranks, then the pair with the higher ranked
matched cards defeats the pair with the lower ranked matched cards.

 If the matched cards of two pairs have the same rank, then the unmatched card of both hands
are compared; the pair with the higher ranked unmatched card defeats the pair with the lower
ranked unmatched card, unless both unmatched cards have the same rank, in which case there is
a tie.

A new software house wants to offer Kings Poker games in its on-line playing site, and needs a
piece of software that, given a hand of Kings Poker, determines the set or pair with the lowest rank
that beats the given hand. Can you code it?
