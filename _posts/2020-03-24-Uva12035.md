## Input

```text
The country you live in is actually a land of rivers. Almost every city of the country is surrounded
by rivers. Fortunately there are many bridges in the country that connect the cities. Suddenly the
country is under attack and the opposition is trying to destroy the bridges to isolate the cities. You,
as a commander of a sector, now want to know the current status of the sector. The sector consists of
N cities. You asked your assistant to collect the current connectivity information of the sector. But
he could only manage to get di for each of the cities in the sector. Here di represents the number of
different cities to which city i is directly connected. Note that a city is not considered to be connected
with itself. Now, you want to draw a graph that is consistent with the information. You also want to
give each of the cities a color such that directly connected cities do not have same color. But you have
only two colors to use. You want to know whether such a graph can be drawn.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 500), denoting the number of test cases. Each case starts with a line
containing an integer N (2  N  20). The next line contains N integers di (0  di  N).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number and YES if its possible to draw such a graph or NO if it isnt.
Notes:

For case 2, you can draw the following graph For case 3, you can draw the following graph, but
using only two colors it cant be colored.
