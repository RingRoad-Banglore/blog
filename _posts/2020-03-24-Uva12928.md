title: Uva 12928  Death Star
---


## Input

```
The Death Star is the greatest space station made by The Empire,
the forces of darkness. This incredible space station could destroy
one planet with just one shot of its high frequency laser and its
colossal ion cannon.

The Empire is executing the order 3.1415, his target is to
destroy The moon Endor, a beautiful natural satellite where The
Rebels have their assault base. The Death Star is in position to
fire, but its weapon takes around 5 minutes to reload.

The Empire has made this weapon with the shape of a five-
edged star. When the weapon is loaded the five outer points of the
star looks incandescent, and then they can fire and destroy their
target. However, this weapon has five weak points: the difference
between the star of the weapon minus the circumscribed pentagon
of the middle of the same star, in other words, the triangles of
the star, including the lines that form it.

You are a rebel commander, and your mission is to fly an x-wing and destroy the weapon of the
Death Star shooting at the weak points.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. A test case starts with five lines, each one has a pairs of
integers x, y (500  x, y  500) that represents the Cartesian coordinates of the pentagon in which
the weapon that has the shape of a star is inscribed. These points are in clockwise order.

The next line has an integer n (1  n  100), that represents the number of bullets fired at the
weapon.

The next n lines have a pair of integer x, y that represents the Cartesian coordinate of the impact
of the bullets.

```

## Sample Input

```
If the five points couldnt inscribe a star, print on a single line Impossible, otherwise, if a rebels
bullet impacts in one of the weak point of the weapon print Yes, but if the bullet doesnt impact print
