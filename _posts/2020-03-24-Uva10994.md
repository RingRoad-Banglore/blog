---


## Input

```
Lets define a simple recursive function F (n), where

F (n) = p(x) =




n%10, if (n%10) > 0
0, if n = 0
F (n/10), Otherwise

Lets define another function S(p, q),

S(p, q) =

q
i=p

F (i)

In this problem you have to Calculate S(p, q) on given value of p and q.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains several lines of inputs. Each line contains two non negative integers p and q
(p  q) separated by a single space. p and q will fit in 32 bit signed integer. In put is terminated by a
line which contains two negative integers. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input print a single line of the value of S(p, q).

```

## Sample Output

```
1 10
10 20
30 40
-1 -1

```
