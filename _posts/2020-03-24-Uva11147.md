## Input

```text
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure, which obeys the following properties:

 Each nodes has at most 2 children.

 Each node except the root has exactly one parent.

 There is exactly one root node. The root node does not have any parents.

 If a node has a left child, all values in the left subtree are less than or equal to the value of the
value of the node itself.

 If a node has a right child, all values in the right subtree are strictly greater than the value of the
node itself.

A kuPellaKeS BST is a BST which have the following properties:

 The difference between sum of all values in the left subtree and sum of all values in the right
subtree is minimum.

 If there is more than one way to minimize the difference, sum of all values in the left subtree is
maximum.

 The right and left subtrees are also kuPellaKeS BSTs.

The following rules describe a representation way for a BST:

 A BST with no subtrees is denoted by
value_of_root (Quotes included for clarity).

 A BST which have only one subtree (Either left or right subtree), is denoted by
value_of_root(representation_of_subtree) (Quotes included for clarity).

 A BST which have both of its subtrees, is denoted by
value_of_root(representation_of_left_subtree,representation_of_right_subtree).

Given a list of integer numbers, output the representation of the kuPellaKeS BST having those
numbers as node values.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input gives the number of cases, T . Then, T test cases follow. Each one starts with a
line containing number of values 1  n  1000. Next line contains n integer numbers separated by a
single space.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For the x-th test case, your program must output the line containing Case #x:, followed by represen-
tation of the kuPellaKeS BST having the given numbers as node values.
