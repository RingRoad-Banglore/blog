title: Uva 11761  Super Heronian Triangle
---


## Input

```text
A Heronian Triangle has sides with integer length and integer area. For this problem, a Heronian
Triangle whose radius of circum-circle is also integer is called Super Heronian Triangle (SHT). Given
the radius of Circum Circle and area of an SHT, you will have to find such a triangle all whose side
lengths are less than 40001.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 300 lines of inputs. Each line contains two integers R (0 < R < 500000)
and A (0 < A < 700000000). Here R and A denotes the radius of circum circle and Area of an unknown
SHT. Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes which obviously should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line input produce one or more line of output. If there is no SHT with the given radius and
area and all side with lengths less than 40001, print three -1 (Minus 1) separated by single space.
Other wise print the length of sides of the SHT in ascending order. If there is more than one such
triangle print the one whose smallest side has minimum length.

```

## Sample Output

```text
5 24
5 23
0 0

```
