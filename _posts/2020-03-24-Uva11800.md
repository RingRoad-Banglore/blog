## Input

```text
A toy company recently found that toys like revolver, ma-
chine guns, fighting planes are making children violent and
destroying the peace of the world. The parents also be-
gan to avoid these toys and inclined to educational toys.
So they decided to manufacture educational toys. One of
these is a electric touch pad on which children can put four
points and the program will automatically join the points
to form a closed shape. Children will try to guess the shape
and when they press a button then it will automatically an-
nounce the shape. But they are struggling to determine the
shape and seek your help.

Your task is simple. You are given four points, no three
of them are collinear, you have to output the simple polyg-
onal shape formed by these points in the following order:

Square
Rectangle
Rhombus
Parallelogram
Trapezium
Ordinary Quadrilateral

For example if it is possible to form a square with the four points you must output Square, if it is
not possible to form a square but possible to form a rectangle you must output Rectangle and so on.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T , the number of test cases (T  50000). Each test case contains 4 lines.
Each of the lines contains two space separated integers xi yi (10000  xi, yi  10000) which are the
coordinate values of a point.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input output one line in the format Case k: s. Here k is the case number starting
from 1 and s is the shape as described above. See sample input output for more details.

Note: If you have forgotten elementary geometry, here is the definitions to remind you:

 Square: All sides are of equal size all angles are 90

 Rectangle: Opposite sides are of equal size and all angles are 90

 Rhombus: All sides are of equal size but no angle is 90

 Parallelogram: Opposite sides are of equal size but no angle is 90

 Trapezium: Any two opposite sides are parallel but the other two is not.

 Simple Polygon: Polygon having no self intersecting edge.
