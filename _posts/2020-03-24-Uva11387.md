title: Uva 11387  The 3Regular Graph
---


```
The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of edges adjacent to the vertex. A graph is 3-regular
if all of its vertices have degree 3. Given an integer n, you are to build a simple undirected 3-regular
graph with n vertices. If there are multiple solutions, any one will do.
```

## Input

```
For each test case, the input will be a single integer n as described above. End of input will be denoted
by a case where n = 0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
If it is possible to build a simple undirected 3-regular graph with n vertices, print a line with an integer
e which is the number of edges in your graph. Each of the following e lines describes an edge of the
graph. An edge description contains two integers a and b, the two endpoints of the edge. Note that the
vertices are indexed from 1 to n. If it is not possible to build a simple undirected 3-regular graph with
n vertices, print Impossible in a single line.
