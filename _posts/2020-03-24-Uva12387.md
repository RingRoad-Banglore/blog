title: Uva 12387  Alphabet Soup

## Input

```
Peter is having lunch at home. Unfortunately for him, todays meal is soup. As Peters mother is aware
that he doesnt like it very much, she has cooked a special soup using pasta pieces shaped like letters
from the alphabet, numbers and other characters. She has a special knife with which she can prepare
an unlimited supply of pasta pieces that may come in S different forms. The soup always has P pasta
pieces in it, and is so thick that the pieces never move.

Despite her efforts, Peter is still not happy with todays menu
and asks how many days in his life he will have to eat soup. His
mother promises him that she will prepare a different soup every
day, and that on no day will the dish contain the same shapes
in all positions as any soup dish previously served. However, the
number P of pasta pieces, as well as the positions in which pieces
float, will remain the same every day. Peter is not easily fooled
(or so he thinks), and he cleverly realizes that this can still make
him eat soup for ages. In an attempt to reduce the number of con-
figurations, he tells his mother he will not accept any dish which
can be obtained by rotating one of the configurations previously
seen.

Consider the dish as a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
All the symbols will be floating in the soup at a given angle (in
millidegrees) at distance 1 from the origin. Two plates are considered equal if you can perform a
rotation of one of the dishes about its center so that the positions of the symbols, as well as the symbols
themselves, are the same in both.

Your program will be given the number of possible symbols Peters mother has available, and the
angles determining the location of each of the pasta pieces (measured clockwise in millidegrees). Write
a program that returns the number of possible plates Peters mother can prepare. As this number can
be very large, output the number modulo 100, 000, 007 which is prime.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input in each test case contains two numbers: S (2  S  1, 000), the number of
symbols Peters mother can use; and P (P > 0), the number of pasta pieces floating in the soup. Each
of the next P lines contain the angle A (0  A < 360, 000) of one of the P pieces (measured clockwise
in millidegrees). All angles will be different.

Different tests cases are separated by a blank line. After the last test case there is a line with
S = P = 1.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output a single integer in a line by itself, the number of different plates Peters mother
can cook modulo 100, 000, 007.
