## Input

```text
You may already know magic squares. Here we introduce a more powerful one. Suppose we have a 55
square filled with numbers from 1 to 25, every number appear EXACTLY once, like this:

the sum of every row, every col, every diagonal (including non-main diagonals) are ALL the same. for
example,

14 + 20 + 21 + 2 + 8 = 19 + 8 + 22 + 11 + 5 = 1 + 24 + 17 + 15 + 8 = 19 + 2 + 15 + 23 + 6 = 65.

You may calculate these 20 sums yourself, then, youll know I am talking about.
This kind of squares (20 sums are ALL the same) is called POWERFUL MAGIC SQUARES. Your

task is: given a uncompleted square, count the number of powerful magic squares that can be obtained
by completing the square.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1  n  15000), the number of test cases followed.
For each case, there are five lines containing the uncompleted squares. Blank squares are represented
as --. Filled numbers are always between 1 and 25. every test case is followed by a blank line except
the last one.

The input format is always correct.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and the number of squares obtained, like shown below.
