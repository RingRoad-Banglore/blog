12426 Counting Triangles
You are given a convex polygon of N vertices. Find how many ways three vertices can be chosen such
that the triangle formed by those has an area not more than K.

## Input
The first line of input contains T which is the number of tests cases. Each case contains two integers
N and K. Each of the next N lines will contain two integers: xi yi denoting i-th vertex of the polygon.
The vertices will be given in anti-clockwise order.

## Output
For each test case output one line the number of ways to choose a triangle from the vertices of the
convex polygon whose area is not more than K.
