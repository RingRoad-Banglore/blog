Fig 1. Collision between the
spaceship and a rock

Candy and his friends found a treasure map. With the help of the map,
they successfully found the treasure inside an ancient cave, but just as
they took the large treasure box, the cave started to collapse!

Candy must find a way out, but the rocks are falling down so quickly
that its impossible to run out with bare feet. After carefully examined
the treasure box, they found a digit panel, a button, and a small piece
of paper. I am not an ordinary treasure box, I am a mini-spaceship,
your last hope to escape. Use the digit panel to setup my speed, then
press the button to launch. Ill fly from left to right, until I reach the
exit. The trouble is: I am very weak. Ill explode immediately when hit
by any falling rock, but if Im just touching one, its ok. When flying, I
burn the treasures inside. The higher my speed is, the more treasures I
will burn. Thus, be sure to find an appropriate speed before starting your journey. The last thing you
need to know is: dont be too slow. The exit will be blocked after a while.

A list of rocks that will fall down is enclosed in that piece of paper. All the rocks have the same
speed. Each rock continues to fall down until its topmost point reaches the land (i.e. y = 0).You can
start your journey at any time, but once you launch the spaceship, it never stops before reaching the
exit or being destroyed!

Write a program to find the minimal speed that takes you out of the cave.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of each case contains seven positive integers n,
a, b, L, H, V , T (1  n  50, 1  a, b  10, 1  L,H, V, T  10000). The spaceship is a units
wide and b units high. Its bottom-left corner is initially (i.e. at time 0) at (0, 0). When the bottom-
left corner reaches (L, 0) before time T , you succeeded. The height of the cave is H. The speed
of each rock is V . There are n lines followed. Each of these lines contains three integers xi, ri, ti
(1  ti  T, 1  ri  200, a+ ri  xi  L ri, b < H ri): at time ti, there will be a falling rock with a
radius of ri with its center at (xi,H). The descriptions of rocks are sorted in increasing order of falling
time. The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the minimal speed to two decimal places. It is always
possible to escape.
