title: Uva 12297  Super Poker
---


```
I have a set of super poker cards, consisting of an infinite number of cards. For each positive integer
p, there are exactly four cards whose value is p: Spade(S), Heart(H), Club(C) and Diamond(D). There
are no cards of other values.

Given two positive integers n and k, how many ways can you pick up at most k cards whose values
sum to n? For example, if n = 15 and k = 3, one way is 3H + 4S + 8H, shown below:
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 20 test cases, each with two integers n and k (1  n  109, 1  k  10). The
input is terminated by n = k = 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the number of ways, modulo 1,000,000,009.

```

## Sample Input

```
2 1
2 2
2 3
50 5
0 0

```

## Sample Output

```
