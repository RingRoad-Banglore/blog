## Input

```
It is now the year  2200 and programming contest activities have spread around the world like never
before. It has been estimated that there may be as many as  107 world class contestants in the world.
Now your job is to form a team consisting of contestants only. Exactly one of the team members must
be a team leader  (TL) , exactly one must be lead developer  (LD) , exactly one must be lead tester
(LT) , exactly one must be marketing manager  (MM) . Of course same person can hold more than one
of these four posts. Anyone not holding any of these posts is an ordinary worker  (OW) . Given the
total number of world class contestants  N  , your task is to find out in how many ways can you form
such a team.  Two  teams  are  different,  if  any  one  of  the  following  conditions  is  satisfied:

i)   Total  number  of  contestants  in  the  two  teams  is  different.

ii)   Two  teams  have  same  number  of  contestants  and  at  least  one  contestant  is  different.

iii)   Two  teams  have  same  contestants  and  at  least  one  contestant  plays  different  role.

For  example  consider  the  following  teams:

Member  1 Member  2 Member  3 Member  4
Team  A Contestant  A  (TL) Contestant  B  (LD) Contestant  C  (LT) Contestant  D(MM)
Team  B Contestant  A  (TL &  MM) Contestant  B  (LD) Contestant  C  (LT) Contestant  D  (OW)
Team  C Contestant  A  (TL) Contestant  B  (LD) Contestant  C  (LT) Contestant  E(MM)
Team  D Contestant  A  (TL) Contestant  B  (LD) Contestant  D  (MM) Contestant  C  (LT)
Team E Contestant  A  (TL &  LD &&  MM) Contestant  B  (OW) Contestant  D  (OW) Contestant  C  (LT)

Here Team A and Team B are different (although members are same) as contestant A and contestant
D have difference in their roles, Team A and Team C are different because member 4 are two different
persons, Team A and Team D is the same team as all members and their corresponding roles are same
(only written in different order). Team E is valid because there can be more than one OW.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains at most  10001 lines of input.

Each line contains an integer  N (0 < N < 10000001) denoting the total number of world class
contestants. Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.  This  line  should  not  be  processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer  W denoting the total
number of ways to form a team.

As this value can be too big, please output the modulo  100000007 (108 + 7)  value  of  W  (or
W % 100000007).
