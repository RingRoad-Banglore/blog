1227 The longest constant gene

Thousands of genomes, from virus to human, are
available in public databases. Each genome is pre-
sented as a string of nucleotides: ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’, and
‘T’. To study the relationship among organisms, their
genomes are analyzed. A sequence of nucleotides is
called a constant gene if it appears in all genomes.

Given N genomes, your task is to write a pro-
gram to find the longest constant gene among these
genomes.

## Input

The input file consists of several data sets. The first
line of the input file contains the number of data sets
which is a positive integer and is not bigger than 20.
The following lines describe the data sets.

For each data set, the first line contains the integer N (1 < N < 7) indicating the number of
genomes. Each line in the next N following lines contains one genome (the length of each genome is
limited to one million).

## Output

For each test case, write in one line an integer number indicating the length of the longest constant
genome.
