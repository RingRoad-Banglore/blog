Fig : New Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg.

World Cup Cricket 2003 is now going on in
South Africa. The final will be held on 23rd
March in Johannesburg during the grand occa-
sion in Beverly Hills, California.

Many of you may not be interested in
cricket, but its really a passion in Indian sub-
continent. Ranking of cricketers is a common
pheonomenon there. Cricketers are ranked by
their performance in both form of cricket ( Test
and Oneday). People really enjoy this rank-
ing. They like to see their favourite players as
top ranked. They will not be happy if they
see Matthew Hayden as top ranked in stead of
Sachin Tendulkar or Rahul Dravid. Currently many such rankings are available. And as you have
probably guessed, each ranking makes a different player as top ranked.

World Cup committee has decided that they will make a new ranking on the performance of players
in the world cup. They want the ranking to be acceptable to the public. The rules are as follows:

 There are K different departments. Cricketers will be given points in each department depending
on their performance.

 The maximum points for each department are not euqal. Such as Saeed Anwar can get maximum
25 points in batting but Jonty Rhodes can get maximum 10 points for his spectacular fielding.

 The sum of maximum points of all departments will be exactly N points. And the final ranking
will depend on the total earned points out of N points.

The ranking committee wants popular cricketers get top ranked. To do so they even allow maximum
points for fielding more than that of batting. But that can bring lots of criticism. So they decide to
fix a range of points for each department. Such as maximum points for batting will be atleast 10 and
atmost 15 or for fielding, it will be atleast 8 and atmost 12. But the total points will be 20. Then 3
ranking system is possible, such as :

Batting Fielding
10 10
11 9
12 8

In this problem, you have to find out the number of ranking systems possible for given number of
departments, range of points for each department and total points.
