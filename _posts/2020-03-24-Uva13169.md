```
Joana Vasconcelos is a Portuguese artist who uses everyday ob-
jects in her creations, like electric irons or plastic cutlery. She is
an inspiration to Ana, who wants to make ceiling hanging sculp-
tures with straight knitting needles and balls of wool. For safety
reasons, there will be a ball at each end of each needle. Knitting
needles vary in colour, length and thickness (to allow intersections
of needles).

Sculptures are to be exhibited in room corners, which pro-
vide a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, with many lamps on the
ceiling. Sculpture designs are made with the coordinates of the
centres of the balls of wool in which knitting needles are stuck.
That is, each needle N is represented by a set of two different
triples: N = {(x, y, z), (x, y, z)}.

Ana dislikes closed chains. A true closed chain is a sequence
of k distinct needles, N1, N2, . . . , Nk (for some k  3), such that:

 N1 = {(x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)},

N2 = {(x2, y2, z2), (x3, y3, z3)}, . . . ,

Nk = {(xk, yk, zk), (xk+1, yk+1, zk+1)}, and

(xk+1, yk+1, zk+1) = (x1, y1, z1).

But her dislike of closed chains is so extreme that the shadow
of the sculpture on the floor has to be free of floor closed chains.
Given any needle N = {(x, y, z), (x, y, z)}, let N = {(x, y), (x, y)} denote the shadow of needle N
on the floor. For Ana (who is an artist), a floor closed chain is also a sequence of k distinct needles,
N1, N2, . . . , Nk (for some k  3), such that:

 Ni = N

j , for every 1  i < j  k (the k needle shadows are all distinct);

 N1 = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2)}, N

2 = {(x2, y2), (x3, y3)}, . . . ,

N

k = {(xk, yk), (xk+1, yk+1)}, and (xk+1, yk+1) = (x1, y1).

Consider the sculpture depicted in the figure, which has the following four knitting needles:

A = {(12, 12, 8), (10, 5, 11)}, B = {(12, 12, 8), (4, 14, 21)},

C = {(12, 12, 8), (12, 20, 8)}, D = {(4, 14, 21), (10, 5, 21)}.

This structure is not free of closed chains because, although there is no true closed chain, the sequence
of needles A,B,D is a floor closed chain.

Write a program that, given the knitting needles of a sculpture, determines whether there is a true
or a floor closed chain in the sculpture.

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of the input has one integer, K, which is the number of knitting needles in the
sculpture. Each of the following K lines contains six integers, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, and z2, which indicate
that {(x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)} is the set of triples of a needle. Any two distinct needles are represented
by different sets of triples.

Constraints
1  K  50 000 Number of knitting needles
1  xi, yi, zi < 1 000 Coordinates of each triple

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.

The output has two lines, each one with a string. The string in the first line is: True closed
chains, if there is some true closed chain in the sculpture; No true closed chains, otherwise. The
string in the second line is: Floor closed chains, if there is some floor closed chain in the sculpture;
No floor closed chains, otherwise.
