title: Uva 11995  I Can Guess the Data Structure
---


## Input

```
There is a bag-like data structure, supporting two operations:

1 x Throw an element x into the bag.
2 Take out an element from the bag.

Given a sequence of operations with return values, youre going to guess the data structure. It is
a stack (Last-In, First-Out), a queue (First-In, First-Out), a priority-queue (Always take out larger
elements first) or something else that you can hardly imagine!
```

## Output

```
There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n (1  n 
1000). Each of the next n lines is either a type-1 command, or an integer 2 followed by an integer x.
That means after executing a type-2 command, we get an element x without error. The value of x is
always a positive integer not larger than 100. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one of the following:

stack Its definitely a stack.
queue Its definitely a queue.
priority queue Its definitely a priority queue.
impossible It cant be a stack, a queue or a priority queue.
not sure It can be more than one of the three data structures

mentioned above.

```
