title: Uva 12607  Amazing Maze
---


## Input

```
Maze is a grid of M  N cells, each cell has 4 doors
that allow you to move into one of the neighbouring
cells. At any point of time only one of them is open.
Doors are one-way, meaning that if you can move
from cell A to B it does not necessarily mean that you
can move from B to A at the same point of time. The
initial arrangement of doors is given, after one unit
of time has passed the currently open door closes and
the one that is 90 degrees clockwise from it opens.

There are K treasure chests that you are supposed
to pick up and their coordinates are given. You can
only move from one cell to another if the correspond-
ing door is open. Moving from cell to cell takes one
unit of time, but you may have to wait for the specific
door to open.

You start at the top left corner (1,1), have to pick
up all treasure chests and exit the maze at the bottom
right square (M,N). You can enter the square (M,N) at any time, but will be able to exit only if you
collected all treasure chests. Exit does not mean that you have to get off the grid, just that
you are at (M,N) with all the treasures.

What is the minimum time you need to accomplish this task?
```

## Output

```
Several test cases, each begins with two integers on a line, M and N (2  M,N  100). M lines follow
with N characters, each of them one of N, E, S or W, indicating the side of the cell that is open at
time 0.

If we label a cell as (r, c), N, E, S or W allow movement to (r1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c), (r, c1)
respectively.

Next line contains the integer K (1  K  8), the number of cells containing treasure chests. K
lines follow with two integers R and C on each, denoting the coordinates of treasure chests. All K
locations will be distinct and none of them will be at (1, 1) or (M,N).

The last case is followed by the line containing two zeros.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case print the minimum time needed to exit the maze after collecting all treasure chests,
as described in the problem statement.
