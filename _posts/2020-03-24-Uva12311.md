title: Uva 12311  All-Pair Farthest Points
---


## Input

```text
Given a convex polygon in 2D space, youre to find out the farthest vertex for each vertex.
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 10 test cases in the input. Each test case begins with a single integer n (3 
n  30, 000), the number of points. Each of the following n lines contains two integers x, y (0  x, y 
100, 000, 000), the coordinates of the vertices, in counter-clockwise order. The last test case is followed
by a line with n = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print n lines, the farthest vertices for each vertex. The vertices in the input are
numbered 1 to n. If there are multiple farthest vertex, output the smallest index.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
0 0
1 0
0 10
0

```
