title: Uva 00137  Polygons
---


## Input

```text
Given two convex polygons, they may or may not overlap. If they do overlap, they will do so to differing
degrees and in different ways. Write a program that will read in the coordinates of the corners of two
convex polygons and calculate the exclusive or of the two areas, that is the area that is bounded by
exactly one of the polygons. The desired area is shaded in the following diagram:
```

## Output

```text
Input will consist of pairs of lines each containing the number of vertices of the polygon, followed by
that many pairs of integers representing the x,y coordinates of the corners in a clockwise direction. All
the coordinates will be positive integers less than 100. For each pair of polygons (pair of lines in the
data file), your program should print out the desired area correct to two decimal places. The input will
end with a line containing a zero (0).

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output will consist of a single line containing the desired area written as a succession of eight (8) digit
fields with two (2) digits after the decimal point. There will not be enough cases to need more than
one line.

Note: The symbol  in the Sample Output below represents a space.
