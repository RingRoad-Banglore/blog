title: Uva 13157  Prime Distance
---


## Input

```
You have an empty 1  n grid. The cells of the grid are indexed from 1 to n from left to right. You
have to put m identical coins in the grid. A cell can contain zero or more coins. If you pick a pair of
cells each containing at least one coin, the distance between the cells must be a prime number.

How many ways you can place the coins? As the number can be large, find answer modulo 109 +7.
Two ways are different if there is at least one cell which contains different number of coins.

The distance between two cells indexed i, j is |i j|.
```

## Output

```
The first line contains T (1  T  2000) (the number of test cases). Each of the next T lines contains
two integers n (1  n  105) and m (1  m  105) separated by a single space.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Hint:
In the first case, you can put both coins in cell 1, 2 or 3. Or you can put

a coin in cell 1 and put another coin in cell 3. See picture.

Note that in the 2nd case putting 3 coins in cell 1, 3, 5, is not valid,
because the distance between cell 5 and cell 1 is a non-prime.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
3 2
6 3

```
