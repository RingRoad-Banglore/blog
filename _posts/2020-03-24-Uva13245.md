## Input

```
We can not be anything without playing to be.

Jean-Paul Sartre

A dartboard manufacturer wants to revolutionize the
game of darts, creating a prime dartboard for math geeks.
He has designed several boards with different numbers of
areas, so that a board with n areas has the following scores:
the first area is worth 1 point, the remaining n  1 areas
have a value corresponding to the first n1 prime numbers.

For example, a prime dartboard with 20 areas could be
as in the picture on the right:

We want to know the minimum number of darts needed
to obtain a score of q points on a prime dartboard of size
n.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer, t, indicating
the number of prime dartboards.

For each case, there is a line with two numbers separated by a space. The first one, n, represents
the number of areas of the board, with 1  n  100, and the second number, q, indicates the score we
have to get, with 1  q  5000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output should consist of one line showing the minimum number of darts needed
to obtain a q points on a prime dartboard of size n.

```

## Sample Output

```
