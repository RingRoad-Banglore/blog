## Input

```text
Two neighboring countries named Fobos and Dimos are in trouble with their natural resources. All the
Gold mines are in Fobos and all the Coal mines are in Dimos and the Coal mines are always a good
source of Diamond. So whenever Fobos needs Diamond she has to buy it from Dimos and vice versa.
The peace loving Presidents (!) of these two countries meet to find out a way of sharing their resources
and they decide very quickly to draw an Inter Country Mine Line (ICML), which is a straight-line
that divides both the Gold mines and Coal mines equally. I mean if Fobos has 10 Gold mines and
Dimos has 16 Coal mines then there will be 5 (=10/2) Gold mines and 8 (=16/2) Coal mines on one
side of the ICML and the rest of the mines will be on the other side. Fobos will own the mines on
one side of the line and Dimos will own the mines on the other side. But unfortunately, the number of
both Gold mines and Coal mines are odd so they cannot be equally shared. Therefore, the Presidents
have also decided that one Gold mine and one Coal mine will be on the ICML and those two special
mines will be owned by both the countries. Now your job is two find these two special mines.

Figure: The figure above shows a typical scenario that is stated in this problem. There are total five
Gold mines and seven Coal mines. So when they are equally divided into two parts then both sides
have two Gold mines and three Coal mines. The ICML passes through the other Gold and Coal

mine. If the total number of each type of mines is odd and no three mines are on the same line then
ICML is always unique. The goal of this problem is to find the two mines that are on the ICML.

## Output

```text
The input fine contains maximum 20 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with an even integer N (0 < N  10000), which indicates how many mines are there
in this case. Each of the next N lines contains two floating-point numbers x and y (0 < |x|, |y| < 10000)
and (|x|  1.0), which indicates the location of a mine in Cartesian coordinate system. The mines on
the left side of y-axis (negative x coordinate) are Gold mines and the mines on the right side of y-axis
(positive x coordinate) are Coal mines. The identifier for each mine is in the order they appear in
the input, starting from zero. But the identifier series for Gold and Coal mines are different. So the
first Gold mine in the input file has serial 0, the second Gold Mine has serial 1 and similarly the first



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10797  Peaceful Sharing 2/2

Coal mine in the input has serial 0, the second Coal mine has serial 1 etc. You can assume that no
three mines are on the same line and no two mines are in the same place as mines are always naturally
distributed.

Input is terminated by a case where the value of N is zero. This case should not be processed.

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by two
integers g and c, where g is serial of the Gold mine that is on the ICML and c is the serial of the Coal
mine that is on the ICML.

Look at the output for sample input for details.
