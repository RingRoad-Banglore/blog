```

In a large organization, everyone knows a lot of colleagues. However, friendship relations are kept with
only a few of them, to whom news are told.

Suppose that whenever an employee knows of a piece of news, he tells it to all his friends on the
following day. So, on the first day, the source of the information tells it to his friends; on the second
day, the sources friends tell it to their friends; on the third day, the friends of the sources friends tell
it to their friends; and so on.

The goal is to determine:

 the maximum daily boom size, which is the largest number of employees that, on a single day,
hear the piece of news for the first time; and

 the first boom day, which is the first day on which the maximum daily boom size occurs.

Write a program that, given the friendship relations between the employees and the source of a piece
of news, computes the maximum daily boom size and the first boom day of that information spreading
process.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains the number E of employees (1  E  2500). Employees are
numbered from 0 to E  1.

Each of the following E lines specifies the set of friends of an employees (from employee 0 to
employee E  1). A set of friends contains the number of friends N (0  N < 15), followed by N
distinct integers representing the employees friends. All integers are separated by a single space.

The next line contains an integer T (1  T < 60), which is the number of test cases.
Each of the following T lines contains an employee, which represents the (unique) source of the piece

of news in the test case.

```

## Output

```
The output consists of T lines, one for each test case.

If no employee (but the source) hears the piece of news, the output line contains the integer 0.

Otherwise, the output line contains two integers, M and D, separated by a single space, where M
is the maximum daily boom size and D is the first boom day.
