## Input

```
Cao Cao made up a big army and was going to invade the whole South China. Yu Zhou was worried
about it. He thought the only way to beat Cao Cao is to have a spy in Cao Caos army. But all generals
and soldiers of Cao Cao were loyal, its impossible to convince any of them to betray Cao Cao.

So there is only one way left for Yu Zhou, send someone to fake surrender Cao Cao. Gai Huang was
selected for this important mission. However, Cao Cao was not easy to believe others, so Gai Huang
must leak some important information to Cao Cao before surrendering.

Yu Zhou discussed with Gai Huang and worked out N information to be leaked, in happening order.
Each of the information was estimated to has ai value in Cao Caos opinion.

Actually, if you leak information with strict increasing value could accelerate making Cao Cao believe
you. So Gai Huang decided to leak exact M information with strict increasing value in happening order.
In other words, Gai Huang will not change the order of the N information and just select M of them.
Find out how many ways Gai Huang could do this.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T (1  100). T test cases follow.

Each test case begins with two numbers N (1  N  103) and M (1  M  N), indicating the
number of information and number of information Gai Huang will select. Then N numbers in a line,
the i-th number ai (1  ai  109) indicates the value in Cao Caos opinion of the i-th information in
happening order.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting
from 1) and y is the ways Gai Huang can select the information.

The result is too large, and you need to output the result mod by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Note:
In the first case, Gai Huang need to leak 2 information out of 3. He could leak any 2 information

as all the information value are in increasing order.
In the second case, Gai Huang has no choice as selecting any 2 information is not in increasing

order.
