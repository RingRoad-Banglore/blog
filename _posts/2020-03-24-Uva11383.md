title: Uva 11383  Golden Tiger Claw
---


```
Omi, Raymondo, Clay and Kimiko are on new adventure- in search of new Shen Gong Wu. But Evil
Boy Genius Jack Spicer is also there. Omi and Jack found the Shen Gong Wu at the same time so they
rushed for it but alas they touched it at the same time. Then what? It is time for Xiaolin Showdown.

Jack challenged Omi to play a game. The game is simple! There will be an N  N board where
each cell in the board contains some number. They have to assign numbers to each row and column
separately so that w(i, j)  row(i) + col(j) where w(i, j) is the number assigned to the cell located
at i-th row and j-th column, row(i) is the number assigned to i-th row and col(j) is the number
assigned to j-th column. That is simple isnt it? Well . . . the main part is that you have to minimize

1in(row(i) + col(j)).

Jack has taken his favorite Monkey Stuff and Omi has taken Golden Tiger Claw. With the help
of this Golden Tiger Claw, he can go anywhere in the world. He has come to you and seeking your
help. Jack is using his computer to solve this problem. So do it quick! Find the most optimal solution
for Omi so that you can also be part of history in saving the world from the darkness of evil.
