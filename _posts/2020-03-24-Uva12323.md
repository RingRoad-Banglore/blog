title: Uva 12323  Inspecting Radars
---


## Input

```text
Radars Inc. is a worldwide renowned radar maker, whose excellent reputation lies on strict quality
assurance procedures and a large variety of radar models that fit all budgets. The company hired you
to develop a detailed inspection that consists of a sequence of E experiments on a specific surveillance
model.

There is a field represented with a polar coordinate plane that contains N objects placed at positions
with integer polar coordinates. The inspected model is located at the origin (0, 0) of the field and
can detect objects at a distance less than its detection range R through a scan area defined by four
adjustment parameters , A, h, and H, whose meaning is illustrated with the following figure:

Formally, the scan area of the model is the region described by the set of polar points

{(r, )| h  r < h+H,     +A}

, A, h and H are four integer values where:

  specifies the start angle of the radars scan area (0   < 360);

 A specifies the opening angle of the radars scan area (0  A < 360);

 h gives the internal radius of the radars scan area (0  h < R); and

 H gives the height of the radars scan area (1  H  R).

An object placed at (r, ) will be displayed by the model if h  r < h+H and     +A, where
the last inequality should be understood modulo 360o (i.e., adding and comparing angles in a circle).

Given N objects placed on the field, you must develop an inspection of the surveillance model
through the implementation of E experiments with specific parameterizations. For each experiment
you have to find the maximal number of objects on the field that the radar should display if the
parameters  (0   < 360) and h (0  h < R) are free to set (as integer numbers), and the parameters
H (1  H  R) and A (0  A < 360) are given.

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is described as follows:

 A line with two integer numbers N and R separated by blanks, representing (respectively) the
number of objects located on the field and the detection range of the model (1  N  104,
2  R  102).

 Each one of the following N lines contains two integer numbers ri and i separated by blanks,
specifying the integer polar coordinates (ri, i) of the i-th object (1  ri < R, 0  i < 360,
1  i  N).

 The next line has an integer number E indicating the number of experiments of the inspection
(1  E  102).

 Each one of the following E lines contains two integer numbers Hj and Aj separated by blanks,
representing (respectively) the fixed height and the fixed opening angle that parameterize the j-th
experiment (1  Hj  R, 0  Aj < 360, 1  j  E).

For each test case you can suppose that there are not two different objects placed at the same integer
polar coordinate. The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case of the input, print E lines where the j-th line contains the maximal number of
objects on the field that the radar should display according to the parameterization given for the j-th
experiment (1  j  E).
