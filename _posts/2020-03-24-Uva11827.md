## Input

```
Given the N integers, you have to find the maximum GCD (greatest common divisor) of every possible
pair of these integers.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input is an integer N (1 < N < 100) that determines the number of test cases.

The following N lines are the N test cases. Each test case contains M (1 < M < 100) positive
integers that you have to find the maximum of GCD.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case show the maximum GCD of every possible pair.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
10 20 30 40
7 5 12
125 15 25

```
