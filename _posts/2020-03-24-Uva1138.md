title: Uva 01138  Roof

## Input

```
Contemporary buildings can have very complicated roofs. If we take a vertical section of such a roof it
amounts to a number of sloping segments. When it is raining the drops are falling down onto the roof
straight from the sky above. Some segments are completely exposed to the rain but there may be some
segments partially or even completely shielded by other segments. All the water falling onto a segment
flows as a stream straight down from the lower end of the segment on the ground or possibly onto some
other segment. In particular if a stream of water is falling on an end of a segment then we consider it
to be collected by this segment.

For the purpose of designing a piping system it is desired to compute how much water is flowing
down from each segment of the roof. To be prepared for a heavy November rain you should count one
liter of rain water falling on a meter of the horizontal plane during one second.

Write a program that:

 reads the description of the roof from the standard input,

 computes the amount of water flowing down in one second from each segment of the roof,

 writes the result to the standard output.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several test cases separated by a blank line. The first line of the input indicates the
number of test cases, and its followed by a blank line.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1138  Roof 2/2

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1  n  40000) being the number of segments
of the roof. Each of the next n lines describes one segment of the roof and contains four integers x1,
y1, x2, y2 (0  x1, y1, x2, y2  1000000, x1 < x2, y1 = y2) separated by single spaces. Integers x1, y1
are respectively the horizontal position and the height of the left end of the segment. Integers x2, y2
are respectively the horizontal position and the height of the right end of the segment. The segments
dont have common points and there are no horizontal segments. Also you can assume that there are
at most 100 segments placed above any point on the ground level.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output consists of n lines. The i-th line should contain the amount of water (in
liters) flowing down from the i-th segment of the roof during one second.

The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
