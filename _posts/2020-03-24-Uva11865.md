title: Uva 11865  Stream My Contest
---


## Input

```text
During 2009 and 2010 ICPC world finals, the contest was webcasted via world wide web. Seeing this,
some contest organizers from Ajobdesh decided that, they will provide a live stream of their contests to
every university in Ajobdesh. The organizers have decided that, they will provide best possible service
to them. But there are two problems:

1. There is no existing network between universities. So, they need to build a new network. However,
the maximum amount they can spend on building the network is C.

2. Each link in the network has a bandwidth. If, the streams bandwidth exceeds any of the links
available bandwidth, the viewers, connected through that link cant view the stream.

Due to the protocols used for streaming, a viewer can receive stream from exactly one other user
(or the server, where the contest is organized). That is, if you have two 128kbps links, you wont get
256kbps bandwidth, although, if you have a stream of 128kbps, you can stream to any number of users
at that bandwidth.

Given C, you have to maximize the minimum bandwidth to any user.
```

## Output

```text
First line of input contains T ( 50), the number of test cases. This is followed by T test cases.

Each test case starts with an integer N , M , C (1  N  60, 1  M  104, 1  C  109), the
number of universities and the number of possible links, and the budget for setting up the network.
Each university is identified by an integer between 0 and N  1, where 0 is the server.

Next M lines each contain 4 integers, u, v, b, c (0  u, v < N , 1  b, c  106, u = v), describing
a possible link from university u to university v, that has the bandwidth of b kbps and of cost c. All
links are unidirectional.

There is a blank line before each test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the maximum bandwidth to stream.

If its not possible, output streaming not possible..
