Figure 3: Regular octahedron

Carl the ant is back! When we last left him
(Problem A, 2004 World Finals), Carl was a
little mixed-up, always taking strange, zigzag
paths when traveling. But now, Carl has
straightened out his life - literally. He now
always takes the straightest, shortest path be-
tween any pair of points. This sounds simple,
except for one small thing: Carl now spends
most of his time on a paperweight in the shape
of a regular octahedron. You may recall that an
octahedron is one of the five Platonic solids and
consists of eight equilateral triangles, as shown
in Figure 3.

Carl has an innate (some say in-ant) abil-
ity to always take the shortest path when going
from any starting point to any destination point
on the paperweight. Your job is to verify this
by determining the length of the shortest path
when given two such points, not necessarily dis-
tinct.
```

## Input

```
The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four integers 1, 1, 2 and 2,
where 0  i < 360 and 0  i  180. The first two are the spherical coordinates of the start point,
and the last two are the spherical coordinates of the destination point. As shown in Figure 3, i is the
azimuth and i is the zenith angle, both of them given in degrees.

The input is terminated by a line containing four negative ones.
The paperweight is fixed for all test cases as follows: the octahedron is centered on the origin and

each vertex lies on one of the axes. Every edge is exactly 10 cm long. You should suppose that Carls
size is zero and ignore any supporting mechanisms that may be necessary to hold the paperweight in
the correct position.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number (starting with 1) and the length in centimeters of the shortest
path from the start point to the destination point, rounded to the nearest thousandth. Follow the
format of the sample output.
