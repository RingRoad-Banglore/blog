## Input

```
Portuguese is one of the most beautiful languages in the whole world, but almost everyone who speaks
Portuguese is either brazilian or portuguese. Since people all around the world (and not just brazilians)
are participating in this contest, we would like to help you to begin learning portuguese with this
problem. Well, the program youll write will help you (if its correct).

All you must to do is to write a conjugator, that is, a program that conjugates verbs. In English
theres not much to do when the verb is regular (it follows some model). But in Portuguese its a
bit different. But dont worry, well explain all you need to know in order to learn how to conjugate
regular portuguese verbs.

First of all, lets learn the pronouns, which youll use to conjugate the verbs:
English Portuguese
I Eu
You Tu
He/She Ele/Ela
We Ns
You Vs
They Eles/Elas

The  character is represented by ASCII code 243. It doesnt matter how it looks on your screen,
use ASCII character 243 when writing ns and vs! In Portuguese, all verbs in the infinitive mode
have one of these sufixes: ar (first conjugations), er (second conjugation) and ir (third conjugation).
For instance, amar (to love) is from the first conjugation, whereas correr (to run) is from the second,
and partir (to go away) is from the third. So, you can recognize from which conjugations is the verb
by its sufix (of course there are some exceptions to this rules, but were not going to handle them).

We call root the verb in the infinitive mode without the sufix (so, for these three verbs we just
saw, we have am, corr and part as roots). We call the thematic vowel (tv for short) the
vowel of the sufix (i.e. a, e or i).

To conjugate regular verbs, all you have to do is to find out from which conjugations is the verb and,
then, follow the model for that conjugation. In this problem we are only interested in the presente
tense, so here are the models for all conjugations on the presente tense:

Pronoun 1st Conjugation 2nd Conjugation 3rd Conjugation
Eu root + o root + o root + o
Tu root + tv + s root + tv + s root + es
Ele/Ela root + tv root + tv root + e
Ns root + tv + mos root + tv + mos root + tv + mos
Vs root + tv + is root + tv + is root + tv + s
Eles/Elas root + tv + m root + tv + m root + em

Lets see, as an example, the conjugation of the three verbs above:
Pronoun amar correr partir
Eu amo corro parto
Tu amas corres partes
Ele/Ela ama corre parte
Ns amamos corremos partimos
Vs amais correis partis
Eles/Elas amam correm partem

So, your task is: given a verb in Portuguese (and its meaning in English), conjugate the verb.
```

## Output

```
There will be two words per line, v1 and v2. The first one (v1) is the verb in Portuguese, and the second
one (v2) is its meaning in English. All words will be formed by just latin lowercase letters (i.e. all
letters will lie in the range [a..z]). No word will have more than 30 characters. You must read until
you reach the end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each pair of words, the first line of output must be:

v1 (to v2)

Where v1 stands for the verb in Portuguese and v2 its meaning in English (as described above).
After that, you must print 6 lines with the correct conjugation, assuming the verb will be regular. The
first character of the pronoun must start at the first column of the line. The equivalent conjugation
to that pronoun must begin at column 11 of the same line. The space between the pronoun and the
conjugation must be filled with blanks. If the verb read lies in none of the conjugations given, instead
of the conjugation, just print the line

Unknown conjugation

You must print a blank line between the output sets.

```

## Sample Output

```
falar talk
compor compose
andar walk

```
