## Input

```
You want to give a special gift to your special friend on a special occasion in a very special box! So
you have bought some special ribbons and you want to wrap the gift box in a special way. Instead of
wrapping it in a traditional way, that is ribbons crossing through the middle of the box parallel to the
edges, you are wrapping it in a way that the ribbon makes a complete loop around the box creating
two parallel pieces of ribbons on the top and on the bottom of the box (see picture below). The ribbon
crosses every face once, except the top and bottom, which it crosses twice. The ribbon rests tightly
against the box all the way round because the angle at which it meets an edge is continued onto the
next face.

In the above picture, the ribbon is running through I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P points. JK and ON are the
parallel pieces on the top while IP and LM are the parallel pieces on the bottom.

If you are given the length, width and height of the box, can you find the length of the ribbon?
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T (1  T  1000), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of
three integers, L, W and H, denoting the length, width and height of the box respectively. You can
assume that 1  L,W,H  1000. Lengths are given in centimeters.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, first print the case number starting from 1 as shown in sample input and output
section, then print the length of the ribbon in centimeters rounded off to 4 decimal places. Floating
point error lower than 103 will be ignored by the judge. Check sample input and output for details.
