title: Uva 01730  Sum of MSLCM
---


## Input

```text
A positive integer N can be the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of different set of numbers. For
example, LCM(6, 24) = 24, LCM(12, 8) = 24, LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 8) = 24, etc. For a given number N ,
maximum sum LCM indicates the set of numbers whose LCM is N and summation is maximum. Let,
MSLCM(N) denote this maximum sum of numbers. Given the value of N you will have to find the
value:

N
i=2

MSLCM(i)

Obviously, in a set the same value never comes twice.
```

## Output

```text
Input file contains at most 200 lines. Each line contains a positive integer which denotes the value of
N (1 < N < 20000001). Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero, which should not be
processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each positive number N in the input, produce one line of output. This line contains an integer
which denotes the value Ni=2MSLCM(i)

```

## Sample Output

```text
10
1000
0

```
