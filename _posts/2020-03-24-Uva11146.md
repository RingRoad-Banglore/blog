title: Uva 11146  Insurrection
---


## Input

```text
It is 8282 AD and the Bizz and the Pezz are two allied kings in the Far Far Away island, which consists
of many territories some of them connected to each other with some roads. Recently, they found that a
group of criminals under leadership of MijIT Dozddar want to begin two simultaneous insurrections in
their territories. Therefore, they tried to recognize these criminals, but they did not succeed. Now, they
have another plan for preventing the insurrections. They know the criminals must be in contact for
simultaneous insurrections and by preventing them contact each other, they can prevent insurrection.
In addition, they know their soldiers can identify these criminal outside of their territories. So, by
building a tower in another territory (a territory except than Bizzs or Pezzs territory), soldiers of this
tower can recognize criminals and the criminals cannot pass this territory to contact. To convince the
king of a territory for building a tower in his territory, both of them must send one carrier with one
letter to her/him to request for construction permission of the tower. Also, the carrier of this letter
must not enter a territory more than once since the criminals may catch her/him. In addition, the
carrier of the letter must pay some money in some territories when he enters them and he earns some
money when he enters some other territories under indirect control of Bizz or Pezz. Of course, since the
territories under control of Bizz or Pezz are few, the money carrier earns is always less than or equal
to the money he must pay. It should be noted that if one starts from a territory, visits some other
territories and goes back to the first territory, he does not have more money than before starting the
trip. Now, Bizz and Pezz need your help to select some territories for building some towers such that
the criminals of their territories could not contact each other and the total money required for sending
the letters to these territories be minimum.

## Output

```text
The input begins with a positive integer T showing the number of test cases and then, T test cases
follow. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers 2  n  50 and 0  m  300 showing
the number of territories and roads between them respectively. Bizz is in territory 1 and Pezz is in
territory n. After that, a line with n  2 real numbers come where the ith one shows the amount
of money the carrier must pay in the territory i + 1 (which can be negative if the territory is under
indirect control of Bizz or Pezz). Then, m lines come containing two integer between 1 and n describing
endpoints of a road. There is a blank line after each test case.
