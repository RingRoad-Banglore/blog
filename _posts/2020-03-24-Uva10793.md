title: Uva 10793  The Orc Attack
---


## Input

```text
Gardal Grimsight, the hero of the Orc horde, is planning a massive attack on the
human stronghold. But to overcome the stiff resistance of the humans, Grimsight
would need an army of mammoth size. Realizing this, he wastes no time  all his
five buildings start to produce units on his command. The Altar of Storms, the
Barracks, the Beastiary, the Spirit Lodge and the Tauren Totem  these are his
five unit producing buildings. These buildings are strategically placed in different
locations but can have a rally point where the units are sent as soon as they are
produced. This gives Grimsight a good coverage of the territory as well as the
flexibility of unit movement.

Now before Grimsight wages the war, the units
produced need to meet at this rally point in the map.
This point should be chosen in a way that the short-
est distance from the five unit producing buildings
to this location is equal. If there are multiple such
spots, the units would gather in a place from where
the shortest distance to the farthest point in the map
is the minimum. Your task is to help the belligerent
hero in determining this minimum shortest distance
of the farthest point.

However, a small problem remains. The shortest
distance between two points in the map is not neces-
sarily the straight line distance between them. Trees,
hills and water sheds can act as obstacle for the free
movement of the units. So the units may need to go
through different locations to get to the point where
they are intended to go. If the distances between all

these locations in the map are given, then it is possible to compute the shortest distance traveled by the
units. The rally point is one such location in the map that we need to find. To keep it simple, we can
treat the buildings as locations in the map as well. You may be relieved to know that in Grimsights
world all the units move from one location to another in the shortest possible ways only.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10793  The Orc Attack 2/2

Here is a sample scenario. The locations 1 through 5 are the five unit
producing buildings. Apart from those, there are five more locations in
the map. As we can see, the locations 9 and 7 are equidistant from the
five unit producing buildings. So they are the candidates for the rally
point. But we would choose location 9 over location 7 as the farthest
location from 7 has a cost of 51 whereas the farthest location from 9
would incur a cost of 40. So the cost that Grimsight wants to measure
is this distance cost 40.

Please note that the sample input/output section does not include
the example shown here.

## Output

```text
There can be multiple test cases. The first line of input gives you the number of test cases, T (1 
T  20). Then T test cases follow. The first line of each input gives you the number of locations, L
(5 < L  100), followed by the number of distance information between the locations, D (1  D 
1000). Each of the next D lines would contain three integers U (1  U  L), V (1  V  L) and C
(1  C  1000) indicating a distance of cost C between the locations U and V . There may be multiple
occurrences of the same U , V pair in the input  it is up to you to decide which one to use. You should
remember that a unit does not need to cover any distance if it remains static. We would consider the
locations 1 through 5 to be the five buildings of our interest.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each of the test case, you need to print one line of output. The output for each test case should
start with the serial number of the map, followed by the minimum possible distance from the farthest
point. This distance, as we have already mentioned, has to be measured from the rally point which is
equidistant from the five buildings. It is implied that all the locations in the map should be reachable
from this point. When such a point does not exist you should print a -1 instead.
