```
At the end of the Middle Ages, quite a few universities throughout Europe have already been founded.
The new term has just begun, so there are a lot of freshmen around. Not everyone has been lucky to
be admitted to her/his desired university. As a result, many couples are now living in separate towns.

Of course, they try to see each other as often as they can. To facilitate this, the students have
negotiated a deal with the coachmen. Instead of paying the regular price for a ride from one town
to another, the price is determined by drawing a random integer between 1 and R inclusive, all num-
bers being equally likely. Unfortunately, this process repeats itself a few times whenever there is no
direct connection between the towns a couple lives in. That makes the total cost of a journey quite
unpredictable.

Help the couples determine the probability that one of them can afford a one-way trip to the other
one. Given the number of towns and a list of direct connections, your program is supposed to process a
list of couples. For each couple, you know their budget and where they live. Of course, they will always
choose a route with the least expected price. Such a route exists between any two towns.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of test cases that follow.

Each test case begins with a line that holds the number N of towns (1  N  100) followed by the
maximum price R of a single ticket (1  R  30). The following N lines contain N characters each.
The j-th character in the i-th line of these is Y if there is a direct connection between towns i and j,
but N otherwise. The j-th character in the i-th line is always the same as the the i-th character in
the j-th line. The j-th character in the j-th line is always N.

Each test case goes on with the number C of couples on a line by itself (1  C  1000). Then for
each couple there is a line that holds three integers a, b, and m. These numbers state that one of them
lives in town a, the other one in town b (1  a, b  N, a = b), and the amount of money they can spend
is m (1  m  10000).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print one line containing the word Case, a single space, and its serial number
(starting with 1 for the first test case). Then, output one line for each couple in this test case containing
the probability that they can afford a one-way journey according to the rules above. Your answer is
allowed to differ from the exact result by at most 0.001. Print a blank line after each test case.
