title: Uva 10760  Translation or Rotation
---


## Input

```
A line segment is given in the plane by its endpoints a = (ax, ay) and b = (bx, by), where a is not equal
to b. The segment has been moved either by a counterclockwise rotation around some point or by a
translation and the final coordinates of its endpoints are known a = (ax, ay) and b = (bx, by), where
endpoint a corresponds to the original endpoint a, and b to b. Your task is to decide whether the
segment was rotated or translated and to report your findings.
```

## Output

```
Your program should read input from standard. Each line of the input contains 8 floating-point num-
bers, separated by spaces and giving the values of ax, ay, ax, ay, bx, by, bx, by. A line containing 8 zeros
terminates the input and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output in the format given in the sample, where floating-
point numbers are printed to 1 digits of the fractional part. The reported angle of rotation should be
nonnegative and smaller than 360. In your computations, two floating-point numbers differing by less
than 10e8 should be considered equal. Note that when the segment has not changed its position then
report No move.
