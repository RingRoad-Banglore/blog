```
A common problem when processing incoming text is to isolate the words in the text. This is made
more difficult by the punctuation; words have commas, quote marks, (even brackets) next to them,
or hy-phens in the middle of the word. This punctuation doesnt count as letters when the words have
to be looked up in a dictionary by the program.

For this problem, you must separate out clean words from text, that is, words with no attached or
embedded non-letters. A word is any continuous string of non-whitespace characters, with whitespace
characters on each side of it. For this problem, a whitespace character is a space character or an
end-of-line character, or the start or end of the file (so that, for example, if the input file consists of
Anne Bob, where there is a space character between the A and B but no other, then there are two
words, Anne and Bob).
```

## Input

```
Input will consist of lines with no more than 60 characters in each line. Every line will be terminated
by a character which isnt whitespace (which will be followed immediately by an end-of-line character).
The input will be terminated by a line consisting of a single #.

```

## Output

```
Output must be the lines of the incoming text, with the non-letters stripped away from each word. A
non-letter is any character which is not a letter (a - z and A - Z) and not a whitespace character. Your
program must not change the letters and space characters (although space characters at the ends of
lines will be ignored by the judges). When a non-letter occurs in the middle of a word (ie there is no
whitespace character next to it), it must be simply removed (see what happens to the word doesn't
in the example). A word which consists entirely of non-letters will therefore be removed entirely.

There is a special rule for a hyphen (-) when it is the very last character in a line:

 the word part before the hyphen and the first word part on the next line form a single word;

 this complete word must be written on a line by itself;

 you can assume that there will always be a space before the word part on the first line, and a
space after the word part on the second line.

```

## Sample Input

```
A common problem when processing incoming text is to isolate
the words in the text. This is made more difficult by the
punctuation; words have commas, "quote marks",
(even brackets) next to them, or hy-
phens in the middle of the word. This punctuation doesn't
count as letters when the words have to be looked up in a
# dictionary by the 12345 "**&! program.
