The Original
Chinese Rings Puzzle

The classic Chinese Rings puzzle comes in a variety of forms. The orig-
inal version has seven rings linked together by a sliding loop threaded
through them. The aim is to remove the loop by manipulating the rings
(see right).

A modern implementation uses seven disks with specially shaped
cut-outs mounted on a slide. The slide can move left and right. The
slide can always move left until it reaches its left-most position, shown
here:

Each disk can be rotated 90o, so the long end of the black bar points
either straight up (vertical) or to the left (horizontal). The slide can
only move right until a vertical disk hits the end stop under the Win
marking:

A disk can be rotated between horizontal and vertical only if it is positioned over the indentation
marked 0 and the disk on its right is vertical . The right-most disk can always rotate if it is in position
0 since it has no disk on its right.

The aim is to free the slide by moving it so its left edge aligns with the Win mark:

Your task is to write a program which will take several part-solved puzzles and compute the number
of steps needed to move the slide to position Win for each puzzle.

## Output

```text
There will be several puzzles in the input file. The first line of the file will contain an integer n specifying
the number of puzzles. There will then be n lines, each of the form:

length orientations position

where length is an integer indicating the number of disks on the slide, orientations is a string of length
characters from the set {h,v} giving the orientation of each disk from left to right, and position is an
integer from 0 to length specifying the numbered mark which aligns with the left edge of the slide.

## Sample Input

```text
For each puzzle, your program should output one integer on a line which counts the minimum number
of steps needed to win the puzzle. A step is either a movement of the slide, one unit left or right, or
the rotation of a disk.
