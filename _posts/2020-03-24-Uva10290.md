---


```
All the positive numbers can be expressed as a sum of one, two or more consecutive positive integers.
For example 9 can be expressed in three such ways, 2+3+4, 4+5 or 9. Given an integer less than
(91014+1) or (9E14 + 1) you will have to determine in how many ways that number can be expressed
as summation of consecutive numbers.
```
