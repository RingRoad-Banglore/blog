title: Uva 00332  Rational Numbers from Repeating Fractions
---


```
A rational number is any which can be written in the form p/q, where p and q are integers. All rational
numbers less than 1 (that is, those for which p is less than q) can be expanded into a decimal fraction,
but this expansion may require repetition of some number of trailing digits. For example, the rational
number 7/22 has the decimal expansion .3181818... (note that the pair of digits 1 and 8 repeat ad
infinitum). Numbers with such repeating decimal expansions are usually written with a horizontal bar
over the repeated digits, like this: .318

If we are given the decimal expansion of a rational fraction (with an indication of which digits are
repeated, if necessary), we can determine the rational fraction (that is, the integer values of p and q in
p/q) using the following algorithm.

Assume there are k digits immediately after the decimal point that are not repeated, followed by
a group of j digits which must be repeated. Thus for 7/22 we would have k = 1 (for the digit 3) and
j = 2 (for the digits 1 and 8). Now if we let X be the original number (7/22), we can compute the
numerator and denominator of the expression

10k+j X  10k X
10k+j  10k

For .318 we obtain the following calculation for the numerator of this fraction:

103  .318 101  .318 = 318.18 3.18 = 315

The denominator is just 1000  10, or 990. It is important to note that the expression in the
numerator and the denominator of this expression will always yield integer values, and these represent
the numerator and denominator of the rational number. Thus the repeated fraction .318 is the decimal
expansion of the rational number 315/990. Properly reduced, this fraction is (as expected) just 7/22.

## Input

```
The input data for this problem will be a sequence of test cases, each test case appearing on a line
by itself, followed by a -1. Each test case will begin with an integer giving the value of j, one or
more spaces, then the decimal expansion of a fraction given in the form 0.ddddd (where d represents
a decimal digit). There may be as many as nine (9) digits in the decimal expansion (that is, the value
of k + j may be as large as 9).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, display the case number (they are numbered sequentially starting with 1) and the
resulting rational number in the form p/q, properly reduced.
