## Input

```text
Consider an integer sequence consisting of N elements, where:

X0 = A

Xi = ((Xi1 B + C)%M) + 1 for i = 1 to N  1

You will be given the values of A, B, C, M and N . Find out the number of consecutive subsequences
whose sum is a multiple of M .

Consider an example where A = 2, B = 1, C = 2, M = 4 and N = 4.
So, X0 = 2, X1 = 1, X2 = 4 and X3 = 3.
The consecutive subsequences are {2}, {2 1}, {2 1 4}, {2 1 4 3}, {1}, {1 4}, {1 4 3}, {4}, {4 3} and

{3}.
Of these 10 consecutive subsequences, only two of them adds up to a figure that is a multiple of 4

 {1 4 3} and {4}.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 500) that indicates the number of test cases. Eact case
consists of 5 integers A, B, C, M and N . A, B and C will be non-negative integers not greater than
1000. N and M will be a positive integers not greater than 10000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output the case number followed by the result.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
2 1 2 4 4
923 278 195 8685 793
