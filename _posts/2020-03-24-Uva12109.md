title: Uva 12109  Fairies Defence
---


## Input

```
There are n fairies living happily in the Fairyland. One day, when the fairies are playing games, they are
suddenly stuck in the sky and cannot move anymore! Your moving abilities are sealed by my magic.
Be ready to defense my attack! a terrible voice came out, Ill appear in the cube (0, 0, 0)-(a, b, c),
rush to the nearest fairy and then, make my assault with all my power!

Since all the fairies cannot move any more, the only chance is to redistribute their defense powers
according to their dangerousness. Formally, the defense power one fairy gains should be proportional
to its probability to be attacked by the unknown fierce creature.

Write a program to compute the probability to be attacked, for every fairy. You may assume that
the probability density of the attackers initial position is the same everywhere in the cube; if there are
at least two fairies closest (having the minimal Euclidean distance) to the initial position, any one may
be attacked.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains four integers, n, a, b, c
(2  n  20, 1  a, b, c  1000). This is followed by n lines, each containing three integers x, y, z
(0  x  a, 0  y  b, 0  z  c), the coordinates of the fairies. No two fairies occupy the same
position. The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the probabilities for every fairy, to three decimal places.

## Sample Output

```

2 2 2
2 7 2 10
