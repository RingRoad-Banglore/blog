title: Uva 11674  In-Ellipse
---


## Input

```text
An in-ellipse of a triangle is an ellipse which touches all the sides of the triangle internally. In the figure
below you can see a triangle ABC and one of its axis parallel in-ellipse.

Given the coordinate of vertices of a triangle, your job is to find that axis parallel in-ellipse. Note
that any axis-parallel in-ellipse can be expressed uniquely with an equation of the following form:

(x h)2

a2
+

(y  k)2

b2
= 1

Here (h, k) is the center of the ellipse (Intersection point of major and minor axis) and 2a is the
length of the major axis and 2b is the length of the minor axis. So an axis-parallel ellipse can be
uniquely described with four parameters h, k, a and b. For this problem b can be greater than a.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 10001 lines of inputs. Each line contains seven floating-point numbers
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, El_A. The first six floating-point numbers denote that the three vertices of the
triangle in counter-clockwise order are (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3). The seventh floating-point number
El_A denotes the the area of in-ellipse of this triangle. Note that (0  x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3  5000) and
(0 < El_A < 1000000). Input is terminated by a line where the given area of the in-ellipse is negative.
This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains four floating-point numbers. These
numbers denote the value of h, k, a and b of the desired (Axis parallel in-ellipse of the given triangle
and having area El_A) ellipse. All these floating-point numbers should have ten (10) digits after the
decimal point. For every input there will be a solution. If there is more than one solution, any one will
be accepted. There is an special judge to ignore small precision errors. Also the value of a/b should be
within 0.1 and 10 to not allow ellipses that are almost straight line.
