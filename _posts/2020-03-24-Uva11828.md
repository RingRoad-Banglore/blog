title: Uva 11828  Palindrome Again
---


```
You are given a string S of length N . Can you find a string P which satisfies the following conditions?

1. Length of P will be N

2. Distance between S and P will be less than or equal to K

3. P will be a palindrome.

4. P can contain only characters a, b, , z

You have to calculate, in how many ways you can choose P . This number can be very large, so
print the answer modulo 1000000000 (109).
Notes:

-

 A string is a sequence of characters. For this problem consider that all strings can contain only
a, b, , z, i.e. 26 available characters.

 The length of the string is defined by the number of characters in the string. For example, length
of abcba is 5.

 A string is called palindrome when it is the same string when written from forwards or backwards.
For example  abcba, abba, a are palindrome but abc is not a palindrome.

 Distance between two string of same length is the number of mismatches of corresponding char-
acters. For example, distance between abcb and bcba is 4 because no character of first string
matches to the character of the corresponding index of second string, but distance between abc
and cba is 2.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T (T is around 5000), the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. First line contains two integers N (1  N  1000) and K
(0  K  1000). Second line contains a string S of length N . S contains only characters from a, b,
, z.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output the number of test cases followed by the number of ways the string can be
chosen modulo 1000000000 (109). See sample output for exact format.
