527 The partition of a cake
There is a 1000×1000 square cake. We use knife to cut the cake. The problem is after a series of
cutting, how many partitions the cake will has.

Assumption:

1. The number of the cutting will be no more than 8.

2. After the cutting, the length of any edge of the partition will
no less than 1.

3. The vertex coordinates of the cake are (0,0)(0,1000)(1000,1000)
(1000,0).

4. The intersections of the cut line and the cake edge are two .

The Graph on the right is a sample partition. The number of
the partitions is 10.

## Input
The first line of the input is an integer M , then a blank line followed by M datasets. There is a blank
line between datasets.

The first line of each dataset is the number of the cutting. The following lines contain the information
of the cut lines. Each line has 4 integer number, which represent the coordinate of the intersection of
the cut line and the cake edge.

## Output
The output for each dataset is the number of the partitions of the cake. Print a blank line between
datasets.
