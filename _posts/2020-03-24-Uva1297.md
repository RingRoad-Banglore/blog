title: Uva 01297  The Minimun Number of Rooks
---


```

A sawtoothed chess-board is a chess-board whose boundary forms
two staircases from left down to right. See the figure on the right
for an example.

A square is dominated by a rook if it is in the same row or
column with this rook. Your task is to determine the minimun
number of rooks such that every square in a sawtoothed chess-
board is dominated by at least one rook. For example, see the
above figure again. It needs only four rooks located at the squares
with a dot to dominate all the squares.
```

## Input

```
The input data will contain multiple test cases. Each test case
will consist of less than 100 pairs of integers which represent the
row and column indexes of the corner points, in clockwise order, in a sawtoothed chess-board starting
from the upper-left most corner. For example, the corner points in the above figure are v1, v2, . . . , v12,
respectively. Each corner point is represented by its x and y coordinates in the 2-dimensional xy-plane
whose values are in the range from 1 to 100. For example, the indexes of v1,v2 and v3 are (1,1), (1,4)
and (3,4), respectively. The input for each test case will be terminated with a pair of zeros, wich are
not to be treated as the indexes of a corner point. An additional pair of zeros will follow the last test
case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, determine the minimun number of rooks needed to dominate all of the squares in the
sawtoothed chess-board described in the test case. Display, one test case a line, the test case number
(they are numbered sequentially starting with 1) and the number of rooks which are separated by one
blank.
