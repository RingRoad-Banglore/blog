title: Uva 13281  Bermuda  Polygon

```
After about five decades, people have started showing interest in the Bermuda Polygon again. Rumors
say, there are some points on the earths surface which can cause ships and aircrafts to disappear within
its enclosed region under unknown circumstances. The points where the ships disappear are known as
ship-sinks, and the points causing this phenomena are bermuda-points. Geometers and Maritime
scientists from all around the globe have gathered to investigate the existence of any such thing. Little
Anita, being a talented programmer and crazy about geometry is invited  to  be  the  part  of  this  team.

Bermuda  Polygon  was  previously  known  as  following:
- It is a Spherical Polygon formed by connecting some coordinates (bermuda-points) on the surface

of  earth  such  that  the  enclosed  region  contains  one  or  more  ship-sinks.
The  team  of  scientists  clarified  a  bit  more  on  the  matter:

 Bermuda Polygon (if exists) can only be found in the half sphere formed by all the points with
latitude within range  (-90, +90) and longitude within range  (0, +180), i.e. 90 < Latitude < 90
and 0 < Longitude < 180.

 Every Spherical Polygon on the earths surface can divide the earth in two bounded parts with
non zero surface area. But Bermuda Polygon will surely be the one with the smaller surface
area.

From definition, a Spherical Polygon of K(> 2) points (each defined as Pi ) on the earths surface is
the set  of  following  ordered  geodesic  line  segments:

P1P2, P2P3, . . . , PkP1

Where,  no  two  segments  intersect  with  each  other.
The geodesic line segment between two points on a sphere is the shortest connecting curve lying

entirely  on  the  surface  of  the  sphere.

The team has analyzed satellite footages for last couple of years. These footages are related to ships on
international water. They have found some interesting leads and pinpointed some sets of coordinates
which seem to be very mysterious based on recent events. Now, they have given Anita the job to shortlist
those sets where the Bermuda Polygon probably exists. As you were her Geo learning  partner,  she 
 asks  you  for  help.

Anita told you that, a given set of coordinates (points with latitude and longitude value) can
probably indicate the existence of the Bermuda Polygon if you can draw a Spherical Polygon by taking
minimum number of points from the given set such that all other points of the set are within the region
enclosed by its contour (including its boundary). Here, the other points are the points of ship-sinks.

Anita  cant  be  sure  about  a  probable  Bermuda  Polygon  if  there  are  no  ship-sinks.

You will be given latitude and longitude of N points. Points will be located on one half of the
earths sphere (as clarified by the team of scientists). Radius of that sphere is 103 .  You have to find
whether these  points  indicate  the  existence  of  the  Bermuda  Polygon.

## Input

```
The  first  line  will  contain  a  single  integer D (D  150) ,  denoting  the  number  of  data  sets.

The first line of each data set will contain N (3  N  200) . Next  N lines will contain two integers
denoting Latitude and Longitude of a point respectively. Latitude is given as an angular measurement
ranging from  90 (South Pole) to  +90 (North Pole). Longitude is given as an angular measurement
ranging from  0 at the Prime Meridian to  +180 eastward. The ranges are exclusive and the coordinates 
 are  unique.  That  means,  90 < Latitud < 90  and 0 < Longitude < 180.

## Output

```
If there exists a probable Bermuda Polygon, print the  id of the bermuda-points (the order they appear
in the input, from  0 to N  1 ) in ascending order separated by spaces. If the existence of the Bermuda
Polygon  is  inconclusive,  then  print inconclusive  without  quotes.
