## Input

```
Kamal is a Motashota guy. He has got a new job in Chittagong. So, he has moved to Chittagong
from Dinajpur. He was getting fatter in Dinajpur as he had no work in his hand there. So, moving
to Chittagong has turned to be a blessing for him. Every morning he takes a walk through the hilly
roads of charming city Chittagong. He is enjoying this city very much. There are so many roads in
Chittagong and every morning he takes different paths for his walking. But while choosing a path he
makes sure he does not visit a road twice not even in his way back home. An intersection point of a
road is not considered as the part of the road. In a sunny morning, he was thinking about how it would
be if he could visit all the roads of the city in a single walk. Your task is to help Kamal in determining
whether it is possible for him or not.
