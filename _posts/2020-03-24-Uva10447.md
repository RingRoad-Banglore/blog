title: Uva 10447  Sumup the Primes II
---


```
We all know from Goldbachs conjecture that any even number greater than 2 can be expressed as a
summation of two primes. Some odd numbers can also be expressed as summation of two primes. In
this problem you will have to express a number as a summation of arbitrary number of primes less than
300. The conditions in detail are as follows:

1. You have to express a number N (0  N  800) as a summation of t (t  12) primes.

2. Among the t primes any single odd primes pi can be present maximum fi times, where (0 < fi < 5).
2 can be present at most once. The details regarding presence of 2 are given in the sample input
description.

3. All the prime numbers used must be less than 300.

4. When there is more than one solution print the lexicographically smallest one.

5. If there is no such expression of primes print the string No Solution. without the quotes.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several blocks of input. The first line of the input file contains an integer B
(B  500), which indicates the number of blocks in the input file. The description of each block is
given below:

Each block starts with four lines, which contains 61 integers in total. These integers are the values
fi (for i = 1 . . . 61, as there are 61 odd primes less than 300. For example the maximum frequency of 3
is f1, frequency of 5 is f2, etc). The first three of the four lines will have 16 integers and the last one
will have 13 integers. The next line contains a positive integer Q (Q  100) that indicates the number
of queries in this block. Next Q lines contain Q queries. Each query consists of three integers N , t,
flag. The meaning of N and t is given in the problem statement. The integer flag is actually Boolean.
When flag is 1 you can use 2 once in your summation expression but otherwise you cannot.

```

## Output

```
For each block of input print a line indicating the serial of the block. For each query, print maximum two
lines of output. The first line contains the query serial and the next line contains the lexicographically
smallest way of expressing the prime as summation. If there is no possible ways, print the line No
Solution.. Look at the sample output for details. Print a blank line after the output for each block
of input.
