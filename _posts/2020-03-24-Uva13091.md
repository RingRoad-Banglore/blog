title: Uva 13091  No Ball

```
In the sport of cricket, a No Ball is a penalty against
the fielding team, usually as a result of an illegal de-
livery by the bowler. The delivery of a No Ball gives
an extra run to the opponent team. It might also
give a warning under some regulations  even a sus-
pension if it is extreme, and an additional ball must
be bowled. In addition, the only way a batsman can
get out in a No Ball is run out. In Twenty20s and
recently one-day cricket matches, even in some am-
ateur cricket, a batsman receives a free hit on the
ball after No Ball due to over stepping. This means
the batsman can freely hit the ball with no danger of
being out in certain ways. No Balls are not uncom-
mon, especially in short form cricket, and fast bowlers tend to bowl them more often than spin bowlers,
due to their longer run-up.

A No Ball may be called for many reasons. The most common No Ball is front foot No Ball. If
the bowler bowls without some part of the front foot landing either grounded or in the air behind the
popping crease or behind the line (as in the picture above).

However, umpires (on field judge in cricket) now-a-days, making mistakes to call a No Ball and teams
are getting extra benefit for their mistakes. So ICPC (International Cricket Problem-solver Committee)
wants to automate the process of calling No Ball. They will set a camera over the position of the line
and take picture during bowling and detect the No Ball in real time.

ICPC wants to give you to write a program to detect the No Ball in real time. They will provide
you the image data as a 5 5 grid as below,

..|.. ..|..

..|>. .>|..

..|.. ..|..

..|.. ..|..

..|.. ..|..

No Ball Not a No Ball

Here . is an empty field cell, | represents the line and > represents the bowlers front foot.
But if the camera is malfunctioning sometimes it gives 180 degree clockwise rotated images like

below,

Normal 180 degree rotated

Here, | represents the line, > and < represents the front foot of bowler facing right and left respec-
tively. According to the rules of No Ball and given image grid, we can say that, if the line is behind
the front foot in any image then it is a No Ball, otherwise not.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 13091  No Ball 2/2

Given an image as a 5  5 grid mentioned above, you have to detect whether the delivery is a No
Ball or not.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input contains an integer T (T  50), number of test cases. Each test case consists of
5 lines describing the 5  5 grid. The grid will consist of . (dot), |, < and >. There will be no
other characters or symbols in the input. There will be exactly one of the characters from < and >
in the input. There will be exactly one column with all |, which represents the popping crease line.

There will be a blank line after each test case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the test case number and print No Ball if the corresponding grid represents
a No Ball. Otherwise, print Thik Ball.
