## Input

```text
The Fibonacci word sequence of bit strings is defined as:

F (n) =




0 if n = 0
1 if n = 1
F (n 1) + F (n 2) if n  2

Here + denotes concatenation of strings. The first few elements are:

n F (n)

0 0
1 1
2 10
3 101
4 10110
5 10110101
6 1011010110110
7 101101011011010110101
8 1011010110110101101011011010110110
9 1011010110110101101011011010110110101101011011010110101

Given a bit pattern p and a number n, how often does p occur in F (n)?
```

## Output

```text
The first line of each test case contains the integer n (0  n  100). The second line contains the bit
pattern p. The pattern p is nonempty and has a length of at most 100 000 characters.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, display its case number followed by the number of occurrences of the bit pattern p
in F (n). Occurrences may overlap. The number of occurrences will be less than 263.

```

## Sample Output
