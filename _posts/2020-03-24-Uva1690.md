title: Uva 01690  Find a Minor
---


## Input

```text

In a graph G, contraction of an edge e with endpoints u, v is the replacement of u and v with a single
vertex such that edges incident to the new vertex are the edges other than e that were incident with u
or v. The resulting graph has one less edge than G. A graph H is a minor of a graph G if a copy of H
can be obtained from G via repeated edge deletion, edge contraction and isolated node deletion.

Minors play an important role in graph theory. For example, every non-planar graph contains either
the graph K3,3 (i.e., the complete bipartite graph on two sets of three vertices) or the complete graph
K5 as a graph minor.

Write a program to find a graph minor Kn,m or Kn in an undirected connected simple graph.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains an integers V (3  V  12),
the number of vertices in the graph, followed by a string in format Kn or Kn,m (1  n,m  V ), the
graph minor youre finding. The following V lines contain the adjacency matrix of the graph (1 means
directly connected, 0 means not directly connected).

The diagonal elements of the matrix will always be 0, and the element in row i column j is always
equal to the element in row j column i. The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should
not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and the string Found or Not found.

```
