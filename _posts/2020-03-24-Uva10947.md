title: Uva 10947  Bear with me again
---


## Input

```
There are bears everywhere! In fact, look around,
there might be one around you!

Okay, maybe not.

Heres the story:
Larry is trying to come up with some kind of es-

cape plan from the island.. and then realizes that
hes struck with nothing except for Ryan, some duct
tape, and some cardboard. What are the odds? He
knows how to (somewhat) build a raft of sorts from it!
Unforunately for Larry, since his craftmenship isnt
quite good, not to mention he really have no tools, he
can only build a raft that lasts K straight days at sea,
after of which if it can get to an island, it can be fixed
up and reused. He notices that he and Ryan can row
at a speed of M miles per day. Still, with some luck,
and Ryans GPS (which came with the super-iPod,
you see), he is able to see islands from far far away.
Somehow all the islands are perfectly circular... and
he knows exactly where home is... can he get there,
hopping on islands along the way?

So doing some calculations, he realizes his fate...
```

## Output

```
Everything will in miles.

First line will contain the integers K and M , as
defined above in the problem.

The second line of each input will contain three
integers, space limited: x, y, r. x and y being the coordinates of the current island, the r being the
radius of the island (somehow, all the islands are perfectly circular.)

Third line will contain three integers in the same format as above, will contain the location and
radius of the island they want to get to.

Then there will be a single integer N which is followed by N lines, each in the format of xi, yi, and
ri, each representing an island coordinate and its radius in miles. N will be at most 100.

No islands will have overlaps, and all integers representing coordinates and radius will be less than
200.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output

Larry and Ryan will escape!

if they can get back to their home island in some way, or

Larry and Ryan will be eaten to death.

if they cannot get home.
