1163 The Right Tip

During the recent Football Worldcup, a group of friends worked at a courtyard caf to pay for their
holidays. Everyday they would collect all the tips given by the customers on a jar, and at the end of the
day they wanted to split the tips equally between them. After a few days, they reached the conclusion
that (given the various face values of euro coins) sometimes it was not possible to equally split the
collect of the day between them.

Write a program to help the friends determine if it is possible (or not) to equally split the collect of
the day between them.

## Input

The input will consist of a sequence of pairs of lines, each pair represents a coin division problem to be
solved. For each such pair the first line contains the number of friends (a positive integer not greater
than 5). The second line contains eight space separated non-negative integers n1, n2, . . . , n8, where ni
is the number of coins of value i (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 euros respectively, e.g.,
the number of 5 cents coins will be denoted by n3). The maximum number of coins is 10000. Input is
terminated by a single line with the number ‘-1’.

## Output

For each coin division problem print either ‘yes’ or ‘no’, depending on whether it is possible or not to
divide equally the tips by the friends.

## Sample Input
<p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2 1 2 1 5 2 2 1</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>3423 234 324 972 740 12 234 901</p><p></p><p>4</p><p></p><p>147 5502 3486 434 76 66 267 20</p><p></p><p>5</p><p></p><p>3015 3590 1559 1219 78 507 23 8</p><p></p><p>-1</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p></p><p>no</p><p></p><p>yes</p><p></p><p>yes</p><p></p><p>no</p><p></p><p>yes</p>
