## Input

```text
Dhaka city is getting crowded and noisy day by day. Certain roads always remain blocked in congestion.
In order that people avoid shortest routes, and hence the crowded roads, to reach destination, the city
authority has made a new plan. Each junction of the city is marked with a positive integer ( 20)
denoting the busyness of the junction. Whenever someone goes from one junction (the source junction)
to another (the destination junction), the city authority gets the amount (busyness_of_destination
busyness_of_source)3 from the traveler.

The authority has appointed you to find out the minimum total amount that it earns when someone
goes from a certain junction (the zero point) to several others.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of each test case contains n (the number of junctions, 0  n  200) followed by n integers
denoting the busyness of the junctions numbered 1 to n in that order. The next line contains r, the
number of roads in the city. Each of the next r lines (one for each road) contains two junction-numbers
(source, destination) that the corresponding road connects (all roads are unidirectional). The next line
contains the integer q, the number of queries. The next q lines each contain a junction-number. Input
is terminated by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of output, print the Set #x (x = 1, 2, . . .) followed by q lines, one for each query,
each containing the minimum total earning when one travels from junction 1 (the zero point) to the
corresponding junction. However, for the queries that gives less than 3 units of minimum total earning,
print a ?.
