title: Uva 10562  Undraw the Trees

## Input

```
Professor Homer has been reported missing. We suspect that his recent research works might have had
something to with this. But we really dont know much about what he was working on! The detectives
tried to hack into his computer, but after hours of failed efforts they realized that the professor had
been lot more intelligent than them. If only they could realize that the professor must have been absent
minded they could get the clue rightaway. We at the crime lab were not at all surprised when the
professors works were found in a 3.5 floppy disk left inside the drive.

The disk contained only one text file in which the professor had drawn many trees with ASCII
characters. Before we can proceed to the next level of investigation we would like to match the trees
drawn with the ones that we have in our database. Now you are the computer geek we leave this
trivial task for you. Convert professors trees to our trees.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file (which you can assume comes from standard input) contains the number
of trees, T (1  T  20) drawn in the file. Then you would have T trees, each ending with a single
hash (#) mark at the beginning of the line. All the trees drawn here are drawn vertically in top down
fashion. The labels of each of node can be any printable character except for the symbols -, |, 
 (space) and #. Every node that has children has a | symbol drawn just below itself. And in the
next line there would be a series of - marks at least as long as to cover all the immediate children.
The sample input section will hopefully clarify your doubts if there is any. No tree drawn here requires
more than 200 lines, and none of them has more than 200 characters in one line.

```

## Sample Input

```
Our trees are drawn with parenthesis and the node labels. Every subtree starts with an opening
parenthesis and ends with a closing parenthesis; inside the parenthesis the node labels are listed. The
sub trees are always listed from left to right. In our database each tree is written as a single string in
one line, and they do not contain any character except for the node labels and the parenthesis pair.
The node labels can be repeated if the original tree had such repetitions.
