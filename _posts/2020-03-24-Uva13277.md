title: Uva 13277  XOR  Path
---


## Input

```
You are given an unrooted weighted tree. The weights on the edges are
 16 bit unsigned integers, that is they are between  0 to  2161  (inclusive).
For every integer  x in the range  0 to  216  1 (inclusive) find out how
many pairs (unordered) of distinct nodes in the given tree have distance
 x . Distance between two nodes in the tree is defined as the bitwise xor
of the edge weights  on  the  path  between  these  two  nodes.

For  example  consider  the  tree  on  the  right:
There are four nodes  A ,  B ,  C and  D in this tree. The edge weights

are:  AB (5) ,  AC (2) and  AD (1) . So the  distance  between  A  and  D 
 is  1,   B  and C  is  7 ,  B  and  D  is  4  etc.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T  10) denoting the number of test cases. Hence
T cases follow. Each case starts with a positive integer  n (n  100000) denoting the number of nodes
in the tree. Hence n 1 lines follow with the format u v w meaning there is an edge between  u and
v  (1  u, v  n)   with  the  weight w .

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output the case number (no trailing space after Case  x: ) followed by the number
of paths with the distance  x for every  x in the range  0 to 216  1 (inclusive). There should  NOT be
empty line(s)  between  two  cases.  Please  see  the Sample Input  output  for  the  details.
Note for the Sample: Please  note,  the  output below  is  truncated  intentionally  to  save  the trees, 
 electricity,  ram  consumption,  network  bandwidth  and  so  on. In fact, till 216  9,  0s  follow.
