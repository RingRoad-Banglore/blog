## Input

```
Well, in this problem you are given an R  C grid (1  R  109 and 1  C  10). There will be B
blocks (1  B  100) in the grid. Each block will be placed in a cell of the grid. There can be more
than one blocks in a cell.

Now you are given M identical tokens and you can place them in the first row as you like. A cell
cannot contain more than one token and you also cannot place a token in a cell occupied by blocks.
Now you can move a token but you have to follow following rules:

1. If there is a token in a cell (r, c) then you can move it to either (r + 1, c 1) or (r + 1, c+ 1).

2. You cannot move a token to a cell occupied by blocks.

3. You cannot move a token outside of the grid.

4. You cannot move two or more tokens to the same cell.

5. All the tokens should be moved to i-th row before any token can be moved (i+ 1)-th row.

Now let S = {(1, c1), (1, c2), . . . , (1, cM )} be the set of cells of where you placed M identical tokens
and W (S) = number of ways you can move these tokens to last row. You have to find the sum of W
for every possible S.

For R = 2, C = 2, M = 1 and B = 0 the answer is 2.
```

## Output

```
First line contains number of test cases 1  T  500. For each test case, the first line contains
1  R  109, 1  C  10 and 0  M  C respectively. The second line contains 0  B  100,
followed by B lines and each of those B lines contains two integers r and c, (1  r  R and 1  c  C)
indicating the cell position of each block.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test cases you have to output the answer in a single line as shown in the sample output. As
the answer can be very large you have to mod the output with 12345.
