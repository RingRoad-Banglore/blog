## Input

```text

The figure shown on the left is left-right symmetric as it is possible to fold the sheet of paper along a
vertical line, drawn as a dashed line, and to cut the figure into two identical halves. The figure on the
right is not left-right symmetric as it is impossible to find such a vertical line.

Write a program that determines whether a figure, drawn with dots, is left-right symmetric or not.
The dots are all distinct.
```

## Output

```text
The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases T is given in the first line of the input file.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N , where N (1  N  1, 000) is the number of dots
in a figure. Each of the following N lines contains the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a dot. Both
x-coordinates and y-coordinates are integers between 10, 000 and 10, 000, both inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should contain YES if the figure is left-right symmetric,
and NO, otherwise.
