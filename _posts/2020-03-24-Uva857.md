MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a standard for transmitting musical performance data
between devices. With MIDI, each event of a performance (e.g., pressing or releasing a key of a piano)
is encoded in a message. A typical MIDI message essentially consists of a code and a note, and says
that a given key (corresponding to a given note) was pressed (the code NoteOn) or released (NoteOff
code).

If we register all the events of a performance and associate a convenient time stamp with them,
we will be able to reproduce the performance later with precision. We may also make many other
things, like editing the data or producing a score in standard, human readable, music notation. This
last application will be our focus: we want to prepare performance data stored in a file so that the
production of a score becomes easy.

Figure 1 presents an example of a performance (4 notes, 8 events) and the corresponding data, in the
form <code, note, time stamp>. The time stamp is represented by the triple <measure:beat:tick>.
To make things simpler, we will consider that a measure is a positive integer and has always 4 beats
(numbered 1 to 4) and each beat has 480 ticks (numbered 0 to 479).

Figure 1

NoteOn, 35, 23:1:0
NoteOn, 52, 23:1:0
NoteOn, 43, 23:2:0
NoteOff, 52, 23:3:0
NoteOff, 35, 23:4:0
NoteOn, 35, 24:1:0
NoteOff, 43, 24:1:0
NoteOff, 35, 24:2:0

This performance may be easily converted to standard
music notation, as all the events occur at the exact be-
ginning of a beat (tick 0). The same would happen if they
occurred in points corresponding to subdivisions of the beat
that match certain musical rhythm symbols. To simplify, we will consider divisions of the beats in 2,
4 and 8 parts as corresponding to legal musical notation; thus, if the events occur in ticks like 60, 240
or 420, the production of the score will be possible.

The events in Figure 1, however, could hardly be produced by an human. Humans cant be so precise:
their performances have subtle imprecisions in timing and in other parameters. These imprecisions
make a direct production of a score virtually impossible.

Figure 2 represents a possible human performance.

We may see that the times where the events occur are close to correct points. For instance, the
fourth event occurs close to 23:3:000, the fifth close to 23:3:240 and the sixth close to 24:1:000. To
produce a readable score from this data, we may change the time stamps to make them fit the closest
correct points: this process is called Quantisation.

The short note 33 near the beginning of measure 24 (in italic) represents a special case: after
quantisation, its duration becomes zero. We will filter notes in these conditions.

Make a program that, given a performance consisting of a sequence of no more than 2.000 events,
produces a new sequence after quantising the data. Notes whose duration becomes zero after quantisa-
tion must be filtered out. If a time stamp is equally close to two different correct points, quantise it to
the upper point (for example, 23 1 30 becomes 23 1 60). The program should be able to process
several performances each time it runs.
```

## Input

```
The input file represents several performances. Input for each performance consists of a sequence of
lines, as follows:

First line: n

 where n is the number of messages of the performance

Next n lines (up to 2.000): code note m b t

 where code is the number 1 for a Note On event or the number 0 for a Note Off event; note is
a positive number representing a piano key; m is a positive integer representing the measure; b is
1, 2, 3 or 4 and represents the beat; t is an integer between 0 and 479, and represents the tick.

The messages of a performance are ordered by increasing times.
Successive values on a line are separated by one blank. The integer -1 follows the data of the last

performance.

```

## Output

```
Output should give, for each given performance, the following output:

First line: n

 where n is the number of the messages of the quantised performance

Next n lines: code note m b t

 where the meaning of the symbols is the same as for the input file

The messages of each performance must be ordered by increasing times.
The integer -1 must follow the data of the last performance.
