title: Uva 11215  How Many Numbers
---


## Input

```
You might have heard the game of 24: given 4 integers, youre to make an expression to get the number
24. For example, given 4, 4, 10, 10, you can write (10  10 4)/4 = 24, given 1, 5, 5, 5, you can write
(5 1/5)  5 = 24.

In this problem, your task is a little bit harder: count the number of numbers that can be made.
Dont forget to count negative numbers and non-integers. You can use binary additions, subtractions,
multiplications and divisions with parenthesis (unary operations are not allowed). Numbers cannot be
concatenated to form a larger number (e.g. you cannot concatenate 1 and 2 to get 12).

For example, given two 1s, exactly 3 numbers can be made: 1+1=2, 1-1=0, 1  1 = 1. You cannot
get 11 or -1.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of at most 30 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing a single integer n
(1 < n < 7), the number of integers given. The next line contains n non-negative integers not greater
than 10. The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the number of numbers that can be made.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
1 1
3
1 4 7
4
1 2 3 5
0

```
