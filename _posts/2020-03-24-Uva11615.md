Important families are like potatoes.

The best parts are underground.
Francis Bacon

A family tree is a chart representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. The more
detailed family trees used in medicine, genealogy, and social work are known as genograms. Several
genealogical numbering systems have been widely adopted for presenting family trees. Some of
them are ascending numbering systems.

Ahnentafel, also known as the Eytzinger Method, Sosa Method, and Sosa-Stradonitz
Method, allows for the numbering of ancestors beginning with a descendant. This system allows
one to derive an ancestors number without compiling the list, and allows one to derive an ancestors
relationship based on their numbers.

The number of a persons father is the double of his own number, and the number of a persons
mother is the double of his own plus one. For instance, if the number of John Smith is 10, his father is
20, and his mother is 21.

The first 15 numbers, identifying individuals in 4 generations, are as follows:

(First Generation)
1 Subject

(Second Generation)
2 Father
3 Mother

(Third Generation)
4 Father's father
5 Father's mother
6 Mother's father
7 Mother's mother

(Fourth Generation)
8 Father's father's father
9 Father's father's mother

10 Father's mother's father
11 Father's mother's mother
12 Mother's father's father
13 Mother's father's mother
14 Mother's mother's father
15 Mother's mother's mother

It is possible (and usual) that two or more individuals are the same, and so are the ancestors.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 11615  Family Tree 2/2

Complete binary tree for four generations

We have built our complete family tree, including until the N -th generation. But we have found
out that two of our ancestors are brothers (they have the same parents).

We want to know the amount of different people of our family tree (including us).
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases. For each test case,
there is a line with three positive integer numbers N , A and B, separated by blanks, (4  N  20),
where N is the number of generations, and A and B are brothers with the same parents.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output should consist of one integer indicating the amount of different people of
our family tree (including us).

```

## Sample Input

```
3
4 4 12
4 4 6
5 2 3

```

## Sample Output

```
15
13
