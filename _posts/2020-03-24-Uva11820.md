title: Uva 11820  Warp Speed

```
In the not-so-distance future, space engineers can invent a new technology for traveling through space
and name it as warp-drive. This warp-drive can make a spaceship travel faster than light speed. It
works by bending an amount of distance in space and make a ship travel through that bended space
in a single hop. And since the time spent for each hop is equal, the total traveling time for any
spaceship (that is equipped with this warp-drive) depends on the number of hops it make. Moreover,
these engineers notice that distance of a hop depends on some kind of force fields in the space where
that hop is operated. To travel from a beginning to an ending point, a spaceship may have to pass
through many force fields, which may make that spaceship hop so many times.

And from their experiments, they found some facts as follow.

 A number of force field types is quite small.

 So one English character can be used to name each of these force filed types.

 A spaceship can pass through every single force field in a single hop.

 A spaceship can pass through a certain sequences of two or more force fields in a single hop. And
these certain sequences are kept as rules of single-hop-able sequences.

 An example of list of these rules is shown as in the following table.

Rules of Single-hop-able Sequences
ab
abcd
abd
bde

 In this example, there are 4 rules, which means that a spaceship can pass through each
of them using a single hop. The first one is ab, which means that a spaceship can pass
through a and b force field in a single hop. The second one is abcd which means that
it can pass through a, b, c and d in one hop.

 Please be notified that there is no abc sequence/rule in this example, so even though the
ship can pass through abcd sequence, it is unable to pass through abc (in a single hop).
It has to make 2 hops, the first hop is to pass through ab sequence and the second hop is
to pass through c force field.

Goal:
Suppose that you are an engineer on a battle spaceship. Your duty is to drive your spaceship

through space as fast as possible. Your spaceship has a probe device that can identify a sequence of
force fields along the path to your destination. In order to accomplish your duty, you have to build a
computer program to find the minimum hop based on rules and any given sequences of force fields.

## Input

```
Input is standard inputs which contain 2 parts of data which are separated by a blank line.

The first part is a set of rules of single-hop-able sequences. The number of rules is between 1 and
10,000.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 11820  Warp Speed 2/3

 Each line in this first part contains one rule.

 Each rule is a (sub)sequence of force fields specified by a string of alphabets (a-z, A-Z).

 The order in every (sub)sequence is from left to right.

 The size of any (sub)sequence is between 2 and 20.

The second part is a set of force fields along path that a spaceship has to pass through. The number
of sequence is between 1 and 200.

 Each line in this second part contains one sequence of force field in one path.

 Each sequence is specified by a string of alphabets (a-z, A-Z).

 The order in every sequence is from left to right.

 The size of any sequence is between 2 and 500.

The blank line after the second part is the termination of the input.

```

## Output

```
For each sequence in the second part of input, write 2 parts of output as follows

 In the first line, write the total number of solutions followed by a space and the number of
minimum hops.

 In the following lines, write each of the solutions in each line. Each solution contains a sequence
of force fields as given in the input, where a space is inserted between each hop sub sequences. If
there are two or more solutions, they must be sorted by ascending and lexicographical (ASCII)
order.

More Explanations: There are 5 rules and 5 input sequences in this sample input.
In the first sample output, there is 1 solution with 2 hops. The first hop is from the first rule.
In the second output, there is 1 solution with 1 hop using the second rule for the whole sequence.
In the third output, there are 2 solutions with 2 hops. Its first solution is from the 4-th rule and

the second solution is from the 3-rd rule.
In the fourth output, there are 4 solutions with 4 hops. The first solution is applied using the 4-th

rule twice. The second and third is applied using the 3-rd and 4-th rules in different position. The last
solution is applied using the 3-rd rules twice

The last output is quite similar to the fourth one, but it is also applied with the fifth rule in the
middle of the sequence.
