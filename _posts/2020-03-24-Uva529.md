title: Uva 00529  Addition Chains
---


## Input

```text
An addition chain for n is an integer sequence < a0, a1, a2, . . . , am > with the following four properties:

 a0 = 1

 am = n

 a0 < a1 < a2 <    < am1 < am

 For each k (1  k  m) there exist two (not neccessarily different) integers i and j (0  i, j  k1)
with ak = ai + aj

You are given an integer n. Your job is to construct an addition chain for n with minimal length.
If there is more than one such sequence, any one is acceptable.

For example, < 1, 2, 3, 5 > and < 1, 2, 4, 5 > are both valid solutions when you are asked for an
addition chain for 5.
```

## Output

```text
The input file will contain one or more test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one
integer n (1  n  10000). Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for n.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print one line containing the required integer sequence. Separate the numbers by
one blank.

```

## Sample Output

```text
5
7
12
15
77
0

```
