title: Uva 11914  An Amazing Race
---


## Input

```
You are participating in an adventure game called An Amazing Race.
You are now at the coast of a desert island, and you have to visit a number
of checkpoints, then go to the target at the highest point of the island. Of
course, the first person who arrives at the target wins the race.

The temperature is now 45oC. It is a must to drink lots of water in
such hot environment. However, you are not allowed to take any drinking
water with you in your journey (!!). Water is only supplied at checkpoints
as well as the starting and target locations, so you would like to choose
your route such that the maximum distance between two consecutively
visited water-supplying spots is minimized. Observing this, you would
then like to find a shortest route.

You may write a program to help you.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of each case gives three integers r, c, k (3  r, c  20;
1  k  10). Then there are r lines, each with c characters, which is the map of the island. A tilde
sign   in the map denotes sea area, which cannot be travelled past. A hash sign # denotes normal
land area. The island is of course surrounded by sea. S marks the starting location, while T is the
target. As mentioned above, the starting location is always on the coast. Each checkpoint is denoted
by a unique letter from the set {A, , K}. You must visit at least k different checkpoints, and then finish
your journey at the target location T. You may visit a checkpoint more than once, and the visiting
order is also unimportant.

In each step, you may travel from a land area to another only if they share a common edge, i.e.
you may only go north, south, east or west (by north we mean facing upwards). The island is rather
flat, hence the time required to travel to an adjacent square is the same everywhere on the island (no
need to consider the gradient). You can further assume that all checkpoints are safely reachable, so it
is indeed possible for you to win the race, provided that your route is planned optimally observing the
above-mentioned requirements. The sample input corresponds to the figure.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, your program should output a single line with the description of an optimal path. Use
the letters N, S, E and W to denote north, south, east and west respectively. If there are many
solutions, output the lexicographically smallest one.

Explanation: The optimal path is shown in red on the right:
