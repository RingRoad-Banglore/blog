## Input

```text

Archibald and Adalbert are inseparable friends and the best knights of the whole kingdom. Competitive
as they are, they occasionally engage in a little open-air sword ght, just to determine who among them
really is the rst knight. Of course, neither Adalbert nor Archibald wins, but they keep themselves busy
for quite a while and get around in the surroundings. You have to calculate about how long their next
ght will last.

All the action takes place in a rectangular area which, for the sake of simplicity, is divided into unit
squares numbered from (1, 1) to (m,n). Starting at (1, 1), the knights move from one square to one of
the at most four adjacent squares, and nish as soon as they reach (m,n) where the tavern is located.
At each square, it is largely a matter of chance where the ght will continue, but it also depends on the
environment (for example, if a certain direction is uphill). Our model uses probabilities to decide into
which adjacent square the ght will move next. (For example, an uphill direction has a lower probability.)
It is your job to calculate the expected number of moves that are needed before the tavern is reached.
You can assume that every move is independent of the directions chosen in the previous moves.

## Output

```text
The input consists of a sequence of rectangular areas. Each area starts with a line containing the
dimensions of the rectangle m and n, where 1  m,n  40. Four blocks follow that state the probability
of a move in each direction. Every block contains m lines, and each line contains n numbers p

(k)
i,j , where

0  p(k)i,j  1 for all 1  i  m and 1  j  n and 1  k  4. The probabilities in block k are arranged
as follows:

p
(k)
1,1 p

(k)
1,2 p

(k)
1,3 . . . p

(k)
1,n1 p

(k)
1,n

p
(k)
2,1 p

2,2 p

(k)
2,n

p
(k)
m,1 p

(k)
m,2 p

(k)
m,3 . . . p

(k)
m,n1 p

(k)
m,n

The number p
(k)
i,j gives the probability of a move from square (i, j) to the next square: In block 1

this is (i + 1, j), in block 2 it is (i, j + 1), in block 3 it is (i  1, j) and in block 4 it is (i, j  1). For
each square (i, j) except the tavern (m,n), the probabilities p

(k)
i,j add up to 1 and at least one of p

(1)
i,j or

p
(2)
i,j is not 0. (This ensures that the tavern will nally be reached with probability 1.) You may assume

that the probability of moving outside the rectangle is 0, as are p
(k)
m,n for all k. The sequence of areas is

followed by a line containing two zeros.

## Sample Input

```text
For each area, output a line containing the expected number of moves from (1, 1) to (m,n). This
number must have an absolute error less than 0.1 compared to the exact answer that is always less than
1000000.
