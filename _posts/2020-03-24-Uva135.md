title: Uva 00135  No Rectangles
---


```
Consider a grid such as the one shown. We wish to mark k intersections
in each of n rows and n columns in such a way that no 4 of the selected
intersections form a rectangle with sides parallel to the grid. Thus for k = 2
and n = 3, a possible solution is:

It can easily be shown that for any given value of k, k2  k + 1 is a lower
bound on the value of n, and it can be shown further that n need never be
larger than this.

Write a program that will find a solution to this problem for k  32, k1
will be 0, 1 or prime.
```

## Input

```
Input will consist of some values for k, one per line.

```

## Output

```
For each value of k, output will consist of n lines of k points indicating the selected points on that line.

Print a blank line between two values of k.
