Tractor is a very popular poker game in China. There are four players in the game. Suppose their
names are Alice, Bob, Charles and David, in clockwise order. A judge is needed for this game. The
players are divided into two teams, Alice and Charles are in team 1, and the other two are in team 2.
The prop they use to play the game are two decks of pokers, including 108 cards in total. A simplified
rule of the game is described below.

The whole game contains a number of rounds. In each round, one team is called Declarers
(CT); the other team is called Defenders (FT). Each team has a current rank (CR). The goal
of the player is to increase his own teams CR as much as possible.

A certain round has a Main Suit (Heart - H, Spade - S, Club - C, Diamond D, or None - no
main suit in this round) and its CR. The CR in this round is the CR of the CT, and Main Suit will
be given. The Main Suit and CR will be used to determine the order of the cards.

Cards ranked 5, 10, King value 5, 10, 10 pts (points) respectively, all other cards value
0 pts. In one round, we only consider the FTs pts. The rules of getting pts for FT will be discussed
later.

If the FT gets less than 80 pts in one round, they will hold be FT in the next round. This situation
is called make. Otherwise, they become CT in the next round and the original CT become FT
instead. This situation is called down.

If the FT gets 0 pts, the CR of the current CT will be increased by 3, for example, if the CR of
the CT is 9, it will become Queen (12). Otherwise, if the FT gets less than 40 pts, the CR of the CT
will be increased by 2. Otherwise, if the FT gets less than 80 pts, the CR of the CT will be increased
by 1. Otherwise, if the FT gets not less than 80 + k  40 pts and less than 120 + k  40 pts, the CR of
the current FT will be increased by k. For example, if the FT gets 255 pts in a round, the CR of the
current FT will be increased by 4; and if the FT gets 80 pts, both teams CR remain unchanged. If a
teams CR becomes beyond Ace, this team is considered the WINNER of the whole game.

During a round, one of the players in CT is called the dealer. If make, the pard (teammate) of
the dealer becomes the next rounds dealer. Otherwise (down), the player on dealers right-hand side
becomes the dealer of the next round. For example, if the dealer of the current round is Alice and her
team (CT) is down, the dealer of the next round should be Bob (on Alices right-hand side).

At the start of a round, each of the players except the dealer gets exactly 25 cards; the dealer gets
all the remaining 33 cards. After that, the dealer chooses 8 of his cards and gives them to the judge,
and these cards are called hidden cards.

Now each player has exactly 25 cards. A round consists of several tricks. In the first trick, the
dealer plays one or more cards (called lead), then, in clockwise order, players play the same number
of cards as the first player one by one (called follow). The winner of the current trick leads cards
during the next trick, and so on. If the winner of the current trick is a member of FT, then
the FT gets the sum of the cards pts played in this trick.

Now we start to describe how to determine the winner of a trick. After the main suit and the CR
of the current round are fixed, we can determine the trumps which are cards with main suit or CR
(Current Rank), and the Jokers. All other cards are not-trumps.

We can have an order among all the cards according the following rules:

(1) Trumps are ordered higher than not-trumps.

(2) For the trumps, the order are listed below:

Red Joker

Black Joker

card with main suit and CR (if exists)

other card with CR

other trumps ordered by their ranks(i.e., A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, . . ., 3, 2)

(3) For the not-trumps, they are ordered by their ranks.

Assume in all the description below, in the current round, the CR of the CT is 7.

Suppose the main suit is H, the cards can be arranged in this order (as an example):

S2 , C2 , D2
< S3 , C3 , D3
< S4 , C4 , D4
< S5 , C5 , D5
< S6 , C6 , D6
< S8 , C8 , D8
< S9 , C9 , D9
< ST , FT , CT (T - 10)
< SJ , CJ , DJ (J - Jack)
< SQ , CQ , DQ (Q - Queen)
< SK , CK , DK (K - King)
< SA , CA , DA (A - Ace)
< H2
< H3
< H4
< H5
< H6
< H8
< H9
< HT
< HJ
< HQ
< HK
< HA
< S7 = C7 = D7
< H7
< BJ (the Black Joker)
< RJ (the Red Joker)

If None during this round, then the pokers can be arranged in this order:

H2 , S2 , C2 , D2
< H3 , S3 , C3 , D3
< H4 , S4 , C4 , D4
< H5 , S5 , C5 , D5
< H6 , S6 , C6 , D6
< H8 , S8 , C8 , D8
< H9 , S9 , C9 , D9

< HT , ST , FT , CT
< HJ , SJ , CJ , DJ
< HQ , SQ , CQ , DQ
< HK , SK , CK , DK
< HA , SA , CA , DA
< H7 = S7 = C7 = D7
< BJ
< RJ

In these two tables, cards written in italic are trumps, and cards written in boldface are
not-trumps.

In each trick, the lead cards (played by the player leading this trick) must be either all trumps,
or all not-trumps with same suit.

The possible structures of the cards are listed below (assume the main suit is H and main
rank is 7 for the example):

Single. A single card, such as D9.

Pair. Two same cards, such as D9D9. But D7S7 is not a pair although their orders are the same.

Tractor. Two or more consecutive-ordered pairs, satisfying the condition that they are all trumps,
or all not-trumps with same suit, such as SJSJSQSQSKSKSASA, H7H7S7S7HAHA or RJRJBJBJ. But,
these are not tractors: S7S7C7C7 (their orders are the same), C7C7C6C6 (they are not consecutive-
ordered), DADAD2D2 (Ace is not one, so they are not consecutive-ordered), H2H2H4H4, or D2D2D3.
Be careful: if None in this round, H7H7S7S7HAHA is not a tractor (H7 and S7 are same-ordered
because of None).

Throw. The combination of the structures above, satisfying the condition that they are all trumps,
or all not-trumps with same suit. Each of the Single, Pair or Tractor in a Throw is one
of the Throws component. In the original tractor game, in some situation, the throw will be
rejected. But, to keep the rule simple, we assume in this problem all the throws are accepted.
For example, RJRJBJBJH7H7HQHQHJHJH9H9H6H6HAH2 contains six components: two tractors, two
pairs and two single cards (RJRJBJBJH7H7-HQHQHJHJ-H9H9-H6H6-HA-H2); CACAC8C8CK contains
three components: two pairs and one single card (CACA-C8C8-CK).

A throw can be treated as different list of components, for example, H2H2H3H3H4H4H5H5H6H6 can
also be treated as H2H2H3H3-H4H4H5H5H6H6, or H2H2-H3H3H4H4H4H5H5-H6H6, and so on. For the lead
cards, each time we choose the longest component (choose the one with the highest order to break the
tie) to construct a list of components, this list is the structure of the lead cards, also the structure
of the trick. So that the structure of the trick is unique.

After the first player lead his or her cards, other players follow cards one by one in clockwise order,
as mentioned above.

An important part of the game is to determine the winner of a trick:
If ones follow cards contain both trumps and not-trumps, or all not-trumps but with different

suits, this player cant be winner of this trick.
Otherwise, if the lead cards are all not-trumps and ones follow cards contain not-trumps with

different suit from the lead cards, this follow player cant be the winner of this trick.
Else, if ones follow cards cant be constructed as the same structure of lead cards, this player cant

be the winner of this trick either.
Otherwise, if the structure of this trick is not throw, the one who played the highest-ordered card

wins this trick. If more than one player played the same highest-ordered card, the winner of this
trick will be the one who plays the highest-ordered card first.

Now lets consider the throw situation. We construct the follow cards into the structure of the
lead cards, so that the order of the highest-ordered card in all the longest components of the throw
is as high as possible (this card is called honor card). Note that tractor can be treated as
several pairs or shorter tractors, and pair can be treated as two single cards. The winner
of this trick is the one who plays the highest-ordered honor card. Similarly, if more than one player
played the same highest-ordered honor card the winner of this trick will be the one who plays the
highest-ordered honor card first.

There are many hair-raising rules about lead and follow cards; fortunately, theyre not related to
this problem, the only thing we care about is: when someone leads a not-trump throw the only
possible way to beat it is to throw the same structure of trumps. And its impossible to beat a
leading trump throw.

There is a special rule about hidden cards: if the winner of the last trick of a certain round is
a member of FT, then, in addition, the FT gets the sum of the hidden cards pts, multiplied by 2w
(2 to the power of w). When the structure of the final trick is not throw, then w is the
number of lead cards of the last trick of this round. If the structure is throw instead,
w is the length of the longest components, in the example RJRJBJBJH7H7HQHQHJHJH6H6HA, the
w is 6 because the length of RJRJBJBJH7H7 (the longest components of the throw) is 6.

Special attention on the examples below. In these examples, Alice always leads cards. And
assume in all the following examples, the CR is 7, and the main suit is H.

Alice Bob Charles David Winner Comments
SA S2 ST S5 Alice Alice plays the highest-ranked

card SA.
SA S2 ST SA Alice Alice plays the first SA.
SA S2 ST H2 David David plays the first only

trump.
SA H2 C7 D7 Charles Charles plays trump C7,

while David plays D7 with the
same order of C7.

C2C2 C3C4 C7D7 RJBJ Alice The structure of this trick
is pair, while all players

cards.

D3D3 DTDT SKSK H2H3 Bob Bob plays a pair with or-
der higher than Alices, while

D6D6D8D8 DJDJDKDK DTDTD2D3 HTHTBJBJ Alice Alice plays the only tractor
(because the CR is 7).

H6H6H8H8 H7H7BJBJ C2C2C3C4 HKHKRJRJ Bob Bobs tractor is higher-

To make the problem easier, you are only to write a single-round tractor game simulator.

## Input

```
Multiple test cases, the number of them T is given in the very first line. For each test case:
The first line contains the main suit of this round (H, S, C, D, O; O denotes None in this round), the dealer

of this round, the CR of team 1, the CR of team 2, separated by single spaces. Each of the rest lines contains 4
strings: the lead cards and the cards played by the second, third and last player. In one string, the cards can be
given in any order. Each player will play exactly 25 cards in one round.

You may assume the input is always valid.
There is a blank line between consecutive test cases, and a blank line also appears between T and the first

test case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case:
The first line contains the case number.
The second line contains the pts get by the FT in this round.
If a team wins the whole game after this round, output Winner: Team X (without quotes, X should be

either 1 or 2) in the second line. If no team wins, output the new CR of team 1, the new CR of team 2 after this
round, followed by the name of the dealer of the next round, separated by single spaces.

See the example for further details.
