title: Uva 12450  SpaceRecon Tournament
---


```
SpaceRecon, the hottest game of 2011, is a real-time strategy thriller where players control your armies
to destroy their opponent. Players may choose from one of the three available races  Xurks (biological),
Protoast (technological), and Earthians (humanoids)  to build their respective armies by collecting
resources from the land and spending them on army units, upgrades, and infrastructure. The player
who destroys or outlasts their opponent is victorious.

The game has an intricate single-player
story mode where players recreate scenes of
the survival of Earthian Commander John
Rainards travels through the Xurkling planet,
and also the charades of once-Earthian-now-
Xurkling Queen Stephanie Karpenter. After
completing the 15 hours of single player game-
play, most users try their hand at multiplayer
head-to-head battles online using Actionweb,
the number one SpaceRecon game matching
hub.

Actionweb hosts tournaments of 2M players
and publishes the results of each tournament
by listing each player handle and the number
of match victories in the tournament. Tourna-
ments are series of head-to-head matches between two players, the winner of the round advancing to
the next round. The first R rounds are best of three (i.e., win two matches to win the round, any
unnecessary games are not played), the remaining rounds are best of five (i.e., win three matches to
win the round, any unnecessary games are not played). Each tournament has a different value of R,
but is not published.
