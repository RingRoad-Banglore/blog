## Input

```
For any positive integer N , N = a21 + a22 + . . . + a2n that is, any positive integer can be represented as
sum of squares of other numbers.

Your task is to print the smallest n such that N = a21 + a22 + . . .+ a2n.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input will contain an integer t which indicates the number of test cases to follow.

Each test case will contain a single integer N  (1  N  10000) on a line by itself.

```

## Sample Input

```
Print an integer which represents the smallest n such that N = a21 + a22 + . . .+ a2n.

Explanation for sample test cases:

5  number of test cases
1 = 12 (1 term)
2 = 12 + 12 (2 terms)
3 = 12 + 12 + 12 (3 terms)
4 = 22 (1 term)
50 = 52 + 52 (2 terms)

```

## Sample Output

```
5
1
2
3
4
50

```
