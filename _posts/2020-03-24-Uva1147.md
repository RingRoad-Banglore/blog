title: Uva 01147  Crime

## Input

```
The city of X (for reasons that will become clear, the name of this city is kept secret) is one of the
safest cities in the country. However, the mayor of X has decided to eliminate crime completely.

The Perfect Police Patrol System (PPPS)
The Perfect Police Patrol System is the mayors response to crime. According to the mayors

analysis, the city consists of intersections and streets, where every street connect two intersections.
Crime must be eliminated from the streets.

The mayors idea is to install PPPS stations at some intersections. The officers in a station can
patrol all the streets that enter the intersection where the station is, and only those. To achieve maximal
security every street should be patrolled. That is, there must be a PPPS station at one of the two ends
of every street. However, in the past, there were unfortunate incidents where two police patrols fought
with each other in dark streets, because they could not recognize that they were both from the police.
To avoid such untimely incidents, there cannot be PPPS stations at both ends of a street. Finally, as
PPPS stations are very expensive and as the mayor is not willing to increase taxes, one should build as
few PPPS stations as possible.

Write a program that determines whether it is possible to design such a Perfect Police Patrol System.
If so, the program should output the minimal number of stations that have to be built.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases, each of them consists of lines of integers. The first line contains
two integers n and m (1  n  1000, 1  m  10000) where integer n is the number of intersections
and integer m is the number of streets. The next m lines describe the m streets. Each of theses lines
contains two integers that identify the two intersections at the two ends of the streets (intersections
are numbered 1, 2, . . . , n). Because of the various tunnels, bridges, temporarily closed streets etc. you
cannot assume anything about the topology of the city.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output contains one single line. If the PPPS can be designed, then the program
should output one integer, the minimal number of PPPS stations required. Otherwise, if no PPPS can
be designed, the program should output the line Impossible (without quotes).
