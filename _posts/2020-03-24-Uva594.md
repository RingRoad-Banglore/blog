## Input

```text
Writing programs that are completely portable across different operating systems, operating system
versions and hardware platforms is a challenging task. One of the difficulties encountered is a result of
decisions made by hardware manufacturers about how they will store integer data in memory. Because
these representations can differ from machine to machine, sharing binary data often cannot be done
without modifying the way in which the data is stored or the way in which it is handled by one or more
of the platforms.

Fortunately there is near-universal agreement among hardware manufacturers that addressable
memory be ordered into 8-bit bytes. For integer data values that require more than 8-bits, such
as the typical 2- byte, 4-byte, and 8-byte integer types available on most modern hardware, there is
no such agreement and two incompatible storage schemes exist. The first stores integers as groups of
consecutive 8-bit bytes with the least significant byte occupying the lowest memory location within the
group and the most significant byte occupying the highest memory location. The second is just the
reverse; the least significant byte is stored in the highest memory location within the group, and the
most significant byte is stored in the lowest memory location. The computing industry has dubbed
these schemes Little Endian and Big Endian, respectively. There is also near-universal agreement that
signed integers are stored using twos complement representation, and you may assume that this is
the case.

When binary integer data is shared between a Little Endian and Big Endian machine, a data
conversion must be performed which involves reversing the bytes of the data. Once the bytes have
been reversed the integer is then correctly interpreted by the hardware as the original value from the
opposite-endian machine. The object of this problem is to write a program that will read a list of
integers and report the integers that the binary representations of the input integers would represent
on an opposite-endian machine.

## Output

```text
The input will consist of a list integers. The end of the input file marks the end of the list. All input
integers can be represented as a 32-bit signed integer value. That is, the input integers will be in the
range -2147483648 to 2147483647.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input integer a single line should be printed to the output file. The line should contain the
input integer followed by the phrase converts to followed by one space followed the other-endian
value.

```

## Sample Output
