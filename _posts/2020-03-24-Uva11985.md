title: Uva 11985  Prime Independence
---


```
A set of integers is called prime independent if none of its member is a prime multiple of another
member. An integer a is said to be a prime multiple of b if,

a = b k (where k is a prime [1])

So, 6 is a prime multiple of 2, but 8 is not. And for example, {2, 8, 17} is prime independent but
{2, 8, 16} or {3, 6} are not.

Now, given a set of distinct positive integers, calculate the largest prime independent subset.
```

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 25), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with an integer N (1  N  40000) denoting the size of the set. Next line contains
N integers separated by a single space. Each of these N integers are distinct and between 1 and 500000
inclusive.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the case number and the size of the largest prime independent subset.

Notes:
1. An integer is said to be a prime if its divisible by exactly two distinct integers. First few prime

numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...

```

## Sample Input

```
3
5
2 4 8 16 32
5
2 3 4 6 9
3
1 2 3

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 3
Case 3: 2
```
