title: Uva 12236  In A Crazy City
---


```
I live in a crazy city full of crossings and bidirectional roads connecting them. On most of the days,
there will be a celebration in one of the crossings, thats why I call this city crazy.

Everyday, I walk from my home (at crossing s) to my office (at crossing t). I dont like crowds, but
I dont want to waste time either, so I always choose a shortest path among all possible paths that does
not visit the crossing of the celebration. If no such path exists, I dont go to work (its a good excuse,
isnt it)!

In order to analyze this celebration effect in detail, I need n pairs of values (li, ci), where li is
the length of the shortest path from crossing s to crossing t, not visiting crossing i, ci is the number
of such shortest paths (not visiting crossing i). Could you help me? Note that if I cant go to work
when celebration is held at crossing i, define li = ci = 0. This includes the case when there is no path
between s and t even if theres no celebration at all.

Ah, wait a moment. Please dont directly give me the values - thatll drive me crazy (too many
numbers!). All I need is finding some interesting conclusions behind the values, but currently Ive no
idea what exactly I want.

Before I know what you should calculate, please prove that you can indeed find all the pairs (li, ci) by
telling me the value of f(x) = (l1+c1x+l2x2+c2x3+l3x4+c3x5+. . .+lnx2n2+cnx2n1) mod 19880830,
for some given x.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each case begins with 5 integers n,m, s, t, q (1  s, t  n 
100, 000, 0  m  500, 000, 1  q  5). n is the number of crossings, m is the number of roads and q
is the number of queries. s and t are different integers that represent my home and office, respectively.
Each of the following m lines describes a road with three integers: u, v, w (1  u, v  n, 1  w  10, 000),
indicating a bidirectional road connecting crossing u and crossing v, with length w. There may be
multiple roads connecting the same pair of crossings, but a road cannot be connecting a crossing and
itself. The next line contains q integers xi (1  xi  109). The last test case is following by five zeros,
which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and q integers f(x1), f(x2), . . . , f(xq) separated by a single
space between consecutive items, on one line.

Print a blank line after the output of each test case.

Explanation:
In the first sample, l1 = c1 = 0, l2 = 4, c2 = 2, l3 = 3, c3 = 1, l4 = c4 = 0. In the second sample,

everything is zero.
