---


## Input

```

You are given an integer sequence of length N and another value X. You have to find a contiguous
subsequence of the given sequence such that the sum is greater or equal to X. And you have to find
that segment with minimal length.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input file contains T the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line
containing 2 integers N (1  N  500000) and X (109  X  109). Next line contains N integers
denoting the elements of the sequence. These integers will be between 109 to 109 inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output the minimum length of the sub array whose sum is greater or equal to X. If
there is no such array, output -1.
