title: Uva 01504  Genghis Khan the Conqueror

## Input

```

Genghis Khan( )(1162-1227), also known by his birth name Temujin( ) and temple name

Taizu( ), was the founder of the Mongol Empire and the greatest conqueror in Chinese history.
After uniting many of the nomadic tribes on the Mongolian steppe, Genghis Khan founded a strong
cavalry equipped by irony discipline, sabers and powder, and he became to the most fearsome conqueror
in the history. He stretched the empire that resulted in the conquest of most of Eurasia. The following
figure (origin: Wikipedia) shows the territory of Mongol Empire at that time.

Our story is about Jebei Noyan( ), who was one of the most famous generals in Genghis Khans
cavalry. Once his led the advance troop to invade a country named Pushtuar. The knights rolled up
all the cities in Pushtuar rapidly. As Jebei Noyans advance troop did not have enough soldiers, the
conquest was temporary and vulnerable and he was waiting for the Genghis Khans reinforce. At the
meantime, Jebei Noyan needed to set up many guarders on the road of the country in order to guarantee
that his troop in each city can send and receive messages safely and promptly through those roads.

There were N cities in Pushtuar and there were bidirectional roads connecting cities. If Jebei set
upguarders on a road, it was totally safe to deliver messages between the two cities connected by the
road. However setting up guarders on different road took different cost based on the distance, road
condition and the residual armed power nearby. Jebei had known the cost of setting up guarders on
each road. He wanted to guarantee that each two cities can safely deliver messages either directly or
indirectly and the total cost was minimal.

Things will always get a little bit harder. As a sophisticated general, Jebei predicted that there
would be one uprising happening in the country sooner or later which might increase the cost (setting
up guarders) on exactly ONE road. Nevertheless he did not know which road would be affected, but
only got the information of some suspicious road cost changes. We assumed that the probability of each
suspicious case was the same. Since that after the uprising happened, the plan of guarder setting should
be rearranged to achieve the minimal cost, Jebei Noyan wanted to know the new expected minimal
total cost immediately based on current information.

## Output

```
There are no more than 20 test cases in the input.
For each test case, the first line contains two integers N and M (1  N  3000, 0  M  N N),

demonstrating the number of cities and roads in Pushtuar. Cities are numbered from 0 to N  1. In
the each of the following M lines, there are three integers xi, yi and ci (ci  107), showing that there
is a bidirectional road between xi and yi, while the cost of setting up guarders on this road is ci. We
guarantee that the graph is connected. The total cost of the graph is less or equal to 109.

The next line contains an integer Q (1  Q  10000) representing the number of suspicious road
cost changes. In the following Q lines, each line contains three integers Xi, Yi and Ci showing that
the cost of road (Xi, Yi) may change to Ci (Ci  107). We guarantee that the road always exists and
Ci is larger than the original cost (we guarantee that there is at most one road connecting two cities
directly). Please note that the probability of each suspicious road cost change is the same.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a real number demonstrating the expected minimal total cost. The result
should be rounded to 4 digits after decimal point.

Hint: The initial minimal cost is 5 by connecting city 0 to 1 and city 0 to 2. In the first suspicious
case, the minimal total cost is increased to 6; the second case remains 5; the third case is increased to
7. As the result, the expected cost is (5+6+7)/3 = 6.
