## Input

This is a two player game. Initially there are n integer numbers in an array and players A and B get
chance to take them alternatively. Each player can take one or more numbers from the left or right end
of the array but cannot take from both ends at a time. He can take as many consecutive numbers as he
wants during his time. The game ends when all numbers are taken from the array by the players. The
point of each player is calculated by the summation of the numbers, which he has taken. Each player
tries to achieve more points from other. If both players play optimally and player A starts the game
then how much more point can player A get than player B?
