title: Uva 12604  Caesar cipher
---


## Input

```text
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesars ci-
pher, the shift cipher, Caesars code or Caesar shift, is one
of the simplest and most widely known encryption tech-
niques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each
letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed
number of positions down the alphabet (wrapping around
in the end). For example, given an alphabet of capital let-
ters in usual order, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by
D, B would become E, and so on, with Z being replaced by
C. The method is named after Julius C Caesar, who used it
in his private correspondence.

We are given an alphabet A, a string S which is en-
crypted using a shift cipher and a plaintext word W .

Find the possible values of shifts (in the range [0, |A| 
1]) used in encryption if we know that the unencrypted text contains exactly one occurrence of the
word W .
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer N on a line, the number of test cases. Each cases contains three strings
on separate lines, alphabet A, plaintext word W and encrypted text S. Alphabet A will contain only
letters and digits ([A-Z][a-z][0-9]) and its symbol order is not necessarily lexicographical (see the
third sample case). A will not contain duplicate symbols. The constraints are as given: 3  |A|  62,
1  |W |  50, 000, 3  |S|  500, 000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print one line of output.

If there are no shifts that would satisfy the condition of W being a part of the unencrypted S, print
no solution.

If there is exactly one shift that could have been used, print unique: # where # is the shift value.
It there are more than one possible shifts print ambiguous:  followed by the sorted list of shift

values.

For clarification, see the sample output.
