---


```
A palindorme is a sequence of one or more characters that reads the same from the left as it does from
the right. For example, Z, TOT and MADAM are palindromes, but ADAM is not.

Given a sequence S of N capital latin letters. How many ways can one score out a few symbols
(maybe 0) that the rest of sequence become a palidrome. Varints that are only different by an order of
scoring out should be considered the same.
```

## Input

```

indicates how many test cases are to follow.

Each of the T lines contains a sequence S (1  N  60). So actually each of these lines is a test
case.

```

## Output

For each test case output in a single line an integer  the number of ways.
