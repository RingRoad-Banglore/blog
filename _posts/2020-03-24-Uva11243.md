title: Uva 11243  Texas Trip
---


```
After a day trip with his friend Dick,
Harry noticed a strange pattern of tiny
holes in the door of his SUV. The local
American Tire store sells fiberglass patch-
ing material only in square sheets. What
is the smallest patch that Harry needs to
fix his door?

Assume that the holes are points on
the integer lattice in the plane. Your job
is to find the area of the smallest square
that will cover all the holes.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input contains a single integer T expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes, denoting
the number of test cases to follow. The subsequent lines of input describe the test cases.

Each test case begins with a single line, containing a single integer n expressed in decimal with no
leading zeroes, the number of points to follow; each of the following n lines contains two integers x and
y, both expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes, giving the coordinates of one of your points.

You are guaranteed that T  30 and that no data set containsmore than 30 points. All points in
each data set will be no more than 500 units away from (0,0).

```

## Output

```
Print, on a single line with two decimal places of precision, the area of the smallest square containing
all of your points. An answer will be accepted if it lies within 0.1 of the correct answer.
