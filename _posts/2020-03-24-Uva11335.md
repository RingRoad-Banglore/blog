title: Uva 11335  Discrete Pursuit
---


## Input

```
Robocops Inc. is a toy manufacturer company that develops a robot game in which a cop tries to
catch a thief in a field that is simulated with a rectangular grid whose coordinates are denoted by pairs
of integers. The resulting pursuit occurs in a discrete time scale: time is modeled with non-negative
integers 0, 1, 2, . . ..

An object on the grid has a speed that determines how the object moves during the simulation. A
speed is modeled with a pair of integers. The first one is the horizontal speed and the second one is the
vertical speed. Additionally, horizontal and vertical speeds may vary in one unit (each one) to simulate
slowing or accelerating.

More exactly: if at time k the object is at location (x, y) with speed (u, v), then, at time k+ 1, the
object may appear at location (x, y) = (x + u + , y + v + ), for some ,   {1, 0, 1}. The speed
at time k + 1 is (x  x, y  y). For an object that moves with constant speed the values  and  are
always 0.

At time 0, the cop is located at the origin of the grid, and the thief is at coordinates (a, 0). The
thief is moving with a constant speed; on the other hand, the cop starts still, but may vary his speed
according to the given rules. Clearly, the cop catches the thief at time k if at this time the positions of
both coincide.

Your task is to develop a program to control the cop in order to catch the thief in an efficient way.
Your algorithm should determine the minimum time in which the cop may catch the thief.

## Output

```
The problem input consists of several cases, each one defined by a line with three integer values,
separated by blanks, that stand for the initial position a of the thief in the X-axis (0  a  1000), the
horizontal speed u (0  u  10) and the vertical speed v (0  v  10) at which he moves. The end of
the input corresponds to the end of the input file.
