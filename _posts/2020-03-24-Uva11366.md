## Input

```text
The three friends Alice, Bob, and Cynthia always seem to get in situa-
tions where there are debts to be cleared among themselves. Of course,
this is the price of hanging out a lot: it only takes a few resturant
visits, movies, and drink rounds to get an unsettled balance. So when
they meet as usual every Friday afternoon they begin their evening
by clearing last weeks debts. To satisfy their mathematically inclined
minds they prefer clearing their debts using as little money transaction
as possible, i.e. by exchanging as few bank notes and coins as neces-
sary. To their surprise, this can sometimes by harder than it sounds.
Suppose that Alice owes Bob 10 crowns and this is the three friends
only uncleared debt, and Alice has a 50 crown note but nothing smaller, Bob has three 10 crown coins
and ten 1 crown coins, and Cynthia has three 20 crown notes. The best way to clear the debt is for
Alice to give her 50 crown note to Cynthia, Cynthia to give two 20 crown notes to Alice and one to
Bob, and Bob to give one 10 crown coin to Cynthia, involving a total of only five notes/coins changing
owners. Compare this to the straightforward solution of Alice giving her 50 crown note to Bob and
getting Bobs three 10 crown notes and all his 1 crown coins for a total of fourteen notes/coins being
exchanged!

## Output

```text
On the first line of input is a single positive integer, 1  t  50, specifying the number of test cases to
follow. Each test case begins with three integers ab, bc, ca  1000 on a line of itself. ab is the amount
Alice owes Bob (negative if it is Bob who owes Alice money), bc the amount Bob owes Cynthia (negative
if it is Cynthia who is in debt to Bob), and ca the amount Cynthia owes Alice (negative if it is Alice
who owes Cynthia).

Next follow three lines each with six non-negative integers a100, a50, a20, a10, a5, a1, b100, . . . , b1, and
c100, . . . , c1, respectively, where a100 is the number of 100 crown notes Alice got, a50 is the number of
her 50 crown notes, and so on. Likewise, b100, . . . , b1 is the amount of notes/coins of different value Bob
got, and c100, . . . , c1 describes Cynthias money. Each of them has at most 30 coins (i.e. a10 + a5 + a1,
b10 + b5 + b1, and c10 + c5 + c1 are all less than or equal to 30) and the total amount of all their money
together (Alices plus Bobs plus Cynthias) is always less than 1000 crowns.
