title: Uva 12853  The Pony Cart Problem
---


## Input

```

What is the circumference of the outer track?

While driving a speedy pony, a young boy went around
a sharp turn at a gait which threatened an upset to the
pony cart, as well as to his fathers nerves. Fortunately
no accidents occurred, and after some experimentation, the
following information was gathered:

In turning the pony cart around within a ring of a cer-
tain diameter, which might be said to be reasonably safe,
it was found that the outer wheels made two turns to the
inner wheels one; the wheels were fxed at the statutory dis-
tance of fve feet apart on the axletree. The problem is to
guess the circumference of the track described by the outer
wheels in making the turn.

Assume that the tracks marked on the foor are perfectly circular, that the distance between a wheel
on one side and its opposite on the other side is D feet, and that for one turn of the inner wheels, the
outer wheels make N turns. Determine the circumference of the circle formed by the outer wheels.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases.

Each test case is described by the two real numbers D and N in the same line. These numbers are
always given with two digits after the decimal point.

T  1000; 3  D  10; 1 < N  10

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the circumference of the outer tracks (in feet),
with exactly three digits after the decimal point.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
5.00 2.00
4.20 1.44
8.03 2.01
