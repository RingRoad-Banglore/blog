title: Uva 10119  Farewell my friend
---


```
Liz and Lilly used to be very good friends, but recently, they got into a silly quarrel and finally decided
to say farewell to each other. I dont want to see you any more! I must put some new rocks somewhere
so that no matter how I travel from my house, I can never see your face. They both said.

They live in a small village which is divided into n n grid. Liz always lives in the top-left corner
(i.e grid(1, 1)), and Lilly always lives in the bottom-right corner. (i.e grid(n, n)). Each grid of land is
one of the following types: land, lake or rock. They cannot move across a rock or a lake, of course.
And although people cannot see through a rock, its easy for them to see through a piece of land or
a lake. Note that they can only move north, south, east or west one grid at a time, NOT diagonally,
and they are a bit shortsighted - they can only see things that are no more than k grids away in front
of them (in the same row or column. They dont see anything diagonally).

Since theyre both lazy, they want to put as few new rocks as possible. A new rock can only be put
on a piece of land that at least one of the two girls can reach from her house. Note that they dont want
to put new rocks too close to their houses, so the new rocks must be at least m grids away from both of
the houses. By definition, grid(x1, y1) and grid(x2, y2) are supposed to be abs(x1  x2) + abs(y1  y2)
grids away from each other.
```

## Input

```
The input will contain no more than 8 test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing three
integers n, k and m(5  n  20, 1  k  n, 1  m  n) separated by a single space. The following n
lines each contains n characters indicating the map of a village. The capital letter O represents a lake,
* represents a rock ,. represents a piece of land. The test case containing n = 0, k = 0, m = 0 will
terminate the input, you should not give an answer to this case. No extra spaces at the beginning/end
of each line.

```

## Output

```
Output the least number of new rocks that must be put in order to separate them. Print your answer
in a single line for each test case. If no solution found, you should output -1 in the corresponding line.

Note:
If they only set one new rock at (4,3), when Liz comes to (2,6) and Lilly comes to (5,6), they can

still see each other. Thus, an additional rock at (2,6) must be put. The new map is shown below: (N
represents a new rock)
