title: Uva 01224  Tile Code
---


## Input

```text

The city of Songpa is now carrying out a project to build a bicycle transportation system called green
Songpa. By the end of this year, citizens and visitors alike will be able to pick up and drop off bicycles
throughout the city. Recently, it was decided to attach a number tag to each bicycle for management
use. The bicycles will be under control of the citys traffic system.

The number tag contains a tile code of length n, which consists of 12, 21, and 22 tiles placed
on a 2  n rectangular plate in a way that every cell of the plate is covered by exactly one tile. The
plate is divided into 2n cells of size 11. Of course, no two tiles are allowed to overlap each other. The
2 5 plate and a tile code of length 5 are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The code will always
be read from left to right. However, there is no distinction between the top side and the bottom side
of the code. The code may be turned upside down. The code shown in Figure 3 is essentially the same
code as in Figure 2.

Given a positive integer n, the project director Dr. Yang wants to know how many tile codes of
length n there are, that is, the number of ways to place the three kinds of tiles into a 2n rectangular
plate subject to the above conditions. Write a program that can help him.
