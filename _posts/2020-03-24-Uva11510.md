title: Uva 11510  Erdos Unit Fractions
---


## Input

```

A unit fraction has the form 1
k
where k is a positive integer.

In 1800 B.C., egyptian mathematicians represented rational numbers between 0 (exclusive) and 1
(inclusive) as finite sums of the form

1

k1
+ . . .+

1

kn
,

where all the denominators were distinct positive integers.

In 1948 A.C., Paul Erdos and Ernst G. Straus formulated the following conjecture about the unit
fractions: for all positive integer n  2, the rational fraction 4/n can be expressed as the sum of three
unit fractions. In other words, it is believed that for each n greater than 1, there exist positive integers
x, y and z such that

4

n
=

1

x
+

1

y
+

1

z

The conjecture has been tested for all n < 1014. It remains unknown if the conjecture is a theorem
or not.

Given an integer n  2, your job is to find three positive integers x, y, z whose values verify the
Erdos-Straus conjecture.

## Output

```
The problem input consists of several cases, each one defined in a line that contains an integer number
n such that (2  n < 104).

A line with n = 0 indicates the end of the input.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case in the input, you must print a line with numbers x, y and z (separated by spaces) such
that 4

n
= 1

x
+ 1

y
+ 1

z
and 0 < x, y, z < 1016.

You can print any solution. Its guaranteed that every case in the input has a solution such that
0 < x, y, z < 1016.
