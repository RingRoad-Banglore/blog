title: Uva 01475  Jungle Outpost
---


```

There is a military base lost deep in the jungle. It is surrounded by n watchtowers with ultrasonic
generators. In this problem watchtowers are represented by points on a plane.

Watchtowers generate ultrasonic field and protect all objects that are strictly inside the towers
convex hull. There is no tower strictly inside the convex hull and no three towers are on a straight line.

The enemy can blow up some towers. If this happens, the protected area is reduced to a convex
hull of the remaining towers.

The base commander wants to build headquarters inside the protected area. In order to increase
its security, he wants to maximize the number of towers that the enemy needs to blow up to make the
headquarters unprotected.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
The first line of each one of the cases contains a single integer n (3  n  50000)  the number of

watchtowers. The next n lines of the input file contain the Cartesian coordinates of watchtowers, one
pair of coordinates per line. Coordinates are integer and do not exceed 106 by absolute value. Towers
are listed in the order of traversal of their convex hull in clockwise direction.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, write to the output file the number of watchtowers the enemy has to blow up to
compromise headquarters protection if the headquarters are placed optimally.
