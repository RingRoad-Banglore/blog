title: Uva 12065  Permutation Primes
---


## Input

```
Permutations of a sequence of decimal digits have an
interesting property. Any two permutations of a se-
quence of digits have a difference, which is divisible
by 9. Quite interesting, isnt it? For example:

|458967 456879| = 2088 = 9  232

We wont ask for the proof today (as it is very
easy) but we will focus towards a different aspect of
this property. There are some numbers whose differ-
ence with one (or more) of its permutation is of the
form 9p, where p is a prime less than 1111111. These
numbers are called permutation primes. For example
92-29=63=9*7, where 7 is a prime. So 92 is a per-
mutation prime. Now you have to write a program that finds out how many permutation primes are
there within a specified range.
```

## Output

```
First line of input contains an integer T (0 < T < 51) denoting the number of test cases to follow.
Then follows T lines each of which contains two positive integers p and q. Both of them are less than
99999999, without any leading zero(s) and |p q|  1000.

```

## Sample Input

```
There will be one line of output for each test case. At first print Case i:  (without the quotes) where
i is an integer denoting the i-th test case starting from one. Then the line will contain an integer N
that denotes the number of permutation primes between p and q (inclusive).
