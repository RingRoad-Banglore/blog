## Input

```text
AS (Association for Strings) is an organization which represents strings in different manner. They
used to provide different rules concerning string representation. Their service is needed in a country
named Bangladesh. Elora, the current chief of the country ask for a rule to AS. AS provides the rule
and now Elora is worried about whether the rule is valid or not, if it is valid she also wants to know
the lexicographically smallest string which can be represented by the rule. So, she wants to hire a
programmer who will do the job for her.

A suffix of a string X is a string obtained by removing zero or more character(s) from the
beginning of that string. A prefix of a string X is a string obtained by removing zero or more
character(s) from the end of X. A proper prefix/suffix of X is a prefix/suffix with length strictly less
than X.

AS provided the rule as an array P of length N . A string S of length N can be represented by P .

The rule is:
P [k] = length of the longest prefix of S[1 . . . k] which is proper suffix of S[1 . . . k]. S[1 . . . k] denotes

the k-length prefix of S.
Strings are composed of lowercase letters from a to q.

Example:
N = 5, P = {0, 0, 1, 2, 3}, S = ababa
P [4] is 2 because ab is the longest prefix of S[1 . . . 4] which is also a suffix of it.

You have to check if any string S can be generated from P . If it is possible to generate a string S
from P then you have to output lexicographically smallest S otherwise output -1 (quotes for clarity).
Please read sample input and output for more clarification.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains number of test cases, T . (1  T  15). For each test case the first line contains
N (1  N  100000) which is the length of P and the second line contains N integers separated by
space where the i-th integer is P [i].

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print a line of the form Case < x >: < y >, where x is the case number and y is the
answer.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
6
0 0 1 2 0 0
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
6
0 1 2 3 3 4
