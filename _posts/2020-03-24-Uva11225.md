## Input

```text
A hand in the game oftarot Tarot is a card game played
in France. It is played with a 78-card deck, composed with
21 trump cards (named one, two, ..., twenty-one), a special
card (named the fool) and four suits (spades, hearts, dia-
monds, clubs). Each suit has fourteen cards: ten pip cards
(ace, two, . . ., ten), and four face cards: jack, knight, queen
and king.

Three cards have a special status. They are called the
oudlers and are the fool, the 1 of trumps and the 21 of
trumps.

The game is composed of a bidding phase, followed by
a main phase. The bidding phase consists in choosing one
of the players as the "taker". In the main phase, the players play tricks and try to win as many cards
as possible. The outcome of a game is determined by the number of points won by the taker, which is
the sum of the values of the cards won by the taker. The value that the taker needs to achieve depends
on the number of oudlers he has won throughout the game:

 3 oudlers: 36 points,

 2 oudlers: 41 points,

 1 oudlers: 51 points,

 no oudlers: 56 points,

The value of each card is as follows:

 kings and oudlers: 41
2

points,

 queens: 31
2

points,

 knights: 21
2

points,

 jacks: 11
2

points,

 all other cards: 1
2

point.

For instance, imagine that, at the end of the game, the taker has won the following four cards: ace
of spades, eight of diamonds, fool and twenty-one of trumps. Two of these cards are oudlers, so the
number of points that the taker needs to score to win is 41. However the sum of the points earned is
only 10, and the taker has lost, since the total is 31 points short of the required total.

You have to write a program that, given the list of cards won by the taker, indicates if the taker
has won her bid, and the number of points she has in excess, or lost and the number of missing points.
