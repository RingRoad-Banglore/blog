---


## Input

```text
Write a program that finds and displays all pairs of 5-digit numbers that between them use the digits 0
through 9 once each, such that the first number divided by the second is equal to an integer N , where
2  N  79. That is,

abcde

fghij
= N

where each letter represents a different digit. The first digit of one of the numerals is allowed to be
zero.
```

## Output

```text
Each line of the input file consists of a valid integer N . An input of zero is to terminate the program.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Your program have to display ALL qualifying pairs of numerals, sorted by increasing numerator (and,
of course, denominator).

Your output should be in the following general form:

xxxxx / xxxxx = N
xxxxx / xxxxx = N
.
.

In case there are no pairs of numerals satisfying the condition, you must write There are no
solutions for N.. Separate the output for two different values of N by a blank line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
61
62
0
