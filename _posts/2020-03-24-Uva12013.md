## Input

```
Maryanna and Lucyanna play tennis every Sunday afternoon during 10 years ago.

A tennis match is determined through 5 sets. Typically the first player to win 3 sets wins the match.
A set consists of games, and games, in turn, consist of points.

A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the
first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three
points are described as love, fifteen, thirty, and forty respectively. If at least three points have
been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is deuce. If at least three points have
been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is
advantage for the player in the lead. During informal games, advantage can also be called ad in
or ad out, depending on whether the serving player or receiving player is ahead, respectively.

A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when
the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six
games and at least two games more than the opponent.

The first servers of two consecutive sets are different.
Maryanna has found out when she is the server, her winning probability of this point is M%;

otherwise, Y %. She wants to know her winning probability of the whole match if she serves first.
