Diana is going to write a list of all positive integers between A and B, inclusive, in base 10 and without
any leading zeros. She wants to know how many times each digit is going to be used.
```

## Input

```
Each test case is given in a single line that contains two integers A and B (1  A  B  108). The last
test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output a single line with 10 integers representing the number of times each digit is
used when writing all integers between A and B, inclusive, in base 10 and without leading zeros. Write
the counter for each digit in increasing order from 0 to 9.

```
