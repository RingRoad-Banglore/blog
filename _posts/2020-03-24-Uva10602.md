## Input

```
Company Macrohard has released its new version of editor Nottoobad, which can understand a few
voice commands. Unfortunately, there are only two voice commands that it can understand  repeat
the last word, delete the last symbol. However, when one uses repeat the last word the editor
inserts a blank that separates the words. But the company claims that it is possible to type much faster
 simply by less number of presses. For example, such a phrase like this thin thing requires only 6
presses of the keyboard.

Action Number of presses Content of the document
Press this 4 This
Say repeat the last word 0 this this
Say delete the last symbol 0 this thi
Press n 1 this thin
Say repeat the last word 0 this thin thin
Press g 1 this thin thing

In order to increase the popularity of its product the company decided to organize a contest where
the winner will be a person who types a given number of words with minimum number of presses.
Moreover, the first word must be typed first, and all the others can be typed in arbitrary order. So,
if words apple, plum and apricote must be typed, the word apple must be typed first, and
the words plum and apricote can be switched. And the most important for you  you are going
to take part in the contest and you have a good friend in the company, who told you the word which
will be used in the contest. You want be a winner J, so you have to write a program which finds the
order of the words, where the number of presses will be minimum.
