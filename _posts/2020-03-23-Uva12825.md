12825 Happy Robot

A robot is moving from (0,0) according to a command sequence. Each character in the sequence is
command:

• L: turn left

• R: turn right

• F: go forward one step

Interestingly, the command sequence contains some wildcard character ‘?’. The robot can treat it
any one of L, R or F at its own wish, which makes it really happy.

Let (x, y) be the final position of the robot, your task is to find out the minimal/maximal possible
value of x and y. Initially the robot is facing east (i.e. facing (1,0) in Cartesian coordinate system).
After a left turn it will face north (i.e. facing (0,1)).

## Input

There will be at most 1000 test cases. Each case contains a command sequence with no more than 1000
characters.

## Output

For each test case, print the case number, followed by minimal/maximal possible x (in this order), then
the minimal/maximal possible y.

## Sample Input
<p></p><p>F?F</p><p></p><p>L??</p><p></p><p>LFFFRF</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p></p><p>Case 1: 1 3 -1 1</p><p></p><p>Case 2: -1 1 0 2</p><p></p><p>Case 3: 1 1 3 3</p>
