title: Uva 11230  Annoying painting tool
---


## Input

```
Maybe you wonder what an annoying painting tool is? First of all, the painting tool we speak of
supports only black and white. Therefore, a picture consists of a rectangular area of pixels, which are
either black or white. Second, there is only one operation how to change the colour of pixels:

Select a rectangular area of r rows and c columns of pixels, which is completely inside the picture.
As a result of the operation, each pixel inside the selected rectangle changes its colour (from black to
white, or from white to black).

Initially, all pixels are white. To create a picture, the operation described above can be applied
several times. Can you paint a certain picture which you have in mind?
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with one line containing four integers n, m,
r and c. (1  r  n  100, 1  c  m  100), The following n lines each describe one row of pixels
of the painting you want to create. The i-th line consists of m characters describing the desired pixel
values of the i-th row in the finished painting (0 indicates white, 1 indicates black).

The last test case is followed by a line containing four zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed to create the painting, or -1 if it
is impossible.
