title: Uva 11353  A Different kind of Sorting
---


```
Whenever we think of sorting integers, we tend to think of sorting them in ascending or descending
order. However, we can play around a bit and define new sorting criteria. One criterion could be sorting
numbers in terms of their summation of digits. Therefore in this sorting criterion, 13 would come before
9 as sum of the digits of 13 is 4 and that of 9 is 9.

In this problem, we are concerned with sorting numbers in the range 1 to 2000000 with the following
sorting criteria. Numbers in this range must be sorted in terms of the number of factors in their prime
factorization. Incase of a tie, the smaller number will come first. For example, 20 = 2  2  5, so it
has 3 numbers in its prime factorization. Similarly 35 = 5  7 has 2 numbers in its prime factorization.
Therefore, 35 will come before 20 according to this criterion.

## Input

```
Each case of input will consist of a positive integer n  2000000. The last case is followed by a 0.

Total number of test cases can be as large as 10000.

```

## Output

```
For each case of input, there will be one line of output. It will consist of the case number followed by
the n-th number in the range 1 to 2000000 after the sorting rule has been applied. Look at sample
output for further clarification.
