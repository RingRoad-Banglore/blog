```
We know, if we want to check whether a decimal number is divisible by 3, we need to find the sum of
digits of that number. If the sum is divisible by 3, then the original number will also be divisible by 3.

It took me a while to prove this. And then I realized this is true not only for 3 but for some other
numbers as well. Sometimes not only for decimals but also for numbers in other bases as well. Can
you find them?

In particular, given a particular divisor D, you will have to find how many valid different bases B,
less or equal to BMAX, are possible such that when we represent any number N in base B and the
sum of digits of N is S, the following implication is true:

N is divisible by D IF AND ONLY IF S is divisible by D.

For example, if BMAX = 10, D = 3, the answer is 3. The bases are 4, 7 and 10.
```

## Input

```
First line will contain T (T  10000), no of test cases. T lines will follow each with two integers BMAX
(2  BMAX  1018) and D (1  D  1018). You can assume that base of a number system is positive
and not less than 2.

```

## Output

```
For each case print one line, Case C: A, where C is the case no and A is the required answer. Look
at the output for sample input for details.

## Sample Input

## Sample Output
