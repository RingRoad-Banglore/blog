title: Uva 13086  Pirates of the Mega Ocean
---


## Input

```
There are N island in the Mega Ocean. Ai is the number of people lived in island i. However, all islands
are discrete from each other. There is no road transport system between the islands. Though they can
travel each other by ship and boats, it is risky as the Pirates of the Mega Ocean create problems like
kidnapping, demanding ransom, killing etc.

To get rid of this problem permanently, the governments of all these islands decided to make low
cost two way tunnels between islands, so that they can visit each other without ship or boats and
avoid getting in touch of Pirates of the Mega Ocean. However, the Pirates of the Mega Ocean got the
information of tunnel building and sent a letter for all the Government chiefs demanding token money
to let the governments building tunnels.

According to the letter, the governments have to pay Ax Ay amount of gold coins to build a tunnel
between island x and island y. As the Pirates will not disturb anyone again if they get the money, the
governments decided to pay the money. However, the governments of those islands want to spend as
less as possible against the pirates. So they decided to build some tunnels in such a way that these
tunnels connect all the islands (anyone can travel from any island to another through these tunnels)
and the total money given to the pirates is as minimum as possible.

However, there is another problem. Some islands are so small that it is impossible to connect more
than one tunnel with the island.

Given N , A and set of small island S, you have to find the minimum total gold coin you have to
give to the pirates to build those tunnels, such that all the islands are connected and small islands are
connected to at most one tunnel.

## Output

```
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T  200), the number of test cases. First line of
each test case contains two integer numbers N and M (1  N  105 and 0  M < N), denoting the
number of island and the number of small islands respectively. Next line contains six integer numbers
P , Q, R, X, Y and Z (0  P,Q,R,X, Y, Z  105). You have to calculate the number of people Ai for
each island using the following equation:

Ai = (P  i2 +Q i+R)%1000007, 1  i  N

Similarly, you have to calculate S, the set of small island as follows:

Si = (X  i2 + Y  i+ Z)%N + 1, 1  i  M

Note that, there can be duplicity in the small island set S.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the test case number followed by the answer.

Explanation:
For both of the cases, A1 = 3, A2 = 7 and A3 = 13.
For the first test case, there is no small island, so if you build tunnels A1A2 and A1A3, then the

total cost will be 7  3 + 3  13 = 60.
For the second test case, the only small island is S1 = 1, so you cant build multiple tunnels with

island 1. If you have to build tunnels A1A2 and A2A3, then the total cost will be 7  3+7  13 = 112.
