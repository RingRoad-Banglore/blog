942 Cyclic Numbers

Given two positive integers, that represent a rational number as a fraction, we want to produce the
decimal periodic representation of the fraction’s value. A decimal periodic representation has the
following form:

d1 . . . di.dj . . . dl(dm . . . dn)

where each d is a decimal digit and the inclusion of dm . . . dn between parenthesis means that this
sequence of digits is repeated forever. We call (dm . . . dn) the periodic part of the representation.

As examples of decimal periodic representations, consider for instance:

1/3 = 0.(3) 13/66 = 0.1(96) 170/12 = 14.1(6) 24/6 = 4.0

Notice that the periodic part is omitted if the decimal expansion of the fraction is finite, as illustrated
by the last example.

All fractions can be represented precisely, in a finite way, using this kind of representation. However
we cannot give an explicit bound for the size of the periodic part (see for example the second fraction
in the sample input below).

## Input

The first line contains a non-negative integer n, which is the number of fractions to convert to the
decimal periodic representation. The following n lines contain two positive integers, respectively the
numerator and the denominator of the fraction to be converted.

## Output

For each fraction in the input, there must be a line in the output containing its decimal periodic
representation.
