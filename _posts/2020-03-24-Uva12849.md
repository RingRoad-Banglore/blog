## Input

```text

Mrs. Hubbards kids inspect the jam

Mrs. Hubbard has invented a clever system for keeping tabs on
her blackberry jam. She flled twenty-fve jars and arranged the
three sizes so as to have twenty quarts on each shelf. Can you
guess her secret so as to tell how much jam is on each type of jar?

As you can see, there are three types of jars, which we will call
small, medium and large. Mrs. Hubbard puts a certain number
of jars on each of her three shelves. If all jars are completely flled
with jam, and you know the total amount of jam in each shelf,
determine the capacity of each type of jar.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number
of test cases.

Each test case begins with a blank line; after that, there will
be three lines describing each shelf.

A shelf is described by four numbers, in order: three integers
S, M , L which represent the number of small, medium and large jars in the shelf, and a real number
J that represents the total amount of jam for that shelf.

The value of J will always be presented with two digits after the decimal point. You may assume
that all test cases have a valid answer.

T  5000; 0  S,M,L  15; 0 < J  100

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the capacity of the small, medium and large jars,
in that order. Print the answers as real numbers rounded to exactly two digits after the decimal point.
