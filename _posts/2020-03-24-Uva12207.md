Your government has finally solved the problem
of universal health care! Now everyone, rich or
poor, will finally have access to the same level
of medical care. Hurrah!

Theres one minor complication. All of the
countrys hospitals have been condensed down
into one location, which can only take care of
one person at a time. But dont worry! There
is also a plan in place for a fair, efficient com-
puterized system to determine who will be ad-
mitted. You are in charge of programming this
system.

Every citizen in the nation will be assigned
a unique number, from 1 to P (where P is the
current population). They will be put into a
queue, with 1 in front of 2, 2 in front of 3, and so on. The hospital will process patients one by one, in
order, from this queue. Once a citizen has been admitted, they will immediately move from the front
of the queue to the back.

Of course, sometimes emergencies arise; if youve just been run over by a steamroller, you cant wait
for half the country to get a routine checkup before you can be treated! So, for these (hopefully rare)
occasions, an expedite command can be given to move one person to the front of the queue. Everyone
elses relative order will remain unchanged.

Given the sequence of processing and expediting commands, output the order in which citizens will
be admitted to the hospital.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of at most ten test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing P , the population
of your country (1  P  1000000000), and C, the number of commands to process (1  C  1000).

The next C lines each contain a command of the form N, indicating the next citizen is to be
admitted, or E x, indicating that citizen x is to be expedited to the front of the queue.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.

```

## Output

```
For each test case print the serial of output. This is followed by one line of output for each N command,
indicating which citizen should be processed next. Look at the output for sample input for details.
