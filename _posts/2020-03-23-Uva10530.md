10530 Guessing Game
Stan and Ollie are playing a guessing game. Stan
thinks of a number between 1 and 10 and Ollie guesses
what the number might be. After each guess, Stan
indicates whether Ollie’s guess is too high, too low,
or right on.

After playing several rounds, Ollie has become
suspicious that Stan cheats; that is, that he changes
the number between Ollie’s guesses. To prepare his
case against Stan, Ollie has recorded a transcript of
several games. You are to determine whether or not
each transcript proves that Stan is cheating.

## Input
Standard input consists of several transcripts. Each
transcript consists of a number of paired guesses and responses. A guess is a line containing single
integer between 1 and 10, and a response is a line containing ‘too high’, ‘too low’, or ‘right on’.
Each game ends with ‘right on’. A line containing ‘0’ follows the last transcript.

## Output
For each game, output a line ‘Stan is dishonest’ if Stan’s responses are inconsistent with the final
guess and response. Otherwise, print ‘Stan may be honest’.

## Sample Input
<p>10</p><p>too high</p><p>3</p><p>too low</p><p>4</p><p>too high</p><p>2</p><p>right on</p><p>5</p><p>too low</p><p>7</p><p>too high</p><p>6</p><p>right on</p><p>0</p><p></p>
