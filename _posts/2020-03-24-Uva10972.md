title: Uva 10972  RevolC FaeLoN
---


## Input

```text
Hopefully, you can remember Koorosh from one of the previous problems. Fortunately, Koorosh has
solved Basms problem without your help! Now, he is a high-ranked advisor of Basm.

As usual, Basm has conquered a new territory, called RevolC FaeLoN. In order to make the people
of RevolC FaeLoN satisfied, he wants to solve one of their basic problems. The RevolC FaeLoN has a
high annual rate of camel accidents and Basm wants to make the roads of this territory unidirectional
in order to reduce the accident rate.

He wants to do this task in such a way that each city has at least one path to every other city.
Now, Basm has asked Koorosh to find the minimum number of unidirectional roads which need to be
constructed (in addition to the task of making the existing roads unidirectional) in order for every city
to be reachable from every other city. Note that the original graph representing the territory is simple
but during the road construction process, extra roads can be constructed between two cities that have
already been connected to each other by a road.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test-cases. Each test case begins with two numbers 1  n  1000 and m which
are the number of cities and roads of RevolC FaeLoN respectively. The next m lines, each contain two
integers 1  u, v  1000, indicating that there is a road between u and v. The input is terminated by
end of file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test-case, print the minimum number of roads that should be constructed to make Basms
decision possible.
