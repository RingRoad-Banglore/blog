## Input

```
We all know about the legend of tower of Hanoi. It is said that the world will end after finishing the
puzzle. What we dont know is another legend about when the world will end which is verified by the
scientists.

It is all about a 3n  3m grid. Initially the grid is filled with 1 to 3(m+n) in row major order. At
each step the puzzle is rearranged by reading it in row major order and putting them in collumn major
order. See the following examples.

1 2 3 1 10 19
4 5 6 2 11 20
7 8 9 3 12 21
10 11 12 4 13 22
13 14 15 to 5 14 23
16 17 18 6 15 24
19 20 21 7 16 25
22 23 24 8 17 26
25 26 27 9 18 27

1 2 3 1 4 7
4 5 6 to 2 5 8
7 8 9 3 6 9

Now every day the puzzle is rearranged once. The legend says if someday initial configuration
returns the world will end. Now you are wondering when the world is going to end.
