title: Uva 11984  A Change in Thermal Unit
---


## Input

```text
Measuring temperature and temperature differences are common task in many research and applica-
tions. Unfortunately, there exists more than one unit of measuring temperatures. This introduces a
lot of confusion at times. Two popular units of measurements are Celsius(C) and Fahrenheit (F ). The
conversion of F from C is given by the formula:

F =
9

5
C + 32

In this problem, you will be given an initial temperature in C and an increase in temperature in F .
You would have to calculate the new temperature in C.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case contains a line with two integers C and d (0  C, d  100), where C represents the initial
temperature in Celsius and d represents the increase in temperature in Fahrenheit.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print the case number and the new temperature in Celsius after rounding it to two digits
after the decimal point.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
100 0
0 100

```
