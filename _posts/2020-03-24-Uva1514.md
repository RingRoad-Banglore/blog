title: Uva 01514  Piece it together
---


## Input

```text

Tom has developed a special kind of puzzle: it involves a whole bunch of identical puzzle pieces. The
pieces have the shape of three adjoint squares in an L-shape. The corner square is black, the two
adjacent squares are white.

A puzzle piece

The puzzler is given a pattern of black and white squares in a rectangular
grid. The challenge is to create that pattern using these pieces. The pieces can
be rotated, but must not overlap.

Tom has already designed a few nice patterns, but he needs to find out if
they can be constructed with the pieces at all. Rather than trying to test this
for each pattern by hand, he wants to write a computer program to determine
this for him. Can you help him?
```

## Output

```text
On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:

 one line with two integers n and m (1  n,m  500): the height and width of the grid containing
the pattern, respectively.

 n lines, each containingm characters, denoting the grid. Each character is B, W, or ., indicating
a black, white or empty square respectively.

The grid contains at least one black or white square.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Per test case:

 one line with either YES or NO, indicating whether or not it is possible to construct the pattern
with the puzzle pieces. You may assume that there is an infinite supply of pieces.
