According to Wikipedia, a magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct
integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the
same constant. This constant is the module of the magic square. There are well-known magic squares
such as the order 3 chinese Lo Shu magic square:

It is allowed to use any collection of n2 integer numbers to build a magic square of order n. The
Passion facade of the Sagrada Famlia church in Barcelona, designed by Josep Subirachs, displays the
magic square of order 4 and module 33 shown in the following figure. Note that, in this example, the
given numbers are not the first n2 integers and that there are repetitions.

Armadora de Cuadrados Magicos (ACM ) is a recently founded enterprise that is interested on
applications of magic squares to cryptography. For that reason, they want to develop software to help
magic square builders in detecting if a given sequence of integer numbers may be arranged in a magic
square. Your task is to help ACM in this task.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases, each one defined by a line containing a sequence of m blank-
separated integers x1, x2, . . ., xm (1  m  16, 103  xi  103 for each 1  i  m).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line with exactly one letter: Y to indicate that a magic square may be
built with the numbers provided for the case, or N otherwise.
