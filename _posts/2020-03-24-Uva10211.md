There are often ways to check (other than brute force division) whether a number is divisible by another
number. As for example

a) In decimal number system a number is divisible by 2 if the rightmost digit is divisible by 2. So
42, 38, 50 are divisible by 2.

b) In decimal number system a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by rightmost two digits
is divisible by 4. So 100, 124, 1328 are divisible by 4.

c) In decimal number system a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So 123
is divisible by 3 as (1+2+3 = 6 = 32). Similar testing is there for divisibility by 9. For divisibility
testing of 99 we need to add up all digits from the right considering two digits as a number. For
example 2374310351037933 divisible by 99 as 33+79+03+51+03+31+74+23 = 297 = 993

d) A number is divisible by 11 if the difference of the sums of its odd positioned digits and even
positioned digits from the right is divisible by 11. As for example 1270401 is divisible by 11, as
(1 0 + 4 0 + 7 2 + 1) = 11, which is divisible by 11.

e) A number is divisible by 7 if the difference of the sums of the summation of the numbers formed
by alternate three digits from the right is divisible by 7. As for example 1668266767874 divisible
by 7 because (874 767 + 266 668 + 001) = 294 = 42  7.

In this problem you will have to automatically discover the conditions of divisibility testing for
different number systems (2 < Base < 500) and different numbers (less than 5000) as divisors. If
condition is not found adding all the digits, considering up to 1000 rightmost digits as a number or
considering the summation of up to 1000 alternate digits just print the line condition not found..
If the condition is found then output should be formatted according to the following sample output.
When more than one type of condition is found print them according to the order specified above (first
try considering the left most digits, then adding all digits, then and then the alternate digit scheme)
print that condition and processes the next input. The sample outputs will make everything clear.
```

## Input

```
First line of the input file contains an integer number N (N  2000), which indicates how many sets
of input are there. Each of the next N lines makes one set of input. Each line contains two integer
numbers B (2 < B < 500) and D (2  D < 5000). Here B is the base of the number system you have
to consider and D is the number for which you have to find the divisibility criteria. Note that you
wont have to consider any compound condition. As for example, in decimal number system testing
divisibility test for 2 and 3 can test the divisibility by 6. But you should not consider this, as it is a
mixture of two rules. You should only consider the individual rules explained at the top.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. Output format for all divisibility schemes is shown in
the sample output. The sample output contains all the different types of rules. A blank line should be
printed between the outputs of two consecutive sets.
