title: Uva 11766  Racing Car Computer
---


```
The racing cars of today are equipped with so many sophisticated equipment. Introduction of a new
visual transducer which is interfaced with the on-board computer can tell you on the fly how many
cars are ahead of you while how many are trailing. There are N cars on a racing track. Each has an
on-board computer with the new feature. During the race, every single cars computer keeps displaying
two integers, a (The number of cars in front of him) & b (The number of cars behind him) for a
particular moment. It is possible that at some time, some of the cars are racing side by side i.e. they
are exactly at the same location. A car will not consider any other car at the same location to be a
leading or trailing car.

Now, it is suspected that some of the new transducers are not working properly inside such high
speed vehicles. The report with all computers data generated at a particular timestamp is reported to
you. You are to determine the minimum number of cars that have faulty data.
```

## Input

```
Each test case begins with an integer N (1  N  1000), the number of cars on a track. The next N
lines each has two integers  a & b (0  a, b  1500) for a particular car.

The last test case is followed by a line with a single 0 indicating the end of input.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line in the format, Case X: Y , where X is the case number & Y is the
minimum number of cars that must have faulty data according to the report.
