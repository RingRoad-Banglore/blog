title: Uva 12069  Robots inside the Labyrinth
---


```
Dr. Jemison is simulating the navigation system of a robot. He is using a 2D labyrinth containing
several rectangular blocks. All blocks are placed either vertically or horizontally. Spaces are available
around the blocks. A robot can use these empty places for its movement. While moving, the robot is
not allowed to touch or pass through any block. Also, robots movement must be either horizontal or
vertical. A sample scenario is given in the following picture, where rounded blocks indicate the position
of robot.

The main aspect of Jemisons experiment is to test whether a robot can turn timely in the right
direction and reach its destination. Jemison has already embedded the complete map of the labyrinth
and its final position inside the robots memory. As turning is costly, Jemison wants the robot to reach
its destination using minimum number of turns. For example, in the above figure, it requires at least
two turns to reach the destination.

In this problem you will be given a labyrinth of infinite extent. There can be zero or more rectangular
blocks inside the labyrinth. Each rectangular block will be defined by its bottom-left (lx, by) and top-
right (rx, ty) corners. Rectangular blocks will not overlap one another but they can share a common
border line. The starting and ending positions of the robot will be denoted by Cartesian coordinates.
These positions will not touch any block or stay inside it. You have to find the minimum number of
turns that the robot must make to reach its destinations from starting positions.
```

## Input

```
In the first line, there will be an integer, T (1  T  50) denoting the number of tests. Each input
will start with an integer, N (0  N  50), where N is the number of rectangular blocks. Following
N lines will contain the description of a rectangular block. Each line will contain 4 integers lx, by, rx
(greater than lx), ty (greater than by). Next line will contain another integer K (1  K  20) which is
the number of queries. Each query will contain starting and ending coordinates of the robot in a line
(two positions will be distinct always). The coordinates will be positive integer and will not exceed 108.

Two successive input cases will be separated by a blank line.

## Output

```
For each input set, output must start with a line Labyrinth #D, where D is the test number starting
from 1. It will be followed by minimum number of turns for each query in a separate line. If the robot
somehow cannot reach to its destination, print Impossible.. See sample input output for clarification.
