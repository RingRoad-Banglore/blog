title: Uva 12007  Chess board Coloring
---


## Input

```
You have a chessboard with N rows and N columns. You want to color each of the cells with exactly
N colors (colors are numbered from 0 to N  1). A coloring is valid if and only if no row or no columns
contains a duplicate color. That means in the final coloring each cell should be colored by a color from
0 to N  1. No row will contain two cells of the same color and same for the no column.

Your friend already colored some of the cells in the top-left corner (cells that are in the first R row
and in the first C columns). Your job is to color the rest of the cells or tell it is impossible to color.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T (1  T  50), the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line
containing 3 integers N (1  N  50), R (0  R  N) and C (0  C  N). Each of the next R line
contains C integers in each line. The j-th integer in the i-th line indicates the color of the cell located
at row i and column j. The initial coloring will be always valid. That means No row or column will
have duplicate integers. The initial colors are between 0 to N  1 inclusive.

```

## Sample Input

```
First line of each test case will be YES when it is possible to color the rest of the cells or NO otherwise.
In case it is possible to reach a valid coloring the next N line should contain N integers in each line
denoting the colors of the cells(in one of the valid final colorings). Each of these N integers should be
separated by a single space. There can be multiple valid colorings; you can output any valid coloring.
When the solution is NO, you do not have to output additional line.

```

4 2 2

2 0
4 2 3
0 1 2
