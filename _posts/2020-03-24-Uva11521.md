title: Uva 11521  Compressor
---


```

Your task is to compress a string of no more than 200 characters, using the following scheme:

 adjacent repeats: [S]k
which means: S repeated k times (where k is a one-byte integer. recall that the length of the
string does not exceed 200)

 repeats with gaps: [S]k{S1}t1{S2}t2 . . . {Sr}tr, where 1  ti < k, ti < ti+1
which means: write S for k times, then insert string Si after the ti-th occurrence of S.

Note that the compressing is done recursively, so S, S1, . . . , Sr mentioned above can all be com-
pressed further.

e.g. for the original string

I am WhatWhat is WhatWhat

the optimal compressed string is:

I am [What]4{ is }2
```

## Input

```
There are at most 20 test cases, each test case is a string containing no more than 200 printable charac-
ters, without whitespace characters (i.e., no spaces, no tabs), brackets (i.e. not in {(,),[,],{,}})
and digits.

Letters are case-sensitive.

```

## Output

```
For each case, print the length of the minimal string, and a compressed string. Note that every one-byte
integer should be counted as one character, even if it has two or three digits in its decimal form.

```

## Sample Input

```
I_am_WhatWhat_is_WhatWhat

aaaabaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaabaaaa

??????????

```

## Sample Output

```

19 I_am_[What]4{_is_}2

11 [[a]8{b}4]3

4 [?]10
```
