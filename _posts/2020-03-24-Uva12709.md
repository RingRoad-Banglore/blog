```

Ants make up 10% of the total world animal tissue. The
total biomass of all the ants on Earth is roughly equal to the
total biomass of all the people on Earth. However, unlike
the people on Earth when they fall from a height they do
not die for two reasons:

 They have so little mass relative to their air resistance
that they fall slowly and, therefore, have little energy
to dissipate when they hit the ground.

 Their bodies are tiny deformable tanks, well designed
to absorb blows.

In general, small objects have less impact of gravitation
on them because they have more surface area/volume compared to larger objects. For example consider
a (1x1x1) cube. Its surface area is 6 and volume is 1. So the ratio is 6:1 and for a (10x10x10) cube the
surface area is 600 and volume is 1000. So the ratio is 6:10. Given the shape of many ants you will
have to find out which ant has the highest effect of gravitation on it.

For simplicity we will assume the following things in this
problem:

1. All ants are described as a box shaped object. A box
shaped object is described with three integers L, W ,
and H which denotes the length, width and height of
the object. So the volume of the ant is (LW H).

2. The density (Mass per unit volume) is 1. So the mass
of the above mentioned ant is also (LWH) and so
the weight is (LWH)g (Here g is the acceleration
caused by gravitation).

3. When an ant freely falls four sides are upright and
so the faces at the top and bottom are parallel with
the horizon. So the area of the plane facing bottom
is always L  W . For any ant the upward force put
by the air is proportional to the area of the of the
bottom face. To be specific it is LWg

2
. After some

manipulation it can be proved that the downward ac-
celeration f = g  g

2H
. So the downward acceleration actually depends solely on the value of H

(as g is same for all ants).

Given the dimension of several ants, report the volume of the ant that has the highest downward
acceleration. If there is a tie, report the one with the largest volume.

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 500 test cases. The description of each test case is given below:
First line of each test case contains an integer T (T  100) which denotes the total number of ants

to consider. Each of the next T lines contains three integers which denote the value of L, W and H
(1  L,W,H  50) of an ant respectively.

Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the volume of the ant that has the
highest downward acceleration. If there is a tie report the ant with the highest volume.
