title: Uva 10923  Seven Seas
---


## Input

```
Seven Seas is a nice game where you are the captain of a battle ship. You are in the middle of the
ocean and there are some enemy ships trying to catch you. Your mission is to run away from them.
Destroy the enemies if you can!

The game is played on a 9 8 board and you can move in all the 8 directions, one step each time.
You move first, then the enemy ships move. The enemy ships are pretty dumb, so that they will always
move to the closest position they can get to you, even if that position will destroy their ship. A ship is
destroyed if it moves to a cell that contais a rock. If two enemy ships move to the same cell they are
also destroyed and their remains will stay in that cell so that if another ship try to move there it will
be destroyed too.

If an enemy ship reaches your ship, you are dead and the game is over.
```
