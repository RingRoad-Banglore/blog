title: Uva 11109  Rinse
---


## Input

```text
Grannys reunion was a smashing success.
Next she is expecting a visit from Eliot
Ness and in anticipation of his visit would
like to remove as much whiskey from the
cream can as possible prior to his visit.

Granny can upend the cream can,
thus pouring its contents on the ground.
But due to surface tension and the shape
of the can a small amount of the content
remains, even after the can is upended.
Granny has a barrel full of rain water that
she can use to rinse the can several times.
Each rinse involves pouring some amount
of water (perhaps none) into the cream
can, mixing it thoroughly with the exist-
ing contents, and pouring it out. After each rinse an amount of liquid remains, some fraction of which
is whiskey and the rest water.

Mr. Ness visit is imminent, affording Granny the time to do at most k rinses. You are to determine
a rinsing strategy that Granny should employ to minimize the amount of residual whiskey in the cream
can after the last rinse.

## Output

```text
Standard input consists of several test cases. Each test case is represented by a line with five numbers:

 0 < k  100  an integer denoting the maximum number of rinses

 Vb > 0  a real number denoting the volume of available rain water in the barrel

 Vw > 0  a real number denoting the volume of whiskey in the cream can

 Vr > 0  a real number denoting the volume of liquid that cannot be poured out by upending
the can (further liquid might be eliminated by evaporation, but there is insufficient time before
Ness visit for any evaporation to take place)

 Vc > Vw, Vr  a real number denoting the maximum capacity of the cream can.

A line containing 0 follows the last case.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output r, the number of rinses that Granny should perform. On the same line,
output r real numbers, rounded to two decimal places, giving the amount of rain water to be used for
each rinse, in order.

Note that the total amount of water used in all rinses must not exceed Vb. The total amount of
liquid in the cream can cannot exceed Vc at any time. Assume that whiskey and water mix perfectly
and that their volumes are additive; that is, x units of whiskey and y units of water combine to form
x+ y units of liquid.
