title: Uva 10233  Dermuba Triangle
---


## Input

```
Dermuba Triangle is the universe-famous flat and triangular
region in the L-PAX planet in the Geometria galaxy. Actu-
ally nobody knows whether the region is triangular or how
it came into existence or how big it is. But the people of
Dermuba firmly believe that the region extends to infinity.
They live in equilateral triangular fields with sides exactly
equal to 1km. Houses are always built at the circumcen-
tres of the triangular fields. Their houses are numbered as
shown in the figure on the right.

When Dermubian people wishes to visit each other, they
follow the shortest path from their house to the destination
house. This shortest path is obviously the straight line
distance that connects these two houses. Moreover, they
also visit all the houses that lie in the straight line they
travel. Now, comes your task. You have to write a program which computes the length of the shortest
path between two houses given their house numbers.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of several lines with two non-negative integer values n and m which specify the start and
destination house numbers. 0  n, m  2147483647. Actually, there are houses beyond this region,
but some seventh-sense people in Dermuba say that these houses are left for the dead people.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line in the input, print the shortest distance between the given houses in kilometers rounded
off to three decimal places.

```

## Sample Output

```
0 7
2 8
9 10
10 11
