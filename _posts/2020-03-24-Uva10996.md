title: Uva 10996  Go
---


```
Go is played on a square board with an odd
number of vertical and horizontal lines. The
usual board sizes are 99, 1313 and 1919.
But well assume the size in n n for 3  n 
19.

Black and White alternately play stones on
the intersection between two lines. Black starts.
At any time one player may pass  not play a
stone  but if both players pass the game ends.
Well denote playing a stone by P (x, y) where
P is either B (for Black) or W (for White) and
(1  n)/2  x, y  (n  1)/2 gives the grid
position of the stone to be played. The centre
intersection of the board has coordinates (0,0).

The rules of Go are reasonably straightfor-
ward, but the nuances of strategy make it an
extremely challenging game. You are to use
the following rules.

 Black plays first.

 Black and White alternate; at each turn a player may place a stone or may pass. The game ends
when Black and White pass consecutively.

 A stone may be played only on an unoccupied intersection.

 If one player P places a stone so that his or her stones (along with the edge of the board) completely
surround a connected area occupied by stones belonging to the other player, Q, Qs stones are said
to be captured and removed from the board. More precisely, two intersections are connected if
they are horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) adjacent. Stones in an area are completely
surrounded if no stone is connected with a vacant intersection.

 If P places a stone that causes Qs stones to be captured, Ps stone is not captured.

 A connected area surrounded by Ps stones which contains none of Qs stones is said to be owned
by P.

 The score for player P is the number of vacant intersections owned by P in the final board
configuration plus the number of Qs stones captured by P at any time during the game.

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing n  the size of the
board  and m  the number of stones placed in the game. m lines follow, each giving a placement in
the format above. Note that m counts only stone placements  passes may result in two consecutive
placements by the same player. You may assume that each move is legal. A line containing 0 0 follows
the last test case.
