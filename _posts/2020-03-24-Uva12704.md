## Input

```

Bangladesh whitewashed New Zealand in the three-match one day in-
ternational series defeating the visitors by four wickets in the last and
final match in Narayanganj. The Tigers scored 309 runs in 49.2 overs
for the loss of six wickets at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in
Fatullah .The most remarkable was the performance from the batsman
of tiger side. Mominul, Nasir, Naeem, Mushfiq all showed tremendous
batting performance. People call them little masters. They are clever
enough to find a quick boundary. Here we have to do a little task for
our busy little masters. We have to find out the length of the shortest
and longest boundary distance from the batsman. We know the radius
of the circular stadium and the position of the batsman.

Center of the stadium is always the origin (0, 0).

Boundary means the perimeter of the circular field.

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases. Each case starts with a line
containing three integers x, y, r (0  x, y, r  1000). (x, y) denotes the coordinate of the batsman.
And r denotes the radius of the stadium. You can safely assume that coordinate of the batsman will
not be out of the stadium.

## Sample Input

```

point, properly rounded. See the samples for exact formatting.
