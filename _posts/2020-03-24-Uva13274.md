title: Uva 13274  Christmas  Tree
---


## Input

```text
Christmas is coming and Bob wants to decorate his tree. The tree has  N nodes.  1 is the root. He
thinks a tree is beautiful if each node has exactly K child (immediate descendant) nodes (of course
except the leaf nodes). He wants to remove zero or more nodes of the tree so that the property holds. If
we delete a non-leaf node, the whole subtree rooted in that node, will be removed from the tree. What
is the maximum number of nodes the tree can have after deleting some (possibly zero) nodes  so  that  it 
 has   the  above  properties?
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains  T (1  T  1000) , number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains
two space-separated integers  N ( 1  N  1000)  and  K (1  K  100) . Each of the next  N  1 lines 
 contains  two  integers  U   and  V  (1  U, V  N),  denoting  an  edge.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For  each  case,  print  the  case  number  and  the  answer.
