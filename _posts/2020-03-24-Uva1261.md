title: Uva 01261  String Popping
---


```
We are given a string s of two characters a and b. Let a group be a maximal consecutive substring
of the same character. Any group g of s of length at least two can be removed (or popped) and a new
string is constructed by concatenating the remaining left and right substrings of s. We repeat this
process until either the string becomes the empty string or there is no more group of length at least
two.

For example, string s = babbbaaabb has 5 groups b, a, bbb, aaa, and bb. The string s can be turned
into the empty string by popping groups in the following sequence (the underlined group is to be popped
in the sequence):

babbbaaabb  baaaabb  bbb  empty string

But the group may not turn to an empty string by a different sequence of pop operations:

babbbaaabb  babbbaaa  baaaa  b

Given a string, write a program to decide whether the string can be turned into the empty string
by some sequence of popping operations.
```

## Input

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case consists of a single line containing a string
of two characters a and b. The minimum and maximum length of the string is 1 and 25, respectively.

```

## Output

```
Your program is to write to standard output. Print one line for each test case. The line of each test
case should contain 0 or 1. Print 1 if the input string can be turned to an empty string by a sequence
of popping operations. Otherwise print 0.

The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
babbbaaabb
aabbaabb
abab

```

## Sample Output

```
1
1
0
```
