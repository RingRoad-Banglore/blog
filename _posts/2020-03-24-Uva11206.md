title: Uva 11206  Coloring the Map but Not Anyhow
---


## Input

```
We want to solve the classical problem of coloring map regions in
such a way that no regions that share a common boundary have
been colored with the same color, assuming that a boundary is a
frontier between two regions larger than a single point.

Let R = {r1, . . . , rn} be the set of different regions which the
map consists of; b : R  R  Boolean, a function such that
b(ri, rj) = True if ri and rj share a common boundary, and C =
{c1, . . . , ck} the set of available different colors. A solution for
this problem is a mapping S : R  C such that:

b(ri, rj) = True  S(ri) = S(rj), for allri, rjinR

There exist results that prove that only four different colors
(k = 4) are sufficient to color any flat map considering the above
conditions.

The main difference between this classical problem and ours
is that we shall not accept any solution, but the best one. We
shall assume that the different colors c1, . . . , ck are natural numbers whose value is proportional to
their dominant position in the spectrum of visible light. For any two different colors ci and cj , the
larger |ci  cj | is, the more different these colors look to the eye. We want to obtain the solution that
maximizes: 

(S(ri) S(rj))2,

for all ri, rj in R such that b(ri, rj) = True, and i < j.
```

## Output

```
The input will consist of a set of cases to be solved. Each case consists of the following input data:

 A line with six natural numbers separated with a single blank space: NN , NB, C1, C2, C3, and
C4, where:

 NN is the number of map regions (you may assume that for any case NN will be 20 at
most),

 NB is the number of boundaries among the NN regions, and
 C1, . . . , C4 are the values of the four available colors.

 NB lines with two natural numbers between 1 and NN each that identify the regions that share
one boundary.

You may assume that the input data correspond to a feasible flat map, and that no region will be
adjacent to (share a boundary with) itself.

A case starting with a line containing a single zero marks the end of the input data. This case
should not be processed nor output issued for it.

## Sample Input

```
For each input case to be solved, the program must issue an output line with a single number with the
value of the best solution, i.e. the maximum value found for:

(S(ri) S(rj))2,

for all ri, rj in R such that b(ri, rj) = True, and i < j.
There should appear no blank spaces in the output line after of before this value.
You may also assume that results will never exceed a 32 bits signed integer number.
