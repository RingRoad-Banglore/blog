title: Uva 00927  Integer Sequences from Addition of Terms
---


```
We consider sequences formed from the addition of terms of a given sequence. Let {an}, n = 1, 2, 3, . . .,
be an arbitrary sequence of integer numbers; d a positive integer. We construct another sequence {bm},
m = 1, 2, 3, . . ., by defining bm as consisting of n d occurrences of the term an:

b1 = a1, . . . , a1  
d occurrences of a1

, b2 = a2, . . . , a2  
2d occurrences of a2

, b3 = a3, . . . , a3  
3d occurrences of a3

,   

For example, if an = n, and d = 1,then the resulting sequence {bm} is:

1
b1

, 2, 2
b2

, 3, 3, 3  
b3

, 4, 4, 4, 4  
b4

,   

Given an and d we want to obtain the corresponding k-th integer in the sequence {bm}. For example,
with an = n and d = 1 we have 3 for k = 6; we have 4 for k = 7. With an = n and d = 2, we have 2
for k = 6; we have 3 for k = 7.

## Input

```
The first line of input contains C (0 < C < 100), the number of test cases that follows.
Each of the C test cases consists of three lines:

1. The first line represents an  a polynomial in n of degree i with non-negative integer coefficients
in increasing order of the power:

an = c0 + c1n+ c2n
2 + c3n

3 +   + cini

where cj  IN0, j = 0, . . . , i. This polynomial an is codified by its degree i followed by the
coefficients cj , j = 0, . . . , i. All the numbers are separated by a single space.

2. The second line is the positive integer d.

3. The third line is the positive integer k.

It is assumed that the polynomial an is a polynomial of degree less or equal than 20 (1  i  20) with
non-negative integer coefficients less or equal than 10000 (0  cj  10000, j = 0, . . . , i); 1  d  100000;
1  k  1000000.

```

## Output

```
The output is a sequence of lines, one for each test case. Each of these lines contains the k-th integer
in the sequence {bm} for the corresponding test case. This value is less or equal than 263  1.
