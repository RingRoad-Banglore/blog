title: Uva 12308  Smallest Enclosing Box
---


```
There are n points in 3D space. Youre to find a smallest enclosing box of these points. By smallest
we mean volume. Note that the sides of the box might not be parallel to the coordinate axes.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 10 test cases in the input. Each test case begins with a single integer n (4  n 
10), the number of points. Each of the following n lines contains three integers x, y, z (100  x, y, z 
100), the coordinates of the points. The points will not be coplanar. The last test case is followed by
a line with n = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line, print the volume of the smallest enclosing box, rounded to two decimal places.

Note: In the fourth example, the vertices of the minimal bounding box are:

(9.33269, 4.89595, 7.61936), (2.62752, 2.26606, 7.37561)
(9.70517, 4.62989, 0.243756), (3, 2, 0)
(6.70509, 11.6301, 7.24374), (0, 9, 7)
(7.07757, 11.3641, -0.131862), (0.372395, 8.73416, -0.375618)
