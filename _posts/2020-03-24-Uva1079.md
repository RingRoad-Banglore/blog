title: Uva 01079  A Careful Approach

```
If you think participating in a programming contest is stressful, imagine being an air traffic controller.
With human lives at stake, an air traffic controller has to focus on tasks while working under constantly
changing conditions as well as dealing with unforeseen events.

Consider the task of scheduling the airplanes that are landing at an airport. Incoming airplanes
report their positions, directions, and speeds, and then the controller has to devise a landing schedule
that brings all airplanes safely to the ground. Generally, the more time there is between successive
landings, the safer a landing schedule is. This extra time gives pilots the opportunity to react to
changing weather and other surprises.

Luckily, part of this scheduling task can be automated - this is where you come in. You will be given
scenarios of airplane landings. Each airplane has a time window during which it can safely land. You
must compute an order for landing all airplanes that respects these time windows. Furthermore, the
airplane landings should be stretched out as much as possible so that the minimum time gap between
successive landings is as large as possible. For example, if three airplanes land at 10:00am, 10:05am,
and 10:15am, then the smallest gap is five minutes, which occurs between the first two airplanes. Not
all gaps have to be the same, but the smallest gap should be as large as possible.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases consisting of descriptions of landing scenarios. Each test case
starts with a line containing a single integer n (2  n  8), which is the number of airplanes in the
scenario. This is followed by n lines, each containing two integers ai, bi, which give the beginning and
end of the closed interval [ai, bi] during which the i-th plane can land safely. The numbers ai and bi are
specified in minutes and satisfy 0  ai  bi  1440.

The input is terminated with a line containing the single integer zero.

```

## Output

```
For each test case in the input, print its case number (starting with 1) followed by the minimum
achievable time gap between successive landings. Print the time split into minutes and seconds, rounded
to the closest second. Follow the format of the sample output.
