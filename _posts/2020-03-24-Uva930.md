## Input

```text

Let
P (x) = anx

n + an1x
n1 + . . .+ a1x+ ao.

be a n-th degree polynomial with coefficients ao, . . . , an. If z is a root of P (x), that is, P (z) = 0, then
the first degree polynomial (xz) divides P (x), that is, P (x) = (xz)Q(x), where Q(x) is a polynomial
with a degree less than n. In the same way, if w is a root of Q(x), then Q(x) = (x  w)R(x), and,
obviously, P (x) = (x z)(xw)R(x), which means that w is a root of P (x), also. This means that the
more roots of P (x) we know, the easier it is to know the ones we dont know, because we are obtaining
polynomials of decreasing degrees. When, finally, we obtain a 2nd degree polynomial,ax2+ bx+ c , as a
result of the division, we have a very simple way of finding its two roots: we use the quadratic formula

to compute them.
How can we find Q(x), such that P (x) = (x  z)Q(x), having P (x) and one of its

roots, z? That is, how can we divide P (x) by (x  z)? We describe here the Ruffini
rule, a simple process for dividing polynomials by 1st degree polynomials of the form (x  z):

 On a first line we write the coefficients of P (x)
(see figure I).

 On a second line we write the root of the poly-
nomial (x z), which is z (see figure II).

 On the third line we start by writing the first
coefficient of P (x) which is 3 (see figure III).

 Then we write on the second line, right be-
low the second coefficient of P (x), the value
-6 which is the product of z (which is -2) by
the previous value on the third line (which is
3). Then we write on the third line, right below
that -6 product value, the sum of that -6 value
with the second coefficient of P (x) (which is 6),
which gives the value zero (see figure IV).

 We repeat the previous step for the remaining
coefficients of P (x) (see figure V).

At the end, we obtain on the third line the coeffi-
cients of the resulting polynomial  Q(x)  and the
remainder of the division (in this case is zero because
we are dividing P (x) by one of its roots). In figure V
we see the coefficients of Q(x). So, Q(x) = x3 +0x2 +21x+18 . The remainder of the division is zero,
as expected.

Your task consists of writing a program that, given the coefficients of a nth degree polynomial, and
n 2 roots of that polynomial, finds the other two roots. Assume that all roots are real.

## Output

```text
The input is one text file (standard input) that has, in the first line, the number k of polynomials that
are to be processed. The next 3  k lines contain the information about the k polynomials. The first
of each set of three lines contains the value n of the polynomial degree; the second of each set of three
lines contains n + 1 values separated by spaces (the coefficients of the polynomial), and the third of
each set of three lines contains n 2 values which represent n 2 roots of the polynomial. You know
that there can be some repeated roots; the third line of each set of three lines contains exactly n  2
root values, even if some of them are repeated.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output file must have 2  k lines, each pair containing each of the two unknown roots of the
polynomial. Each pair of roots must be in decreasing order. These values must be rounded to one
decimal place.
