## Input

```text

Bill is working in a secret laboratory. He is developing missiles for national security projects. Bill is
the head of the aerodynamics department.

One surprising fact of aerodynamics is called Whitcomb area rule. An object flying at high-subsonic
speeds develops local supersonic airflows and the resulting shock waves create the effect called wave
drag. Wave drag does not depend on the exact form of the object, but rather on its cross-sectional
profile.

Consider a coordinate system with OZ axis pointing in the direction of objects motion. Denote
the area of a section of the object by a plane z = z0 as S(z0). Cross-sectional profile of the object is
a function S that maps z0 to S(z0). There is a perfect aerodynamic shape called Sears-Haack body.
The closer cross-sectional profile of an object to the cross-sectional profile of Sears-Haack body, the less
wave drag it introduces. That is an essence of Whitcomb area rule.

Bills department makes a lot of computer simulations to study missiles aerodynamic properties
before it is even built. To approximate missiles cross-sectional profile one takes samples of S(z0) for
integer arguments z0 from zmin to zmax.

Your task is to find the area S(z0) for each integer z0 from zmin to zmax, inclusive, given the
description of the missile. The description of the missile is given to you as a set of points. The missile
is the minimal convex solid containing all the given points. It is guaranteed that there are four points
that do not belong to the same plane.

## Output

```text
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive test cases are
separated by a single blank line.

The first line of the input contains three integer numbers: n, zmin and zmax (4  n  100, 0 
zmin  zmax  100). The following n lines contain three integer numbers each: x, y, and z coordinates
of the given points. All coordinates do not exceed 100 by their absolute values. No two points coincide.
There are four points that do not belong to the same plane.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.

For each integer z0 from zmin to zmax, inclusive, output one floating point number: the area S(z0).
The area must be precise to at least 5 digits after decimal point.
