title: Uva 12254  Electricity Connection
---


## Input

```text
The city AjobakahD has a lot of problems with electricity. Load shedding is a common problem here
and people are quite used to it. Instead of calculating the total time the power is on, they calculate the
total time the power is off. And of course the later one is always greater.

There is a small area in the city, which has not yet been enlightened with any load shedding! That
means they havent got the electricity connection yet. Now the Power Development Board (PDB) wants
to set electricity connection in that area. Since the overall power in that city is not sufficient, they have
decided to build a power generator in that area and want to connect all the houses to the generator.

The area can be modeled as an 8  8 grid. Each cell contains one of the following characters

 . means land

 H means house

 G means power generator

 W means water

Two adjacent cells can be connected by ca-
bles and the cost is 1 thousand. Two cells are
said to be adjacent if they share a side. But two
adjacent cells can only be connected if none of
the cells is empty. Empty means either land or
water. In such case, pillars can be built in the

cells and after that they can be connected. The cost of placing a pillar in a land and water cell is pl and
pw thousand respectively. Remember that both the costs can be zero, because there can be sponsors
who might use the pillars to advertise themselves.

Now given the modeled grid of the area, the PDB wants to find the minimum cost to connect all
the houses to the power generator directly or indirectly. Thats why they seek your help, as you are
one of the finest programmers in town.
```

## Output

```text
Input starts with a positive integer T (T  200) denoting the number of cases.

Each case starts with two integers pl and pw (0  pl, pw  10). Then there will be 8 lines, each
containing 8 characters from the set {., H, G, W}. You may assume that in any modeled grid, there is
exactly one power generator and the total number of houses is between 1 and 8 (inclusive).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and the total cost in thousands. Look at the output for
sample input for formatting details.
