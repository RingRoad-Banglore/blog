title: Uva 11667  Income Tax Hazard II
---


```
The word tax makes us unhappy and if it is income tax it saddens
us even more (have you ever wondered why many rich people leave
their own country and stay in Switzerland). The strangest thing
is that in many countries and states one has to pay income tax
as well as sales tax.

Now you are in a strange new country, whose income tax
structure is almost unknown to you. The things that you know
about the salary/tax structure of this country are given below:

1. Salary is always an integer but income tax may or may not be integer. Your salary is denoted
with M .

2. There are two slabs for income tax denoted by two integers S1 and S2. You have to pay 10%
income tax for salary part above S1 and below (S2).

3. You dont have to pay any income tax for the salary below S1.

4. For salary portion above S2 you will have to pay 20% income tax. So if S1 = 50000 and S2 =
100000 and your salary is 120000, then your total income tax will be 500000.10+200000.20 =
9000.

5. The problem is, you dont know the value of S1 and S2. Only thing you know is that the value of
S1 and S2 is within two given integer values min and max (inclusive) and S1  S2.

Now given the values of min, max and M you have two find the expected amount of income tax
that you need to pay. You should assume that all distinct combinations of S1 and S2 satisfying the
above conditions are equally likely.
