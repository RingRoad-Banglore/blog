## Input

```
The one who reads a lot and walks a lot,

sees a lot and knows a lot.
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra

As you should know, a directed acyclic graph is a directed graph with no directed cycles. We define
a spray graph as a directed acyclic graph with the following form:

A spray graph of size 1

A spray graph of size 2

A spray graph of size 3

A spray graph of size 4



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 12967  Spray Graphs 2/2

and so on.
You have to compute the number of different paths from the central node (the gray node, P) to any

leaf node (yellow ones) in a spray graph of size n.
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer, t, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case,
one line appears containing an integer n, 1  n  30, representing the size of the spray graph.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case the output should contain a single line, indicating the number of different paths from
the central node to any leaf node in the corresponding graph.

```

## Sample Output

```
4
1
2
3
4
