```
Every parent wants to have their child the most beautiful name. Everyone will call their beloved child
using the name. If someday the child gets to be famous then he/she will be known by the name. So
name is very important. But choosing name is not that easy for the people nowadays because the
government have decided to put tax on the name.

You will be given a perfect name PN consisting of every character from a-z only once (That is
permutation of lower case English alphabet). The tax of a name will be calculated with reference to
PN . Suppose PN = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwzyx. For a name NM , the tax is the summation of
taxes for its each character. Suppose the i-th character of NM is Ci. Let POS be the position of Ci
in PN . So the tax for Ci will be (i POS)  POS.

Suppose NM = abazz. So the taxes are:

i = 0, C0 = a, POS = 0, tax = (0 0)  0 = 0
i = 1, C1 = b, POS = 1, tax = (1 1)  1 = 0
i = 2, C2 = a, POS = 0, tax = (2 0)  0 = 0
i = 3, C3 = z, POS = 23, tax = (3 23)  23 = 460
i = 4, C4 = z, POS = 23, tax = (4 23)  23 = 437

So total tax for NM is 0 + 0 + 0  460  437 = 897. As this is negative, that means instead of
giving tax to government, government will pay 897 Tk to the name-holders parent.

Now the parents are applying a very clever trick. You can understand very easily that the longer
a name the greater its tax. So after fixing a particular name NM , they are splitting it into exactly K
parts (this value K is enforced by government). Each of this K parts are considered as a single name
and thus the total tax becomes much less. For example if we split the name in the earlier example in
two parts aba and zz the taxes becomes 0(0 + 0 + 0) and 1035(529 506) [Here, 0 is the cost
of aba and -1035 is the cost for zz. That is  calculate tax separately for each of the K parts.].
So the sum is -1035 which is less than -895.

Now, given PN , NM and K, you need to find the minimum tax.
```

## Input

```
First line will contain the number of test case, T (T  10). Each case will contain PN and K
(0 < K  500) in the first line. The next line will contain a not empty string NM . Length of NM will
be at most 20000 and greater than or equals to K and will consist of only lowercase letters.

```

## Output

```
For each case print one line, Case C: TX (without the quotes), where C is the case number and
TX is minimum tax.

Explanation: 3 parts for the last sample are aabbb, cccc and ccccc. The corresponding taxes
are 6 (0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3), -4 (-4 -2 + 0 + 2) and 0 (-4 -2 + 0 + 2 + 4).

So total tax is 6 - 4 + 0 = 2.
