title: Uva 13032  Marbles in Jars
---


## Input

```text
There are N jars. Each of the jars are labeled from 1 to N . Each jar contains marbles. The quantity
of marbles in the jars is M1, M2, M3, , Mn, where M1 is the number of marbles in the first jar and
so on. All the jars contain marbles that weighs 1 gram, except one jar that contains marbles weighing
1.1 grams. Lets call this jar The Fat Jar.

You have a weighing machine, but you are allowed to use it exactly once. You need to find out
the fat jar.

One neat way to find the fat jar is, (assuming we have enough marbles in each jar) take 1 marble
from the 1st jar, 2 from 2nd jar, 3 from 3rd jar and so on. Lets say we have 4 jars in total. So ideally,
the marbles should weigh 10grams collectively. Suppose, it weighs 10.3 grams. What does that tell us?
The third jar has to be the fat jar. Because the extra 0.3 grams must have came from the three marbles
that we took from the third jar.

Interestingly, there are several other ways to find out the fat jar. We call each way a Strategy.
Formally, a strategy is an array of N positive numbers: X1, X2, X3, , Xn, such that we take X1 marbles
from the first jar, X2 marbles from the second jar and so on. We weigh X1+X2+X3+ . . .+Xn marbles
in the weighing machine and try to find out the fat jar. A strategy is called Winning when it is
always possible to find the fat jar following that strategy.

Given N jars with the number of marbles in each jar, how many different winning strategies are
there? Two strategies are different if there exists an index i, for which Xi is different between those
strategies.
```

## Output

```text
First line contains the T (0 < T  100), the number of test cases. Each case starts with N (1  N 
100). Next line contains N integers M1, M2, M3, , Mn. (For all i, 1  i  N , 0  Mi  100).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, print one line, Case C: A (without the quotes). Here C is the case number and A is
the answer that case. As the answer can be pretty huge, print the answer modulo 1,000,000,007.

Explanation: The winning strategies in case 3 are {1, 2} and {2, 1}.
