title: Uva 01549  Lattice Point
---


```

A lattice point is a point (x, y) in the 2-dimensional xy-plane with x, y  ZZ, where ZZ be the set of
integers. Let

P (r) = {(x, y)|x2 + y2  r2, (x, y) is a lattice point in the xy-plane}

and we denote D(r) be the number of elements in P (r). For each lattice point (x, y) in the xy-plane,
let

S(x, y) = {(u, v)|x  u  x+ 1, y  v  y + 1}

and
B(r) = {(x, y)|x2 + y2  r2, x and y are real numbers}

Then it is easy to verify that when r >

B(r

(x,y)P (r)

S(x, y)  B(r +

2)

We know that

Area


 

(x,y)P (r)

S(x, y)


 = 

(x,y)P (r)

Area(S(x, y)) =


(x,y)P (r)

1 = D(r).

Hence
(r 


2)2 < D(r) < (r +


2)2

This implies

It yields

So if we can calculate D(r) for a large r, then we can estimate the value of .
The following C function can be used to calculate the value of D(r) withing a reasonable aumount

of time when r is a small integer, say e.g., 1  r  10, 000.

long D(long r)

{ long x,y,count=0;

for(x=-r;x<=r;x++)

for(y=-r;y<=r;y++)

if(x*x+y*y<=r*r)

count++;

return count;

}

Is is easy to obtained D(1) = 5, D(2) = 13, D(3) = 29, and D(10000) = 314159053 using this
program. Recall that  = 3.14159 . . .. Your task is to find D(r) for a large r within a reasonable
amount of time.
