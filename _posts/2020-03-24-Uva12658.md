```

Write a program that recognizes characters. Dont worry, because you only need to recognize three
digits: 1, 2 and 3. Here they are:

.*. *** ***

.*. ..* ..*

.*. *** ***

.*. *.. ..*

.*. *** ***
```

## Input

```
The input contains only one test case, consisting of 6 lines. The first line contains n, the number of
characters to recognize (1  n  10). Each of the next 5 lines contains 4n characters. Each character
contains exactly 5 rows and 3 columns of characters followed by an empty column (filled with .).

```

## Output

```
The output should contain exactly one line, the recognized digits in one line.

```

## Sample Input

.*....*...*.

.*..***.***.

.*..*.....*.

.*..***.***.

```
