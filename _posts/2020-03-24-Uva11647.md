## Input

```
Nowadays, Talent Shows have become really popular.
There are a number of TV and News media in your
country, and each and every one of them has its own
Who is the Biggest Talent show. These shows re-
quire a set of judges, who evaluate the performance of
all the participants. All the participants are called to
participate in a particular order to perform in front
of the judges. Then the judges simultaneously eval-
uates them. Although, they are asked to grade them
by a score between 0 and 100, some of the judges
feel that, there are participants, who deserves more,
so, they can actually give them any score they think
right. The final score of a participant is the sum of
all the scores given by the judges.

Any people, not involved with any of these activ-
ities, may think that this is a really easy job both for
the judges and the participants. Because, all the par-
ticipants has to do is to do something they really like.
On the other hand, judges have the easier job, they
just have to relax and enjoy the performance pulled
by the competitors. Since, everyone do this thing in
their leisure time, they think that being a judge is
possibly the best possible work anyone can find.

But actually, it is as exhausting as any other work. The first few hours may be enjoyable, but soon
it becomes tedious and boring. Now, as there are so many talent shows, and every one of them use
the same persons as their judge, Since, one has to judge at different shows, not all of them can watch
all the performances. They decided to appear each of the show for only one session. It means, that, a
judge may appear in one show, at some specified time, and stay a certain period there, and leave. After
he leaves, he will never return to the show.

Goju is working in one of the Talent shows and he is very optimistic about his show. At the end of
the day, one of the crews, who was inside with the judges, informed him that, all the judges were really
tired, so, they just gave the same score to all the participants. Your inside man dont know how much
each participants scored. But he was able to guess that, and he assures you that, the participant didnt
score less than what he guessed. He has also given you a crucial information, how much generous the
judges are. He has also given a generosity score to each of the judges, which is an integer between 1 and
1000000. The lower the generosity score, the higher he is supposed to grade. But you should remember
that, the generosity score is just an assumption. It is possible that, a judge with lower generosity score,
may grade lower than someone, whose generosity score is higher.

Now, Goju wants to know how much point each judge given to the participants. But, since he is
very busy, he dont have time to solve this on his own. He asked you to solve it.

## Output

```
First line of the input contains T ( 200), the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two
integers J C (1  J,C  100), the number of judges and the number of competitors. Next line contains
C integers si (i = 1, 2, . . . , C) where si (1  si  1000000) is the score of the i-th participant, the crew

guessed. All the participants are numbered from 1 to C. This is followed by J lines, where j-th of this
contain three integers, pj , qj and gj , (1  gj  1000000, 1  pj  qj  C) which means that, j-th judge
only grades participants numbered between pj and qj (inclusive), and his generosity is gj .

There is a blank line before each test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the case number, followed by J integers mj , how much points, each judge has
given. All the scores are nonnegative integers and must fit inside a 32 bit signed integer. Since, there
can be many solutions, he wants you to minimize


mj  gj . If there are still more than one solution

answer any one of them. You can assume that there will always be at least one solution.
