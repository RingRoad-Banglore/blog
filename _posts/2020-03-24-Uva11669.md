title: Uva 11669  NonDecreasing Prime Sequence
---


## Input

```
A prime number is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors. First few
prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... and so on.

A non decreasing prime sequence (NDPS) is a sequence of prime numbers where i-th element is not
less than (i  1)-th element for all i > 1. The weight of a NDPS is the product of all numbers of the
sequence. Here are some examples of NDPSs with their corresponding weights.

NDPS Weight
2 2

2 5 13 130 (2  5  13)
2 3 97 582 (2  3  97)

An NDPS a is smaller than another NDPS b, if number of elements in a is smaller than the number
of elements in b. If a and b has same number of elements then lexicographically smaller sequence is the
smaller NDPS. For the list given above, {2} is the smallest sequence because it has only one elements.
{2 5 13} and {2 3 97} both have 3 elements, so {2 3 97} is second smallest because it is lexicographically
smaller than {2 5 13}.

For a given range (A,B), where A  B, you have to find the K-th smallest NDPS between all the
NDPSs having weights in between A and B (inclusive).
```

## Output

```
Input will start with an integer T (T  5000), the number of test cases. Each of the next T line will
contain three integers A, B and K (2  A  B  1000000). K is a positive integer and you can safely
assume that at least K NDPSs exists in the given range.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, you have to output one line, case number followed by the K-th smallest NDPS between
all the NDPSs having weights between A and B (inclusive). See sample output for exact format.

## Sample Output

```
3
2 10 1
2 10 5
2 10 9
