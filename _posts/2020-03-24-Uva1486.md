title: Uva 01486  Transportation
---


## Input

```text
There are N cities, and M directed roads connecting them. Now you want to transport K units of
goods from city 1 to city N . There are many robbers on the road, so you must be very careful. The
more goods you carry, the more dangerous it is. To be more specific, for each road i, there is a coefficient
ai. If you want to carry x units of goods along this road, you should pay ai  x2 dollars to hire guards
to protect your goods. And whats worse, for each road i, there is an upper bound Ci, which means
that you cannot transport more than Ci units of goods along this road. Please note you can only carry
integral unit of goods along each road.

You should find out the minimum cost to transport all the goods safely.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases.

The first line of each case contains three integers, N , M and K. (1  N  100, 1  M  5000,
0  K  100). Then M lines followed, each contains four integers (ui, vi, ai, Ci), indicating there is
a directed road from city ui to vi, whose coefficient is ai and upper bound is Ci. (1  ui, vi  N ,
0 < ai  100, Ci  5)

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output one line for each test case, indicating the minimum cost. If it is impossible to transport all the
K units of goods, output -1.
