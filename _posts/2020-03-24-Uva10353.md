title: Uva 10353  Circles in Hexagon 
---


```
It is often very difficult to find exact answers for some geometric problems with a straight forward
formula. Often it is better to use iterative processes to solve these difficult problems. In this problem
you are asked to find the minimum possible length of a side of a regular hexagon which can hold five and
eight circles of equal radius. But you don?t have to discover the way. The following image shows how
you can place five circles and eight of equal radius optimally in a regular hexagon. The arrangement of
the circles in both the pictures is symmetric along AB.

```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains a single integer N (0 < N  10000) which denotes the number
of inputs. Each of the next N lines contains a floating point number r which denotes the radius of five
circles.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input you should produce one line of output. This output should contain two floating
point numbers. They indicate the minimum possible length of a side of the regular hexagon in which
five circles and eight circles of radius r can be kept without overlapping. All the output numbers should
have 12 digits after the decimal point. You dont need to worry about small precision errors (less than
max (0.0000001%, 1e-9))

## Sample Output

```

0.000000000600 0.000000000742
