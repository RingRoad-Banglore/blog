title: Uva 10823  Of Circles and Squares
---


## Input

```
We have placed a number of circles and squares
on an infinite stretch of a 2D plane. These
circles and squares come in various sizes and
colors. But when we place more than one ob-
ject together, the color in the common region
of those objects becomes a mixture of the origi-
nal color. We define the color of each geometric
object by the 8 bit value of the Red, Green and
Blue components. For example, a circle drawn
in pure red would have the color (255,0,0). The
borderline of each geometric object is drawn in
black (0,0,0), and the empty spaces are always
white (255,255,255). Given a number of such
geometric objects and some points in the 2D
plane, your task is to determine the color of
the points. The color of a point is computed as the average red, average green and average blue values
of the geometric objects that this point falls into. If the point is on the borderline of any of the geo-
metric object, then its color would be black; if it falls in the empty space, the color of the point would
be white.

## Output

```
The first line of input gives you the number of test cases T (T  100) to follow. Each test case starts
with two integers, R and P . R (R  100) is the number of geometric objects and P (P  100) is the
number of query points. Then there will be R lines describing the objects. The description of each
geometric object follows the

object_type px py length r g b

format. object_type is the type of the geometric object, which can be CIRCLE or SQUARE. px and py
(1000  px, py  +1000) are two integers giving you the x and y coordinate of the center of the circle
or the lower left corner of the square depending on the object type. length (0  length  2000) is the
radius of the circle or the length of a side if it is a square. The r, g and b (0  r, g, b  255) values are
integers giving you the color of the object. The description of the query points starts after the description
of the objects. Each query point is denoted by an integer pair px and py (1000  px, py  1000) giving
you the x and y coordinate of that point.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the serial number of the test case first. Then for each of the query points,
print the color of that point in one line. All the colors are to be rounded to the nearest integer (for
example: 128.3 will be rounded to 128, 128.5 will be rounded to 129 and 128.7 will also be rounded to
129). There must be a blank line separating two test cases. Please consult the sample input/output
section for the exact format.
