```
All of you know about Gray Code. It is a number code where consecutive numbers are represented by
binary patterns that differ in one bit position only. In the following 4 examples of 3-bit gray code are
shown:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

In this problem we will deal with a gray code generation logic. This logic will generate the n-bit
gray code using the coding of (n 1) bits. Lets formally define the rules :

 Each gray code has a starting bit pattern. Such as 0 0 0 or 1 0 1, etc.

 An n-bit gray code will have 2n rows and two consecutive rows will differ by only one bit.

 Each bit pattren will be present exactly once.

 Gray code for 1-bit is trivial. Start with a bit and invert it in the next row.

 To construct n-bit gray code keep any of the n bits fixed (either 0 or 1) for the first 2(n1) rows
and use (n 1)-bit gray code (generated using this logic) for remaining (n 1) bits. Then invert
the fixed bit for the next 2(n1) rows and also use (n 1)-bit gray code for remaining (n 1) bits
whose bit pattern of the first row is the same as the bit pattern of the last row of previous 2(n1)
rows. For example 2-bit gray code starting with 00 may be:

00 00
01 10
11 Or 11
10 01

Simmilarly 2-bit gray code starting with 01 may be:

01 01
00 11
10 Or 10
11 00

If you observe carefully, you will see that the 3-bit gray codes given above are also constructed using
this logic. Many such gray codes are possible for a particular starting bit pattern. We can order them
from 1 to G(n) where G(n) denotes the number of such gray codes for n-bit. In our ordering scheme:



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10455  Gray Code 2/3

 1st n-bit gray code has its leftmost bit fixed and it uses 1st (n  1)-bit gray code for upper half
and also 1st (n 1)-bit gray code for lower half.

 G(n  1)-th n-bit gray code has its leftmost bit fixed and it uses 1st (n  1)-bit gray code for
upper half and G(n 1)-th (n 1)-bit gray code for lower half.

 [G(n 1) + 1]-th n-bit gray code has its leftmost bit fixed and it uses 2nd (n 1)-bit gray code
for upper half and 1st (n 1)-bit gray code for lower half.

 G(n)-th n-bit gray code has its rightmost bit fixed and it uses G(n 1)-th (n 1)-bit gray code
for both halves.

You have to find a n-bit gray code for given starting bit pattern and index.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains a single integer N (0 < N  1000) which denotes the number
of inputs. Each of the next N lines contains a string of bits for starting bit pattern and an integer for
index. Number of bits will be between 1 to 6. And the index will be valid.

```

## Output

```
Print the gray code for the given starting bit pattern and index. Put a blank line between two consec-
utive sets of inputs.
