title: Uva 10477  The Hybrid Knight
---


## Input

```
Hybridization is a very important concept in Biology, Chemistry and in many other fields. But is not
at all an important concept in chess. Today we shall introduce a new chess knight, which can move like
a normal knight, a mutant knight and like a mutant pawn in a chessboard.

The following figure illustrates the different types of moves of our hybrid knight. Please note that
the knight is never allowed to land outside the board.

Unfortunately, the knight cannot move according to his
own will. It maintains the following cyclic order when it
chooses its movement. It means if the knights first move-
ment is like a knight, the second movement will be like a
mutant knight, the third movement will be like a mutant
pawn, the fourth movement will be again like a knight and
so on. The same cycle applies if the hybrid knight starts
with the mutant knight move or with the mutant pawn
move. The cycle to be followed is shown in the given figure.

Given the size of the square shaped board, your job is to
find the minimum number of moves required by the hybrid
knight to reach from one board position to another. The
board positions are numbered in row major order from top
to bottom. So in a (88) chessboard the identifier of the
top-left corner is 1 and the identifier of the bottom right

corner is 64.

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 20 sets of input. Each set starts with two integers N(4  N  20)
and S(S  1000). N indicates that you have to work with a N N board and S is the total number

of queries in that set. Each of the next S lines contains 1 query. Each query contains two integers B
and E (1  B,E  N  N). Here B is the starting location of the knight and E is the destination
location of the knight. Input is terminated with a set whose value of N is zero. This case should not
be processed. You can assume that the hybrid knight takes 0 moves to go from X to X, where X is a
valid board position. However, there will be no such query where B and E is equal.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input you should output the serial of the set as shown in the output for sample input.
For each query in a set you should output the minimum number of moves required by the hybrid knight
to move from B to E. If the destination is unreachable from the source, print a ? without the quotes.

Note: The illustration given below shows the movement required for set 2. Here to go from 2 to 10
in a 1010 board the hybrid knight uses its mutant knight move first to go to cell number 15. Then
it uses the mutant pawn move to go one row down to cell number 25. The third move is like a regular
knight, it takes our knight to cell number 17. The fourth and final move is a mutant knight move that
takes our knight to the destination. Were showing the first 4 rows of the 1010 board here.
