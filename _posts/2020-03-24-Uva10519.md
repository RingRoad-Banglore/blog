University of Extraordinary Talents), the best university of Bangladesh. After passing, he has been
appointed manager of BCS (Bangladesh Calculation Society ). His first project is to visit a district and
then to report the total number of distinct regions there. But, going there, he is astonished to see a
very strange phenomena of the local people. He discovered that, the people make their area circular.
Every two area have exactly two points to intersect and no three circles intersect in a common point.
There are so many people so that its very hard to calculate total number of distinct regions for Raju.
So, only in this case he seeks for your help.
