title: Uva 13102  Tobby Stones
---


## Input

```
Tobby is an intelligent Boston Terrier who has a garden. In his garden he has N stones which, like
Tobby, are either black or white. The stones are organized in a row and numbered from 0 to N - 1.

Tobby likes to change his stones quite a lot and he does so by taking a contiguous part of his stones,
from integer indexes I to J, and making some changes to all stones located between those two indexes
(including the stones at I and J).

Given a list of changes that Tobby makes to his garden, your task is to answer queries about the
number of black and white stones in his garden.

Initially all stones in Tobbys garden are white.
```

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line in which there are two positive
integers N (1  N  106) and M (1  M  106) that represent, respectively, the number of stones in
Tobbys garden and the number of changes and queries to answer. Then M lines follow, each containing
either a change or a query. Each of those lines starts with an integer Q (0  Q  3):

 If Q is 0, then the line is a query, in that case two numbers follow: I (0  I < N) and J
(I  J < N), indicating the start and end positions to consider to answer the query.

 If Q is 1, then the line is a change of type reverse, in that case two integers follow: I (0  I < N)
and J (I  J < N), indicating that Tobby wants to reverse the color of all stones between those
indexes so that the color of stone I +K becomes the color of stone J K and the color of stone
J K becomes the color of stones I +K for all integer K such that 0  K and I +K < J K.

 If Q is 2, then the line is a change of type flip color, in that case two integers follow: I (0  I < N)
and J (I  J < N), indicating that Tobby wants to change the color of all stones between those
indexes so that all white stones become black stones and all black stones become white stones.

 If Q is 3, then the line is a change of type set color, in that case three integers follow: I (0  I < N),
J (I  J < N) and C (0  C  1) indicating that Tobby wants to set the color of all stones
between indexes I and J . If C is 0, then all stones between those two indexes should become
black, while if it is 1 they should become white.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each query in the input, you should print a single line with two integers: the number of black stones
and the number of white stones between the indexes I and J given in the query.
