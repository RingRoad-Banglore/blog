title: Uva 11042  Complex, difficult and complicated
---


## Input

```text
Complex numbers are not only complex, but also complicated. So you would better try to solve another
problem...

We have a complex number, a+ b  i, where i is the square root of -1. We want to make it simple
(I mean, real), by raising it to a natural power. For example, complex number 2 + 2  i, can be made
simple by raising it to 4:

(2 + 2  i)4 = 64

You have to compute the smallest natural number, N , (zero is not included) such that (a+ b  i)N
is a real number. Besides, we require that the absolute value of (a+ b  i)N is not bigger than 230.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer M , indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case, there is a line with two integers a and b. a is the real part of the complex number,
and b is the imaginary part.

You can assume that 10000  a  10000, and 10000  b  10000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output should consist of a single positive natural number N in one line, indicating
the power such that (a + b  i)N is real and its absolute value is not greater than 230. If there is no
solution, you have to output TOO COMPLICATED.

```

## Sample Output

```text
5
817 0
2 2
0 -1
18 92
-7 7
