## Input

```
In this problem, youre to write a formula editor. Technically, a formula is an expression, which is a
sequence of elements. There are 3 kinds of elements: basic elements (arithmetic operator, parenthesis,
digit and letters), matrices and fractions (discussed below).

The editor builds an invisible box for the expression being edited. Since the cells of a matrix are also
expressions, each cell has a box enclosing it. Similarly, the denominator and numerator of a fraction
are both expressions, so each of them has a box.

In the expression above, there are 5 boxes. F1 is encloses the whole expression, F2 and F3 enclose
two matrix cells, F4 encloses the numerator and F5 encloses the denominator.

Its not difficult to see that boxes are nested. If box A directly contain box B, we say box A is the
parent box of box B (for example, F1 is the parent of F2 and F3, and F3 is the parent of F4 and F5; If
box A and box B have the same parent box, we say theyre sibling boxes (for example, F4 and F5 are
siblings and F2 and F3 are siblings, too).

Cursor Movement
At any time, the cursor is always directly contained in a box. It might be to the left of all the

elements in the box (i.e. at head position), to the right of all the elements (i.e. at tail position), or
between two consecutive elements. If the cursor is between element x and y, and x is to the left (so y
is to the right), we say the cursors immediate left element is x, and immediate right element is y.

The cursor supports six kinds of movements: HOME, END, and four arrow directions. Let A be
the inner-most box that contains the cursor, then

Home(End): place the cursor at the head(tail) position of A (its still directly in A!).
Up(Down): If A has a sibling box to its up(down) direction, place the cursor at the head position of
B, otherwise check As parent box (if As parent box has a sibling...). If none of As ancestor boxes
have such a sibling box, do nothing for this command.

Left(Right): There are four cases.

 If the cursor is at the head(tail) position of A, then place the cursor at the tail(head) position of
As left(right) sibling B. If there is no such B, place the cursor directly in the As parent box C,
to the immediate left(right) of A.

 If the cursors immediate left(right) element is a fraction, place the cursor at the tail(head) position
of the numerator.

 If the cursors immediate left(right) element is a matrix with n rows and m rows, then place the
cursor to the tail(head) position of the box at row [n/2] and column 1(column m).

 If the cursors immediate left(right) element is a basic element, then place the cursor to the
immediate left(right) of that element.

Output Formatting
The formula is output in ASCII format. Each box is formatted as an ASCII rectangle (though most

of them are spaces), which is the horizontal concatenation of the ASCII rectangles of all its elements
(inner rectangles). Inner rectangles are aligned with their base lines (will be explained shortly). There
are no spaces between consecutive elements, and there are no extra lines or columns between the inner
rectangles and the boundary of the outer rectangle.

Each element is also formatted as an ASCII rectangle:

 Basic elements occupy exactly one line, which is also the base line. We use three characters  -
 (that is, one space at each side) to represent the subtraction operator, and all other elements is
formatted as a single character.

 A matrix is formatted as follows: first, format all the boxes of the matrix cells, and then arrange
them into a matrix. The boxes in the same row are aligned according to the base lines, and
the boxes in the same column are aligned horizontally. Consecutive rows are separated by an
empty line, and consecutive columns are separated by an empty column. Finally, a pair of square
brackets is added to the both sides of base lines for each row. The base line of the whole matrix
is the base line of the center row if there are an odd number of rows. Otherwise, the base line of
the whole matrix is the center empty line.

 A fraction is formatted as follows: first, format the denominators box and the numerators box,
then draw a horizontal line (a sequence of - characters) between these two, which is also the
base line of the whole fraction. The width of the line is the larger value of two widths, plus 2 (i.e.
one more - on both sides). The denominator and the numerator are aligned horizontally.

Note that when aligning rectangles horizontally, we fix the position of the widest rectangle, and try
to move other rectangles so that their center columns have the same horizontal position of the widest
rectangle. When this is not possible (i.e. for rectangles whose width has a different parity from the
widest one), we can move these troublesome rectangles 0.5 unit to the left of the ideal position, like
this:

XXXX
------
XXX

There is a special case: if the expression is empty, the formatted ASCII rectangle is an empty line,
i.e. its width is zero, but its height is one. Naturally, the empty line is the base line.
Input Handling

The input of the editor is already converted to a sequence of command strings. For each string:

 If it contains a single character, it must be a basic element. Insert that element at the cursor,
and move the cursor to its immediate right.

 If it is Matrix or Fraction, then insert an 11 matrix or an empty fraction at the cursor, then
move the cursor right once. Note that, before moving the cursor right, the new matrix/fraction
is to immediate right of the cursor.

 If it is AddRow or AddCol, insert a row/column before the box that directly contains the cursor
and place the cursor in the new row/column of the same column/row. If the box is not a matrix
cell, check its parent box, until a matrix cell is found. If there is no matrix cell containing the
cursor, ignore the command.

 If it is one of Home, End, Left, Right, Up, Down, follow the cursor movement rules above.
```

## Output

```
There will be several test cases. Each test case contains a series of command strings, one in each
line, ending with command Done followed by an empty line. Note that the resulting formula is not
necessarily mathematically correct. There will be at most 1000 commands in each test case, and the
whole input size does not exceed 200KB.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the final formula in ASCII form. Print the case number in the first line, then
an empty line after the formula. Dont print any trailing spaces, but dont omit empty lines (e.g. there
is an empty line at the end of sample output 3).

Hint
This problem is tricky. Please make sure your program can pass the test cases in the gift package

in the contest 295 website.
