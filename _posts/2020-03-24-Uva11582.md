title: Uva 11582  Colossal Fibonacci Numbers
---


## Input

```

Oooh...pretty

The ith Fibonacci number f(i) is recur-
sively defined in the following way:

 f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1

 f(i+ 2) = f(i+ 1) + f(i) for every
i  0

Your task is to compute some values
of this sequence.
```

## Output

```
Input begins with an integer t  10, 000,
the number of test cases. Each test case
consists of three integers a, b, n where
0  a, b < 264 (a and b will not both be
zero) and 1  n  1000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single line containing the remainder of f(ab) upon division by n.

```

## Sample Output

```
