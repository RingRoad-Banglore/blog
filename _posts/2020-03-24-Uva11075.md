## Input

```text
Little Johny has just learned to play around with a photo editing tool. He has become quite an expert
in a very short time. His signature works are some wonderful collages created by pasting clipped parts
of different photographs one on top of another.

While we dont have the time and tool to play like Johny, we do have the luxury to simplify the task
to mold it into a rather simple problem.

Our clipped photographs are fixed sized character grids representing some patterns. Parts of the
grids may be filled with the dot . character representing transparent pixels, and the remaining opaque
pixels would be represented with lower case letters. Here are two sample grids representing some
patterns:

..xxx .....

.x..x .....

....x .oo..
x...x ..o..
.xx.. ..o..
Grid 1 Grid 2

To keep it simple, we would use the same lower case letter in one grid. The lower case letter in one
grid may or may not be used in another grid.

Our task is to place these grids one on top of another in such a way that we can come up with a
target pattern (possibly of different size). Placing the grids one on another is simple, we dont have to
bother about rotation, reflection, or any such transformation except for translation. We need to ensure
that an opaque pixel does not hide another opaque pixel. Some part of a grid may be outside the Target
Image when the part outside, contains only transparent pixels. The following example shows valid and
invalid merging of Grid 1 and Grid 2:

..xxx. ..xxx. ..xxx.

.x..x. .xoox. .oo.x.

..oox. ...ox. ..o.x.
x..ox. x..ox. x.o.x.
.xxo.. .xx... .xx...

Target 1 Target 2 Target 3
Valid Valid Invalid

Given the grids representing the patterns and a grid representation of the target pattern itself, we
want to know whether it is possible to produce the target. As we can see, given Grid 1 and Grid 2, we
could produce Target 1 and Target 2, but not Target 3.

## Output

```text
There can be several test cases. The first line of input gives you the number of test cases, T (1 
T  1000). Then T test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of grids N (1  N  14)
representing the given patterns. Each of the patterns is represented by a 5  5 grid containing lower
case letters and dots only. A blank line would follow every pattern. At the end of the N patterns, the
target pattern would be given. Two integers R, C (1  R,C  20) will give the dimension of the grid
representing the target. In the next R lines, the RC grid would present the target pattern. As with
the N patterns, the target would contain lower case letters and dots only. There will be a blank line
following this pattern.

## Sample Input

```text
For each of the test cases, youd have to print the serial number (Case x:) of the test case followed by
Yes or No depending on whether the target can be reached or not. You should note that to achieve
the target you must use each and every given pattern for that test case exactly once. If there are
duplicate patterns in a test case, you must treat them as separate entities.
