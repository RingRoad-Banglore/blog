title: Uva 11660  Look-and-Say sequences
---


## Input

```text
A look-and-say sequence is a sequence of integers, expressed in decimal notation, where each sucessive
term is generated by describing the previous one.

For instance, if x1 (the first term of the sequence) is 1, the next term is the description of this term,
11 (one 1), which is described by 21 (two 1s), which is described by 1211 (one 2 one 1), etc.; the
series continues 111221, 312211, 13112221, ...

Your problem is to build a program that, given the first term of a look-and-say sequence x1, calculates
the j-th digit of the i-th term, xi.
```

## Output

```text
Each line in the input corresponds to a test case specified by 3 integer values: x1, i and j, with
1  x1  1000, 1  i  1000 and 1  j  min(log10(xi) + 1, 1000). The end of the input is indicated
by a line 0 0 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the program must output a line with the j-th digit of the term xi of the look-and-say
sequence that starts with the term x1.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1 3 1
1 3 2
1 7 2
123 3 1
0 0 0

```
