```
Passing time, walking the passage, as you pass the String Parsing Department(abbreviated SPaDe), you
pause, amazed at them by parsing strings way past midnight. At the SPaDe , they are overwhelmed
with the stringent requirements to compression recently introduced by the SPaDes director, Dr. Spade.
Any string longer than 4 characters must now be compressed as much as possible, Dr. Spade dictates!
If a string can be expressed shorter, so it must be!, he shouts.

He then yells that abababab can be ex-
pressed as just (ab)4 which is only 5 symbols,
a whole saving of 3 symbols, and everyone in
the Department breaks out in a song of cele-
bration, chanting:

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why
This is why
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why
This is why
This is why I'm hot

but of course given in its compressed form

(This is why I'm hot)2
(This is why)2
(This is why I'm hot)3
(This is why)3
I'm hot

Given a string S over the alphabet {a,b,c,d} as input, output the length of its most compressed
version. The SPaDe has yet to discover nested compression as in ((a)2b)3 so use only one-level
compression
```

## Input

```
The first line contains an integer T (1  T  100), the number of test cases. For each test case there
is a line with a string S (5  |S|  100).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print on a separate line the minimum length of S after the compression described
above.

Note: The string from the second example can be compressed into d(abba)2ba(d)5cccc(b)12.
