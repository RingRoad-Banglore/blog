title: Uva 01359  Hills
---


## Input

```

This sample figure only contains a
single hill

Little Billy likes drawing with chalks of all colors. As a child of
his age, all he can do is to draw straight lines. Today he has
been told that hills are of the shape of triangles, and he brought
out a lot of his works and tried to identify as many hills as he
could. Being one of his best friends, you gladly joined his effort.
However after working for a while you are desperate to find the
huge number of sketches he has produced. You suggested this
alternative plan  to code up a program for him.

Keep in mind that in Billys pictures all the lines are con-
nected, and no line will have an end point right on another line.
We would only count the hills that are not cut by other lines.
```

## Output

```
Standard input will contain multiple test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T (1 
T  10) which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow, each preceded by a single blank line.

Each test case starts with an integer N (1 < N  500), which is the number of lines on the
picture. The next N lines contain a line segments two end points. The coordinates are all integers
(10, 000 < x, y < 10, 000).

```

## Sample Input

```
Results should be directed to standard output. Start each case with Case #: on a single line, where
# is the case number starting from 1. Two consecutive cases should be separated by a single blank
line. No blank line should be produced after the last test case.

For each test case, print the number of hills on a single line.
