## Input

```text

As we all know, teams participating in ICPC or in any of the previous regionals receive one balloon for
each problem solved. At the end of the contest, the team with more balloons wins.

As part of the selection process, the candidate members of our team for the next Southwestern
Europe Regional Contest need to prove that they know how to handle our new secret weapon: an USB
controlled laser cannon. In the highly unlikely case that our team got less balloons than some other
team, they would use the laser cannon to burst other teams balloons.

We will assume that the contest takes place in a two dimensional room and that the only objects
in the room are the target balloons and the laser cannon. Further, our laser has infinite range and the
balloons are perfect circles. The cannon is in the lower left corner of the room (which has coordinates
(0, 0)). Hence, to aim the cannon, the user only has to select the proper elevation angle.

Unfortunately, the laser cannon is a cheap model from ACME that can only fire at elevations from 0
sexagesimal degrees up to 90, in increments of 10 degrees. Also, it sometimes gets stuck when lowering
the muzzle, hence if several shots are to be fired, it is important to fire them in order from lowest to
higher elevation angle.

You have to write a program to calculate at which elevations the cannon has to be fired and how
many balloons will be burst, given the size and coordinates of all the target balloons.

## Output

```text
The input format is as follows:
An integer in a single line which says the number of problems to solve. Then, for each problem:

 An integer in a line of itself denoting the number of target balloons.

 One line for each balloon, with three integers giving the coordinates (x, y) of each balloon and its
diameter (all distances are given in centimeters). No balloon is further than 15 meters from the
cannon and all balloons are smaller than 1 meter in diameter.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output for each problem consists of one line for each shoot of the form Fire laser at d degrees.,
where d is the elevation for the shot, followed by a line indicating how many balloons have actually been
burst in the form 1 burst balloon. when only one balloon has been burst, No balloon burst. if
no balloon has been harmed and b burst balloons. if b balloons have been hit and b > 1.

Note: The following figures are diagrams showing the positions of the balloons in the first two sample
problems and all the possible firing elevations:
