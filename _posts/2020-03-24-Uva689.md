title: Uva 00689  Napoleons Grumble
---


```
Legend has it that, after being defeated in Waterloo, Napoleon Bonaparte, in retrospect of his days of
glory, talked to himself Able was I ere I saw Elba. Although, it is quite doubtful that he should have
said this in English, this phrase is widely known as a typical palindrome.

A palindrome is a symmetric character sequence that looks the same when read backwards, right to
left. In the above Napoleons grumble, white spaces appear at the same positions when read backwards.
This is not a required condition for a palindrome. The following, ignoring spaces and punctuation marks,
are known as the first conversation and the first palindromes by human beings.

Madam, Im Adam.
Eve.
(by Mark Twain)

Write a program that finds palindromes in input lines.
```

## Input

```
A multi-line text is given as the input. The input ends at the end of the file.

There are at most 100 lines in the input. Each line has less than 1024 Roman alphabet characters.

```

## Output

```
Corresponding to each input line, a line consisting of all the character sequences that are palindromes in
the input line should be output. However, trivial palindromes consisting of only one or two characters
should not be reported.

On finding palindromes, any characters in the input except Roman alphabets, such as punctuation
characters, digits, spaces, and tabs, should be ignored. Characters that differ only in their cases should
be looked upon as the same character. Whether or not the character sequences represent a proper
English word or sentence does not matter.

Palindromes should be reported all in uppercase characters. When two or more palindromes are
reported, they should be separated by a space character. You must report palindromes in lexicographical
order.

If two or more occurrences of the same palindromes are found in the same input line, report only
once. When a palindrome overlaps with another, even when one is completely included in the other, both
should be reported. However, palindromes appearing in the center of another palindrome, whether or
not they also appear elsewhere, should not be reported. For example, for an input line of AAAAAA, two
palindromes AAAAAA and AAAAA should be output, but not AAAA nor AAA. For AAABCAAAAAA,
the output remains the same.

One line should be output corresponding to one input line. If an input line does not contain any
palindromes, an empty line should be output.
Note:

The second line in the output is empty, corresponding to the second input line containing no
palindromes. Also note that some of the palindromes in the third input line, namely ADA, MIM,
AMIMA, DAMIMAD, and ADAMIMADA, are not reported because they appear at the center of reported
ones. MADAM is reported, as it does not appear in the center, but only once, disregarding its second
occurrence.
