title: Uva 11549  Calculator Conundrum
---


## Input

```text
Alice got a hold of an old calculator that can display n digits. She was bored enough to come up with
the following time waster.

She enters a number k then repeatedly squares it until the result overflows. When the result
overflows, only the n most significant digits are displayed on the screen and an error flag appears. Alice
can clear the error and continue squaring the displayed number. She got bored by this soon enough,
but wondered:

Given n and k, what is the largest number I can get by wasting time in this manner?
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer t (1  t  200), the number of test cases. Each test case
contains two integers n (1  n  9) and k (0  k < 10n) where n is the number of digits this calculator
can display k is the starting number.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the maximum number that Alice can get by repeatedly squaring the starting
number as described.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
1 6
2 99

```
