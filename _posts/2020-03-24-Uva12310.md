## Input

```
Given a partition of the plane into disjoint regions
(i.e. a planar subdivision), your task is to determine
the region where each query point lies (We use labels
to distinguish the regions, see below).

The planar subdivision will be given as a planar
straight-line graph (PSLG) with every vertex having
at least two adjacent vertices. The two sides of each
segment will always belong to different regions.

Here is a sample PSG with 5 regions in the picture
below (dont forget there is an exterior infinite region
outside the PSGL):
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 10 test cases. Each test case
begins with four integers n, m, p, q (1  n  10, 000,
1  m  30, 000, 1  p  20, 000, 1  q  100, 000), where n and m are the number of vertices
and edges in PSLG, p is the number of labels, q is number of queries. The next n lines contain the
coordinates of the vertices (coordinates are integers whose absolute values do not exceed 1,000,000).
The next m lines contain the edges of the PSGL (vertices are numbered 1 to n). There will be no self-
loops or parallel-edges. No two edges will be crossing each other at non-endpoints, and each vertex will
be connected to at least two edges, and the two sides of each edge will always belong to different regions.
The next p lines contain the coordinates of the labels (numbered 1 to p). There will be at most one label
strictly inside each region (including the infinite region) of the PSGL. The vertices of the PSGL will be
connected. The next q lines contain the coordinates of the query points (coordinates are real numbers
whose absolute values do not exceed 1,000,000). The input terminates with n = m = p = q = 0, which
should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each query, print the label of the region in which the query point lies. If the region does not have
a label, print 0. It is guaranteed that for each label and query point, the distance to the boundary of
its region will be at least 0.0001.
