title: Uva 11671  Sign of a Matrix
---


```
You have a n  n zero matrix. In each operation, you can add
one (or minus 1) to every element of a whole row, or add one (or
minus 1) to every element of a whole column. Given the target
signs of every element of the matrix, how many operations are
needed?
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 100 test cases. Each test case begins with
a line containing a single integer n (2  n  100), followed by n lines of n characters in each line. Each
character is one of +, - or 0, corresponding to positive, negative and zero, respectively.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the minimum number of operations needed. If the target
cannot be reached, print -1.

Sample elaboration:
For the first sample input, target can be achieved by 3 moves only. By increasing the second column

twice and decreasing the second row once. Which will convert the initial matrix to the following

0 +2 0 0
-1 +1 -1 -1
0 +2 0 0
0 +2 0 0

Which is the target matrix.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
0+00
-+--
0+00
0+00
2
+0
00
-1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 3
Case 2: -1
```
