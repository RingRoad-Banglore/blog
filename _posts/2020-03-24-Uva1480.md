## Input

```text

Jimmy wants to make a special necklace for his girlfriend. He bought many beads with various sizes,
and no two beads are with the same size. Jimmy cant remember all the details about the beads, for
the necklace is so long. So he turns to you for help.

Initially, there is no bead at all, that is, there is an empty chain. Jimmy always sticks the new
bead to the right of the chain, to make the chain longer and longer. We number the leftmost bead as
Position 1, and the bead to its right as Position 2, and so on. Jimmy usually asks questions about the
beads positions, size ranks and actual sizes. Specifically speaking, there are 4 kinds of operations you
should process:

Insert x: Put a bead with size x to the right of the chain (0 < x < 231, and x is different from all
the sizes of beads currently in the chain)

Query 1 s t k: Query the k-th smallest bead between position s and t, inclusive. You can assume
1  s  t  L, (L is the length of the current chain), and 1  k  min(100, t s+ 1)

Query 2 x: Query the rank of the bead with size x, if we sort all the current beads by ascent order of
sizes. The result should between 1 and L (L is the length of the current chain)

Query 3 k: Query the size of the k-th smallest bead currently (1  k  L, L is the length of the
current chain)
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases in the input. The first line for each test case is an integer N , indicating the
number of operations. Then N lines follow, each line contains one operation, as described above.

You can assume the amount of Insert operation is no more than 100000, and the amounts of
Query_1, Query_2 and Query_3 are all less than 35000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output 4 lines for each test case. The first line is Case T:, where T is the id of the case. The next 3
lines indicate the sum of results for Query_1, Query_2 and Query_3, respectively.

Explanation for the sample: The answers for the 5 queries are 6, 4, 3, 4, 1, respectively.
