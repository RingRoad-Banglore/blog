263 Number Chains
Given a number, we can form a number chain by

1. arranging its digits in descending order

2. arranging its digits in ascending order

3. subtracting the number obtained in (2) from the number obtained (1) to form a new number

4. and repeat these steps unless the new number has already appeared in the chain

Note that 0 is a permitted digit. The number of distinct numbers in the chain is the length of the
chain. You are to write a program that reads numbers and outputs the number chain and the length
of that chain for each number read.

## Input
The input consists of a sequence of positive numbers, all less than 109, each on its own line, terminated
by ‘0’. The input file contains at most 5000 numbers.

## Output
The output consists of the number chains generated by the input numbers, followed by their lengths
exactly in the format indicated below. After each number chain and chain length, including the last
one, there should be a blank line. No chain will contain more than 1000 distinct numbers.

## Sample Input
<p>123456789</p><p>1234</p><p>444</p><p>0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
