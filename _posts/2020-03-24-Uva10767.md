Quite recently the City of Barcelona has included trams to its
efficient public transport. As expected, the result has been a
nice set of accidents of outstanding originality and beauty. Di-
minishing aesthetic reasons, the Major of Barcelona has decided
to reduce the delay caused by the accidents. After a thorough
study the following model has been established:

Every tram must go from an initial point P0 to a final point
Pn visiting the intermediate points P1, , Pn1 in this order. For
every 1  i  n, let Si be the section going from Pi1 to Pi.
Every such section must be traveled at uniform speed vi, which
is chosen by the driver at Pi1. Let Mi be the maximum possible
speed of the tram at Si, and assume that the chosen speed is
0 < vi  Mi. Then the probability of crashing in Si is vi/Mi. When a crash happens, the tram uses an
efficient recovery system that lasts only 10 seconds. Afterwards, the tram reaches Pi using an auxiliary
(slow but safe) engine, which provides a speed of 5 meters per second and guarantees no more crashes
in Si.

For instance, assume that the section length is 300 meters, and that the current maximum speed
is 25 meters per second. If the driver chooses to travel at 25 m/s, the tram will crash for sure. Since
the crash can happen anywhere between Pi1 and Pi, for the sake of computation we can assume that
it will take place exactly in the middle point (after 150 meters). Therefore, on the average the tram
will spend 6 seconds to reach the middle point, 10 seconds to recover from the crash, and 30 seconds to
reach Pi, for a total of 46 seconds. By contrast, if the tram starts traveling at 15 m/s, with probability
0.6 it will crash and spend 10 + 10+ 30 = 50 seconds, and with probability 0.4 it will reach Pi after 20
seconds without any crash. The average time in this case is thus just 0.6  50 + 0.4  20 = 38 seconds.

When the tram reaches every Pi, it stops for a few seconds regardless of having had a crash in Si
or not; these few seconds (for simplicity we consider them to be 0) are enough to (almost) repair the
tram: the maximum speed reduces by 1 m/s after every crash. If we call the initial maximum speed
M0, then we have Mi = M0  Ci, where 0  Ci  i  1 is the total number of crashes suffered in S1,
, Si1.

Write a program that prints the optimal average travel time given the initial maximum speed and
the length of every section.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of zero ore more test cases. Each test case consists of a line with M0 (a real number
between 5 and 25), n (an integer number between 1 and M0  1), and the length of every section (each
a real number between 100 and 1000).

```

## Output

```
For every test case, print the optimal average travel time with four decimal digits.
