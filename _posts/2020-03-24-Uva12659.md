```

Data in spreadsheets are stored in cells, which are organized in rows (r) and columns (c). Some
operations on spreadsheets can be applied to single cells (r, c), while others can be applied to entire
rows or columns. Typical cell operations include inserting and deleting rows or columns and exchanging
cell contents.

Some spreadsheets allow users to mark collections of rows or columns for deletion, so the entire
collection can be deleted at once. Some (unusual) spreadsheets allow users to mark collections of rows
or columns for insertions too. Issuing an insertion command results in new rows or columns being
inserted before each of the marked rows or columns.

Suppose, for example, the user marks rows 1 and 5 of the spreadsheet on the left for deletion, then
marks columns 3, 6, 7, and 9 for deletion, the spreadsheet shrinks to spreadsheet on the right:

If the user marks rows 2, 3 and 5 for insertion, then marks column 3 for insertion, the spreadsheet
grows to the one below:

Now that someone damaged your spreadsheet by issuing several insertion, deletion and exchange
operations (details are described below).

Your task is to calculate the number of cells that are kept (not deleted), and the total distance
between the original cells and their final locations. If a cell in (x1, y1) was moved to (x2, y2), the total
distance is increased by |x1  x2| + |y1  y2|. You also need to determine the final locations of some
important data.

## Input

```
The input consists of a sequence of spreadsheets, operations on those spreadsheets, and queries about
them. Each spreadsheet definition begins with a pair of integers specifying its initial number of rows (r)
and columns (c), followed by an integer specifying the number (n) of spreadsheet operations. Row and

column labeling begins with 1. The following n lines specify the desired operations. 1  r, c  5000,
1  n  50. There will be at least one row and one column at any time.

An operation to exchange the contents of cell (r1, c1) with (r2, c2) is given by: EX r1 c1 r2 c2. The
four insert and delete commands  DC (delete columns), DR (delete rows), IC (insert columns), and
IR (insert rows) are given by: < command > A x1 x2 . . . xA, where < command > is one of the four
commands; A is a positive integer not greater than 5, and x1, . . . , xA are the labels of the columns or
rows to be deleted or inserted before. For each insert and delete command, the order of the rows or
columns in the command has no significance. Within a single delete or insert command, labels will be
unique.

The operations are followed by an integer Q (Q  10000), which is the number of queries for the
spreadsheet. Each query consists of positive integers r and c, representing the row and column number
of a cell in the original spreadsheet. For each query, your program must determine the current location
of the data that was originally in cell (r, c).

The end of input is indicated by a row consisting of a pair of zeros for the spreadsheet dimensions.

```

## Output

```
For each spreadsheet, your program must output its sequence number (starting at 1). In the next line,
your program must output the number of cells that are kept, and the total move distance.

For each query, your program must output the original cell location followed by the final location
of the data or the word GONE if the contents of the original cell location were destroyed as a result of
the operations.

Separate output from different spreadsheets with a blank line.
