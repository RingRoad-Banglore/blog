Figure 1: If we connect six points on the
boundary of a circle, at most 31 regions are

created.

Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics chiefly con-
cerned with counting discrete objects. For instance,
how many ways can you pick two people out of a
crowd of n people? Into how many regions can you
divide a circular disk by connecting n points on its
boundary with one another? How many cubes are in
a pyramid with square layers ranging from 1  1 to
n n cubes?

Many questions like these have answers that can
be reduced to simple polynomials in n. The answer
to the first question above is n(n1)/2, or (n2n)/2.
The answer to the second is (n46n3+23n218n+
24)/24. The answer to the third is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6,
or (2n3 + 3n2 + n)/6. We write these polynomials in
a standard form, as a polynomial with integer coeffi-
cients divided by a positive integer denominator.

These polynomials are answers to questions that
can have integer answers only. But since they have
fractional coefficients, they look as if they could pro-
duce non-integer results! Of course, evaluating these
particular polynomials on a positive integer always results in an integer. For other polynomials of
similar form, this is not necessarily true. It can be hard to tell the two cases apart. So that, naturally,
is your task.

## Input

```
The input consists of multiple test cases, each on a separate line. Each test case is an expression
in the form (P)/D, where P is a polynomial with integer coefficients and D is a positive integer
denominator. P is a sum of terms of the form Cn^E, where the coefficient C and the exponent E
satisfy the following conditions:

1. E is an integer satisfying 0  E  100. If E is 0, then Cn^E is expressed as C. If E is 1, then
Cn^E is expressed as Cn, unless C is 1 or -1. In those instances, Cn^E is expressed as n or
n.

2. C is an integer. If C is 1 or -1 and E is not 0 or 1, then the Cn^E will appear as n^E or
n^E.

3. Only non-negative C values that are not part of the first term in the polynomial are preceded by
+.

4. Exponents in consecutive terms are strictly decreasing.

5. C and D fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

See the sample input for details.
Input is terminated by a line containing a single period.

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number (starting with 1). Then print Always an integer if the test
case polynomial evaluates to an integer for every positive integer n. Print Not always an integer
otherwise. Print the output for separate test cases on separate lines. Your output should follow the
same format as the sample output.
