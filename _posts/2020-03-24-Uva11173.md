Gray hair is Gods graffiti.

Bill Cosby

We are going to generate a sequence of integers in binary. Start with the sequence

0
1


Reflect it in the horizontal line, prepend a zero to the numbers in the top half and a one to the
numbers on the bottom and you will get

00
01
11
10

Repeat this again, and you will have 8 numbers

000 0
001 1
011 3
010 2
110 6
111 7
101 5
100 4

The corresponding decimal values are shown on the right.
These sequences are called Reflected Gray Codes for 1, 2 and 3 bits respectively. A Gray Code for n

bits is a sequence of 2n different n-bit integers with the property that every two neighbouring integers
differ in exactly one bit. A Reflected Gray Code is a Gray Code constructed in the way shown above.
```

## Input

```
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N (at most 250000). N test cases follow. Each one is
a line with 2 integers: n (1  n  30) and k (0  k < 2n).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the integer that appears in position k of the n-bit Reflected Gray Code.
