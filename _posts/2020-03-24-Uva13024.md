## Input

```text
Portos Festa de So Joo is one of Europes liveliest street festi-
vals. Its peak is the night of 23rd to 24th of June, with dancing
parties from Ribeira to Foz all night long.

Time to celebrate, with friends, relatives, neighbours or sim-
ply with other people in streets, armed with colored plastic ham-
mers, huge garlic flowers or a bunch of lemongrass to gently greet
passers-by. Fireworks, grilled sardines, barbecues, bonfires, pot-
ted basil plants (manjericos) and the sky covered by incandescent
sky lanterns (bales de S.Joo) launched from every corner make
this party unique.

The sky lanterns are made of thin paper and cannot be re-
leased until they are filled in with hot air. Sometimes they burn
out still on ground or on the way up, if a sudden gust of wind
catches them. For this reason, the successful launchers usually
follow the movement of their sky lanterns, with a mixture of anx-
iety and joy, for as long as they can distinguish them in the sky.

We are not aware of any attempt to achieve a Guinness record
of sky lanterns launched simultaneously (it could be dreadful
night for firemen if there were).

Can you imagine, thousands of people preparing their sky
lanterns for release at the city park, within a region of larger ones that will be launched simultaneously?

The large sky lanterns can be used to identify their positions in the sky afterwards, in order to count
the surviving ones at an observation instant.

Given the positions of the large sky lanterns and the positions of the small ones, determine the
number of small sky lanterns that are in the interior or on the boundary of some triangle defined by
any three of the large ones.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line has an integer L that defines the number of the large sky lanterns at the observation
instant. Each of the following L lines contains a pair of integers separated by a space that gives the
coordinates (x, y) of a large sky lantern. After that, there is a line with an integer S that defines the
number of small sky lanterns and S lines, each defining the position of a small sky lantern. The height
is irrelevant for us. All the given points are distinct and there are at least three points representing
large sky lanterns that are not collinear.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output has a single line with the number of small sky lanterns that are in the
interior or on the boundary of some triangle defined by any three of the large sky lanterns.

Constraints:
3  L  10 000 Number of large sky lanterns.
1  S  50 000 Number of small sky lanterns.
0  x, y  230 Bounds for coordinates.
