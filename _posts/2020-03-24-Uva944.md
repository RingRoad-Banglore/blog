title: Uva 00944  Happy Numbers
---


## Input

```text

Let the sum of the squares of the digits of a positive integer s0 be represented by s1. In a similar way,
let the sum of the squares of the digits of s1 be represented by s2, and so on. If si = 1 for some i  1,
then the original integer s0 is said to be happy. For example, starting with 7 gives the sequence

7,49(= 7  2),97(= 4  2 + 9  2),130(= 9  2 + 7  2),10(= 1  2 + 3  2),1(= 1  2),

so 7 is a happy number.
The first few happy numbers are 1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, 28, 31, 32, 44, 49, 68, 70, 79, 82, 86, 91, 94,

97, 100, . . . The number of iterations i required for these to reach 1 are, respectively, 1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 4,
3, 4, 5, 5, 3, . . .

A number that is not happy is called unhappy. Once it is known whether a number is happy
(unhappy), then any number in the sequence s1, s2, s3, . . . will also be happy (unhappy). Unhappy
numbers have eventually periodic sequences of si which do not reach 1 (e.g., 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42,
20, 4, . . .).

Any permutation of the digits of a happy (unhappy) number must also be happy (unhappy). This
follows from the fact that addition is commutative. Moreover, the product of a happy (unhappy)
number by any power of ten is a happy (unhappy) number. Example: 58 is an unhappy number; then,
so are 85, 580, 850, 508, 805, 5800, 5080, 5008, 8050, 8500, and so on.

Decide which numbers, in a given closed interval, are happy numbers.

## Output

```text
The input has n lines each of them corresponding to test case. Every line contains two positive integers
between 1 and 99999 each; the first integer, L, is the low limit of the closed interval; the second one,
H, is the high limit (L  H).

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output is composed of the happy numbers that lie in the interval [L,H], together with the number
of iterations required for the corresponding sequences of squares to reach 1.

There must be a line for each happy number containing the happy number followed by a space and
the number of iterations required for the sequence of squares to reach 1.

Print a blank line between two consecutive test cases.
