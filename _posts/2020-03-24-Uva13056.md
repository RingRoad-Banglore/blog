title: Uva 13056  Jerrys Game
---


## Input

```text
Tom and Jerry are very fond of cat and mice games, which might be rather obvious to you. Today they
are playing a very complicated game. The goals are simple as usual though, Jerry would be running
and Tom would have to catch Jerry.

However, today Jerry is running on a perfect circular
path with radius R meters, at a constant speed of V m/s.
Initially Tom is sitting at the very center of the circle. He
wants to catch Jerry as soon as possible, but we all know,
Tom is not very intelligent. Instead of calculating an op-
timal direction to catch Jerry, he is just running towards
Jerry.

As Jerry is also moving, the path Tom has taken starts
to look like a curve (see picture above). At any given mo-
ment, Toms position is between Jerrys current position
and the center of the circle. Tom is also moving at a con-
stant speed of V m/s, same speed as Jerry. Find the time
(in seconds) Tom would need to catch Jerry.
```

## Output

```text
Input file has T (T  10000) test cases, each case consists of two integer R and V . Here, 0 < R, V 
10000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and the time Tom will need to catch Jerry. Floating point
rounding error lower than 105 will be ignored by the judge.

```

## Sample Output

```text

45 100
5 1547
1000 10000
5668 5467
