title: Uva 13180  The countess pearls
---


```
The countess pearl necklace is known for the quality and quantity
of its pearls. She wears it at big parties, giving it three or four
laps around her neck. The center pearl is the largest, and as
we move towards the ends they are strictly smaller. The pearls
are perfectly selected and placed, what makes the necklace fully
symmetrical with respect to the central pearl.

During the last dance, the closure broke and the pearls rolled
on the floor. The guests tried to retrieve them all by stranding
them on a new string as they were found. The next day, the
countess called her jeweler to put them back in the right order. The jeweler measures the diameter of
each pearl and proceeds to remake the collar placing first the central pearl and then the following ones
in size until arriving at the ends. The countess does not care if a pearl has been lost, as long as the
necklace remains completely symmetrical.
```

## Input

```
Each line of the entry forms a test case, consisting of a list of positive numbers separated by spaces. Each
one represents the diameter of one of the pearls in the order in which they were collected by the guests.
The perfection of the necklace is legendary, so the diameter is measured with a unit that many consider
infinitesimal, although the diameter will always be less than 231. Each list has 0 < pearls < 1,000 and
finishes always with a zero.

The last test case, which should not be processed, contains an empty collar, represented by a list
with a single zero.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the program writes NO if it is not possible to form a symmetrical collar with each
and every one of the pearls found, so that the larger pearl is in the center. Otherwise, the diameters of
the pearls will be written, separated by spaces, as they have been arranged in the collar, from one end
to the other.
