title: Uva 01661  Equation
---


## Input

```

Your task is to solve an equation of the form f(x) = 0 where f(x) is written in postfix notation with
numbers, operations +, -, *, /, and at most one occurrence of a variable x.

For example, f(x) for an equation (4x+ 2)/2 = 0 is written as:

4 X * 2 + 2 /

The solution for f(x) = 0 is x = 1/2.
```

## Output

```
The input file consists of several equations, each of them in a single line with at most 30 tokens separated
by spaces. Each token is either:

 a digit from 0 to 9;

 an operation +, -, *, or /;

 an uppercase letter X that denotes variable x.

The input file contains a correct representation of f(x) in postfix notation where token X occurs at
most once. There is no division by a constant zero in this equation, that is, there always exists a value
of x, such that f(x) can be evaluated without division by zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, write to the output file:

 X = p/q if equation f(x) = 0 has a single solution that can be represented with a simple fraction
p/q, where p and q are coprime integer numbers and q is positive.

 NONE if equation f(x) = 0 has no solution;

 MULTIPLE if equation f(x) = 0 has multiple solutions.

```

## Sample Output

```
4 X * 2 + 2 /

2 2 *

0 2 X / *

```
