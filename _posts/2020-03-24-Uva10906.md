## Input

```text
Do not get perplexed with the name of problem, it has nothing to do with integral calculus. We will
concentrate on integration of simple algebraic expressions.

Complex algebraic expressions consisting of integers, addition and multiplication operators and
parentheses can be represented by the following BNF notations

< expr >  < expr > + < term >
< expr >  < term >
< term >  < term >  < factor >
< term >  < factor >
< factor >  (< expr >)
< factor >  num

According to the above grammar, both operators are left associative and multiplication is given higher
precedence. So, 2+3  4 is same as 2+ (3  4). Similarly, 2 + 3 + 4 is same as (2+3) + 4. On the other
hand, (2 + 3) * 4 is different to 2 + 3  4. It may be surprising but 2 + 3 + 4 is different to 2 + (3 +
4) as in this case, the order of evaluation is different.-

2 + 3 + 4 2 + (3 + 4)
= 5 + 4 = 2 + 7
= 9 = 9

Consider the expression (2 + 3)  4 + (2 + 3)  5 + 6

The above picture depicts two different ways of representing the expression in hand if we follow the
given grammar. The left one is known as the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and the other one is DAG
(common sub-expression is handled once). Such a representation clearly shows the way of evaluating
an algebraic expression. Here, each non-leaf node is assigned a unique variable name. As a result, we
can have a sequence of simple expressions to evaluate the expression

a = 2 + 3 a = 2 + 3
b = a  4 b = a  4
c = 2 + 3 d = a  5
d = c  5 e = b+ d
e = b+ d f = e+ 6
f = e+ 6

In both cases, f denotes the original expression (2 + 3)  4 + (2 + 3)  5 + 6. Here, you have to
integrate a sequence of simple expressions into the original one. A simple expression will always be of
the form

variable = (variable|integer)(+|)(variable|integer)
For a given sequence of simple expressions, there can be several original expressions. Consider the

following cases

a = 2 + 3 b = (2 + 3)  4
b = a  4 b = ((2 + 3)  4)
Then b can be - b = ((2) + (3))  4

etc.

We need the first one, i.e. expression having minimum number of literals.

## Output

```text
The input file will start with an integer, T (1  T  100) denoting the number of tests. Each input will
start with a positive integer, N (1  N  50) which is the number of simple expressions. Subsequent
lines will contain the simple expressions defined above. The input will be valid, i.e. it will be always
possible to construct a correct expression. Also, variable names will be referenced once they have been
assigned. Either variable name or integers can have at most 10 characters. The integers will be always
positive here (no unary minus) and variable names will contain letters only. Spaces will be used to
separate numbers, variables and operators.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each input, print Expression #D: followed by the expression denoted by the last variable in the
list of simple expressions. Here D is the test number, starting from 1. The length of any expression
will not be greater than 5000.

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
2
A = 2 + 3
B = A + A
3
A = 2 + 3
B = A + 4
C = B + 5

```
