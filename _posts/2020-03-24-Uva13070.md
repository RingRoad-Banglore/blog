title: Uva 13070  Palm trees in the snow
---


## Input

```text
The mayor of Marbella, a beautiful coastal city of Spain, has received
a worrying weather forecast. The 29th of February a great snowfall is
expected at the sea level, which is something very unusual. The city
hall gardeners have warned him that some palm trees in the promenade
could overcome under the weight of the snow, and he is very worried
about the deterioration that the promenade could suffer in case many
palm trees fall.

The promenade is one of the most popular touristic places in the
city where lots of people meet in the beach bars in the hot summer.
The hundreds of palm trees that grow there provide for shadow and freshness. The gardening service
has made a big effort so do not miss any palm tree in the promenade. When a palm tree falls down
there isnt enough time for another one to grow before the summer, so in those places with a small
amount of palm trees it will not be possible to install beach bars because of the heat.

The weather service has estimated the weight of the snow falling on the palm trees. And the
gardeners have approximated the maximum weight that each palm tree will be able to resist standing.
With this information, the mayor wants to know which part of the promenade will be the most affected
one; more specifically, the longest strip in which, after the snowfall, a maximum of 5 palm trees will
remain standing.

## Output

```text
The first line contains the number of proof cases appearing below. Each proof case consists in the
following data: in the first line the weight in kilograms of the snow that the weather service has
estimated will fall on each palm tree (a natural number); in the following line the number of palm trees
in the promenade (bigger or equal than 1 and less or equal than 100,000) and the sequence of weights
in kilograms (natural numbers) that each palm tree can resist, from left to right.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each proof case write in a different line the length of the most affected strip, that is, the longest
which contains at most 5 palm trees standing.
