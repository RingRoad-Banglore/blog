## Input

```

The city AllSquared has been designed by many famous architects and engineers. The city lays in a
retangular area of nm squared miles where n is the height of the rectangle, and m is its width.

The streets are horizontal divisions distributed uniformly at every one mile, and the avenues are
vertical divisions also uniformly distributed at every one mile. Streets are numbered from north to
south, starting from zero; avenues from west to east, also starting from zero.

The figure (a) below portrays the city layout for n = 8 and m = 11. The city is also

divided in horizontal and vertical strips, with the intersection of these strips defining the city subregions
(counties). Figure (b) pictures a city divided into 12 counties.

Every county is associated with a vehicle circulation fee, which should be paid every time a car
enters the county. If the car origin is a street or avenue delimiting the county, there is no fee. For
example, in the above figure a car whose origin is street = 2 and avenue = 3 and whose target is street
= 2 and avenue = 9 will have to pay only the county crossing fee relative to avenue 6.

You should write a program that has the following input:

 two strictly positive integers n and m specifying the city dimensions;

 two positive integers h and v specifying the number of horizontal and vertical strips, respectively
(for the city in the figure, h = 4, v = 3);

 h  1 integers s1, . . . , sh1 (1  si  n  1) which denote the streets in which there is a county
division line (in the previous figure, the numbers are 1, 6, and 7);

 v  1 integers a1, . . . , av1 (1  ai  m 1) which denote the avenues in which there is a county
division line (in the the previous figure, the numbers are 3 and 6);

 the circulation fees for each county in the city, i.e., h  v positive integers

p11, p12, . . . , p1v
p21, p22, . . . , p2v
. . .
ph1, ph2, . . . , phv

where pij is the circulation fee for the county delimited by ai1 (west), ai+1 (east), sj1 (north),
and sj+1 (south);

 two pairs of positive integers local1 = (str1, av1) and local2 = (str2, av2)

The output should be the smallest possible price to pay for going from local1 to local2.
```

## Output

```
The input format may contain several instances of the problem. Each instance is terminated by a line
starting with % (percentage symbol).

The description for one instance has the following format:
n m
h v
s1 s2 . . . sh1
a1 a2 . . . av1
p11 p12 . . . p1v
p21 p22 . . . p2v
. . .
ph1 ph2 . . . phv
w1 t1 w2 t2
%

where

 n,m, h, v are integers such that 0 < h  n < 100, 0 < v  m < 100;

 s1, . . . , sh1 are such that 1  si  n 1 for 1  i  h 1;

 a1, . . . , av1 are such that 1  ai  m 1 for 1  i  v  1;

 pij are positive integers such that 0 < pij < 10000;

 w1, t1, w2, t2 are integers such that 0  w1, w2  n and 0  t1, t2  m. (w1, t1) is the origin and
(w2, t2) is the target point for the problem;

 there can be an arbitrary number of spaces or empty lines between the numbers in the file.

```

## Sample Input

```
For an input file with k instances of the problem, the output file should follow the format:

c1
c2
. . .

ck

where ci is the result for the i-th instance in the input file.
