title: Uva 01077  The Sky is the Limit
---


## Input

```
The city of Banff hired an advertising agency to promote the citys attractions to potential visitors.
One of the planned slogans stated that the mountain ranges around the city form the most beautiful
skyline in Canada. But the Institute for Consumer Protection in Canada (ICPC) decided that the
most beautiful skyline was a subjective and unverifiable claim, and could therefore be considered
misleading.

The advertising agency then came up with the slogan Banff - the longest skyline in Canada.
Although not as catchy, it is hopefully verifiable, and therefore admissible under Canadas tricky ad-
vertising laws.

This is where you come in. What the advertising agency needs is a program that determines the
length of a skyline. Consider each mountain as a two-dimensional triangle having two upper sides the
same length. A skyline is the outline of one or more mountains. The skylines length is the total length
of the outline. The left illustration below shows three mountains. The right illustration shows (with
bold lines) the skyline and (with dashed lines) the portion of the mountains upper edges that are not
part of the skyline. Note that parts of the horizon line that lie between mountains are not considered
part of the skyline.
```

## Output

```
Each input file contains one or more test cases, which are descriptions of mountain ranges. Each
description starts with a line containing a positive integer N , which specifies the number of mountains
in the range. Each of the next N lines describes a mountain with three integers X, H, and B, which
specify the horizontal position of the mountains peak relative to some fixed point, the height of the
peak, and the width of the base of the mountain, respectively. The base of each mountain coincides
with a horizontal line. The values satisfy the conditions N  100, H > 0, and B > 0.

The last test case is followed by a line containing a zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number (beginning with 1) and the length of the skyline. Print the
length rounded to the nearest integer, with 0.5 rounded up. Print a blank line after the output of each
test case. Use the format shown in the sample output below.
