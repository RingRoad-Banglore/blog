```
On the triangular field shown on the picture, small triangles are num-
bered from 1 to oo (infinity). Traveller wants to go from triangle M to
triangle N . Traveller can move only through the sides of triangles, not
vertices. The number of sides he crosses is called the path length.

You are to determine the shortest path from M to N .
```

## Input

```
The first line is the number of test cases, followed by a blank line.

Each test case of the input contains integers M and N (1  M,N 
1000000000), separated by some spaces.

Each test case will be separated by a single line.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, your programm should print the length of the shortest path from M to N .

Print a blank line between the outputs for two consecutive test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```
1

6 12

```

## Sample Output

```
3
