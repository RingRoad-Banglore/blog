title: Uva 12517  Digit Sum
---


## Input

```
The security system for Associated Computer Informatics Systems (ACIS) has an interesting test to
check the identity for authorized personal. These persons have got a piece of software that allowed
them to calculate, given two integer positive numbers M and N , what is the sum of the decimal digits
in the sequence M , M + 1, , N . Then, when somebody is trying to access ACIS system, he/she is
asked to answer the question of the sum for some M and N that are provided at that moment, by
means of the given software.

ACIS programmers have developed a rather nave algorithm only to verify that the method calculates
the right answer. Now they are interested in developing a faster algorithm, in order to stop unauthorized
users (who may be detected because they do not answer the sum question fast enough). And then you
have been hired to help ACIS programmers to find such a method.

## Output

```
The problem input consists of several cases, each one defined by a line with two integer numbers, M
and N , without leading blanks and separated by a blank. You may assume that 1  M  N  109.
The end of the input is signaled by a line with two zero values.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output a line with the sum of the decimal digits for the sequence M , M + 1, , N .

```

## Sample Output

```
3 8
5 18
1 50
0 0
