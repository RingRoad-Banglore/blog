## Input

```text
But, while he was shouting, he saw with surprise
That the moon of the evening was starting to rise
Up over his head in the darkening skies.

From the top of his tower of turtles, King Yertle sees the moon rising. As everyone knows, the
moon is made of green cheese and the best cheese in the world is produced in France. France has also
produced many great mathematicians including Descartes, Laplace and Fermat. Fermats famous last
theorem states that the equation

x^n+y^n=z^n

has no non-zero integer solutions for x, y and z when n > 2. For readability, this equation might be
better rendered

n n n
x + y = z

While it would be easy to render this equation and other mathematical expressions graphically
using TEX or LATEX, sometimes we want to include the expressions in text. Providing the TEX or LATEX
source for rendering the math is one possibility, but it isnt always easy to read, especially for low-TEX
people.

Handling all possible expressions would render this question intractable, but unary minus (-) and
the binary operators for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponentiation
(^) and equality (=) are sufficient for most math work. Remember that ^ associates right to left while
all of the other binary operators associate left to right.

The order of precedence for the operations is

1. unary - (highest)

2. ^

3. * and /

4. + and -

5. =

The grouping operators () (explicit) and {} (implicit) serve to usurp the usual order of operations.

## Output

```text
Input will consist of expressions using the above operators, real numbers (12, 1.2, .35, etc.) and single-
letter variables. All expressions will be syntactically valid; each expression will appear on a line by
itself. The format for a real number is a string of one or more decimal digits with an optional decimal
point occurring at any position. Support for exponents is not required.

## Sample Input

```text
Output will be complicated. The sample output will be useful for understanding the output specifica-
tion.

Each partial expression fills a rectangular box and has a logical vertical centre (LVC). Operators
glue text characters and boxes together in various ways. Simple numbers and variables occupy boxes
with the same width as their string representation naturally requires (four characters wide for 44.4, for
example) and are one character high. Since they are only one character high, their LVC is on the line
containing their text.

The unary minus operator followed by an expression E is one character wider than E. The LVC
will be the same as for E and the character - will appear to the left of E at the LVC.

The binary operators other than / and ^ join two expressions E1 and E2, with the result separating
the two expressions by three characters positions. The character for the operator will appear as the
middle character at the LVCs of the two expressions. This specifies their vertical alignment and the
new LVC.

The binary operator / joins two expressions E1 and E2. The result will be a vertical arrangement
of E1, a line of hyphens (-) and E2. The line will be as wide as the widest of the two expressions.
The skinnier one should be centered horizontally; if it cant be centered exactly it should be placed one
space to the right. The line forms the LVC of the result.

The binary operator ^ joins two expressions, a base and an exponent. The result will be the exponent
positioned above and to the right of the base with no extra space added. The results LVC will be in
line with the bases LVC.

The implicit grouping operator {} does not change the rendering or LVC of the expression that
it surrounds. The explicit one (()) is rendered by adding a column of (s to the left of the grouped
expression and another column of )s on the right. The resulting LVC will be halfway down; if this
cannot be done exactly then the LVC should be placed slightly further downwards.

There should be a blank line between each expression that is printed.

1/{1+1/{1+1/{1+x}}}
