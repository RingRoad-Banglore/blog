title: Uva 01417  Traffic Jam
---


## Input

```text

The kingdom of Tripbansai has an unusual traffic system. The city locations in the kingdom can be
described as a grid and all the roads connect neighboring cities. This rectangular grid has 2 rows and
C columns where every point represents a city. So there are 2  C cities and 3  C  2 roads in this
system.

Sometimes two adjacent cities become disconnected because of traffic jam, and sometimes the traffic
problem has been solved so that a road can be used again. We can assume that every road is closed at
first.

Ministry of Communications will give some instructions to you. Your task is to implement a program
as a traffic response information system.

Each instruction appears as a single line in one of the formats below:

Close r1 c1 r2 c2 Close the road connecting the adjacent cities located on (r1, c1) and (r2, c2).
Open r1 c1 r2 c2 Open the road connecting the adjacent cities located on (r1, c1) and (r2, c2).
Ask r1 c1 r2 c2 Reply with Y if there exists a way from the city on (r1, c1)

to the city on (r2, c2); reply with N if there doesnt.
Exit No more requests are forthcoming. The problem should exit.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains a single integer T (1  T  11), representing the number of test
cases that follow.

The first line of each test case consists of a single integer C (1  C  100000), which is the number
of columns.

There are some lines following, each for an instruction. Each test case ends with an instruction
Exit. There are no more than 100000 instructions in each test case. All the roads are closed initially,
and each case is an independent problem.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each instruction Ask r1 c1 r2 c2, display a line containing Y or N.
