In this problem, you will be given one or more integers in English. Your task is to translate these
numbers into their integer representation. The numbers can range from negative 999,999,999 to positive
999,999,999. The following is an exhaustive list of English words that your program must account for:

negative, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,
twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, hundred,
thousand, million

## Input

following requirements:

2. The word ‘hundred’ is not used when ‘thousand’ could be. For example, 1500 is written “one
thousand five hundred”, not “fifteen hundred”.

## Output

a newline after each.
