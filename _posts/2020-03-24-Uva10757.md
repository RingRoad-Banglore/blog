## Input

```
Your task is to write the part of the SQL server YourSQL responsible for processing queries.

Your server manages a relational database consisting of several tables. Each table has rows and
columns; each column has a fixed type (number or string) and a name. Each cell of the table also has
a type, which is equal to the type of its column. No two different columns of a table have the same
name. Tables also have distinct names.

Here is a sample table (the upper row contains column names; string cells are aligned to the left,
numeric to the right):

Account LastName FirstName Balance
1 Ivanov Petr 2500
2 Petrov Ivan 2000
3 Ivanov Ivan 3000

An SQL query is a string telling the server to get some or all of data from one or more tables, form
it up into a temporary table and transfer it to the client (after that, the temporary table is destroyed).
Here is the YourSQL query syntax:
query ::= SELECT select FROM from possible where possible order;
select ::= * | column list;
column list ::= name | name , column list;
from ::= name | inner  from INNER JOIN inner  from ON name = name;
inner  from ::= name | ( inner  from INNER JOIN inner  from ON name = name );
possible where ::= empty | WHERE where;
where ::= where 2 | where 2 (AND | OR) where;
where 2 ::= ( where ) | NOT where 2 | value operation value;
operation ::= = | < | > | <= | >= | <>;
value ::= number | string  constant | name;
possible order ::= empty | ORDER BY order  by;
order  by ::= order  column | order  column , order  by;
order  column ::= name (empty | ASCENDING | DESCENDING);
empty ::= ;
number ::= (empty | + | -) . unsigned;
unsigned ::= digit | digit . unsigned;
digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9;
name ::= letter | name . (letter | digit);
letter ::= a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t |
u | v | w | x | y | z | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P |
Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z;
string  constant ::= " . escaped string . ";
escaped string ::= empty | escaped symbol . escaped string;
escaped symbol ::= digit | letter | special  symbol | other  symbol;
special  symbol ::= \\ | \";
other symbol ::= ! | # | $ | % | & | ' | ( | ) |  | + | , | - | . | / | : | ; | < | = |
> | ? | @ | [ | ] | ^ | _ | ` | { | | | } | ~;

The period (.) between two subsequent terms means that there may be no spaces between these
terms. If there is no period between two terms, then they may be separated by any amount of spaces,

tab characters and carriage returns; two names that are not separated by a period will be separated by
at least one space, tab character or carriage return. Parenthesis are used to group terms. There is no
difference between uppercase and lowercase letters except in string constants.

The query is executed the following way:

 The search table is made from the FROM ... part of the query. If the FROM ... statement
contains only one name, then this name is the name of the search table. Otherwise the from
statement is from1 INNER JOIN from2 ON name1 = name2, where from1 and from2 are
from statements; tables table1 and table2 must be made from from1 and from2 respectively
before making the search table. In this case, name1 and name2 are the names of some columns
in table1 and table2 respectively; these two columns are of the same type. The list of the search
tables columns is the list of the table1 columns followed by the list of the table2 columns. (It is
guaranteed that no two columns in table1 and in table2 have the same names.) The search tables
rows are obtained in the following way. First, a row list (row 1 of table1 + row 1 of table2), (row
1 of table1 + row 2 of table2), , (row 2 of table1 + row 1 of table2) is made (here + means row
concatenation). Then the rows from the list which have the values of the columns name1 and
name2 equal are selected from this list to form the search table; the order of the rows remains
the same.

For example, if table1 is the table above and table2 is

From To Amount
1 2 1000
2 3 2000
3 1 3000
2 1 10

then the result of from1 INNER JOIN from2 ON Account = From will be

Account LastName FirstName Balance From To Amount
1 Ivanov Petr 2500 1 2 1000
2 Petrov Ivan 2000 2 3 2000
2 Petrov Ivan 2000 2 1 10
3 Ivanov Ivan 3000 3 1 3000

 The rows are selected from the search table to form the result table. If there is no WHERE clause, all
the rows are selected. Otherwise the rows that satisfy the WHERE clause are selected. Sequences
\\ and \" are treated as \ and " respectively in escaped strings. All logical and comparison
operations have their usual meaning; strings are compared lexicographically; compared values
will always be of same type. The operations are executed from left to right; i.e., a AND b OR c
means (a AND b) OR c. The names in the WHERE clause are the names of the columns of the table.

 The rows of the result table are ordered. If there is an ORDER BY clause, the rows are ordered by
the first column in the clause; the rows with equal first column value are ordered by the second
column etc. The strings are ordered lexicographically. The ASCENDING or DESCENDING word after
the column name represent the direction of the order: ASCENDING means that the smallest row
will be first and DESCENDING means that the smallest row will be last. The ASCENDING direction
is default. The sorting is stable, i.e., the order of equivalent rows remains the same.

 The columns which will be output will be selected. If an asterisk follows the SELECT word, then
all the columns are selected. Otherwise the list of the selected columns is given after the SELECT
word; the columns are outputted in the given order. (Note: the column list after the SELECT word
may contain the same column more than one time; in this case, the column is outputted each
time it appears in the list).
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains the number of the test cases, which is at most 35. The descriptions of
the test cases follow. The first line of a test case description contains a single integer K (1  K  20),
denoting the number of tables. The table descriptions follow. The first line of a table description is
the name of the table followed by two integers, M and N (1  M  10, 0  N  100000), which are
the number of columns and the number of rows respectivelty. Each of the next M lines contains the
name of a row and its type (S for string, I for numeric). Each of the next N lines contains M strings
or integers, being the table data. The i-th line contains data for row i. The strings and the numbers in
the input tables are separated by spaces; the strings are not escaped. The rest of the input file contains
the query.

The numbers in the input may not exceed 109 by absolute value and do not have leading zeroes;
the strings are of length no more than 100, the length of the names does not exceed 20. The overall
number of cells in all the input tables does not exceed 100000; the overall number of string cells in all
the input tables does not exceed 10000. There are no more than 10 INNER JOIN statements. In each
joining operation, the product of the number of rows in the first table and the number of rows in the
second table does not exceed 10000; the product of the previous number and the sum of the number of
columns of the two tables does not exceed 100000. The search table contains at most 100000 cells; at
most 10000 of them may be strings. If there is a WHERE clause, the search table has at most 1000 rows.
The length of the WHERE clause (excluding the word WHERE) does not exceed 400. There are at most
five columns in the ORDER BY clause. If the SELECT word is followed by a column list, then this list
contains at most 10 columns and the product of the amount of the columns in the list and the number
of rows in the result table does not exceed 10000.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case in the input, output the result table in the same format as the tables in the input
without the table name and type specifications (see sample output). Note that there is only one correct
order of the columns and the rows of the resulting table (see the rules above). Output the column
names in the same case that they were in the input. Output a blank line between test cases.
