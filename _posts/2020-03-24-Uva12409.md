## Input

```text
2011 was a crazy year. Many people all over the world proposed on 11-11-11, married on 11-11-11,
some even went through surgery only to have 11-11-11 as their childs birth date. How crazy people
can be! Dont they see there is a 20 hidden? Then what to do? A very elegant solution came from
ARR, a very famous and funny character  why do we need to follow Christian (or some calls it
Gregorian) calendar? Why dont we start our own calendar on the day of marriage? And those who
like to celebrate their marriage ceremony too frequent, why dont they declare only 1 day per year. In
that fashion they can celebrate their anniversary every day. And may be one minute a year or a second
or ... Uh.. getting complex. Lets back to the title. From now, we start to have a new calendar system,
Kisu Pari Na. And we hope to update this calendar on every national contest.

The purpose of this calendar is  we all will try our best to learn something
new in every year. For this first year lets learn some combinatory. It reminds me
of my first year in college. I faced this problem but could not solve this then. But
see how easy it is:

Say you start from upper left cell and want to go to lower right cell. The only
restriction is you can only move downward or rightward. How many ways are there?
How to solve it? Not that difficult. You have to go two times Down and three times Right (whichever
way you try) to reach the goal from the starting cell, right? So the answer is number of ways you
can arrange two D (represents Down) and three R (represent Right). 2 same characters and 3 same
characters, total 5 characters. So it is:

5!

2!3!
. Or

(D +R)!

D!R!
=D+R CR. Easy, isnt it?

Ok enough with learning. Now back to problem, given a grid and at each cell there are some coins.
Inky and Pinky are playing a game getting inspiration from the above problem. At each turn, a player
chooses a non empty cell and then removes one or more coins from that cell and put them to the cell
exactly right of it or exactly beneath it. A player cant divide the coins and put one part to right and
others to down. Note that, for the cells at the right column the player cant move it to more right,
and same for the bottom-most row. So a player cant move coins from the lower right cell. The game
will finish when no moves are available and the player who moved last will win. Now inky being very
modest asked Pinky to move first. Can you say if Pinky will win if both play perfectly?

## Output

```text
Input starts with an integer T ( 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing two integers R C (1  R  C  50000), where R denotes
the number of rows and C denotes the number of columns of the grid respectively. Each of the next R
lines contains C space separated integers denoting the grid. These integers lie in the range [0, 109].

```

## Sample Input

```text
For every test case, output case number followed by win if Pinky can win or lose.
