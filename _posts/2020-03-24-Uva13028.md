title: Uva 13028  XOR Subset

## Input

```
Fermats little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number (apa)
is an integer multiple of p. In the notation of modular arithmetic, this is expressed as

ap  a(mod p)

For example, if a = 2 and p = 7, 27 = 128, and 128 2 = 7 18 is an integer multiple of 7. We can
also write 128%7 = 2, here % is the modulo operator used in C/C++ or Java.

If a is not divisible by p, Fermats little theorem is equivalent to the statement that ap1  1 is an
integer multiple of p, or in symbols

ap1  1(mod p)

For example, if a = 2 and p = 7 then 26 = 64 and 64 1 = 63 is a multiple of 7. We can also write
64%7 = 1.

You are given a set S which contains 1 to N . You want to find two subsets of S, X and Y such
that the following conditions are met:

1. X  Y = 

2. Let bitwise XOR of every element of X equals U and Y equals V . U must be less than or equal
to V .

You want to find out number of ways you can choose such subset X and Y .
Two ways (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) will be equal if X1 equals X2 and Y1 equals Y2 or X1 equals Y2 and

Y1 equals X2.

For example is S = {1, 2}, the ways are:

1. X = , Y = . [U = 0, V = 0]

2. X = , Y = {1}. [U = 0, V = 1]

3. X = , Y = {1, 2}. [U = 0, V = 1  2 = 3, ( means bitwise XOR in C/C++/Java)]

4. X = , Y = {2}. [U = 0, V = 2]

5. X = {1}, Y = {2}. [U = 1, V = 2]

Now, given N , you need to find the number of ways you can choose two subsets of S such that the
2 conditions meet, modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

## Output

```
First line contains T (T  100), the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines each contains an
integer N (0  N < 1010000).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case print one line, Case C: W , where C is the case number, and W is the required answer
for that case.
