Joe Six-Pack

The gym at the University of Alberta
has two identical sit up benches that
are side by side. Each of these benches
can be inclined in 10 degree incre-
ments between 10 degrees and 50 de-
grees inclusive depending on the level
of difficulty the user desires. At the
end of each day the gym staff adjust
the incline of each machine to be 10
degrees. This means at the start of
each day both machines have a 10 de-
gree incline.

Every time someone uses a bench
it incurs some wear and tear that
amounts to 15 cents in maintenance
costs. Additionally, every time a
bench has its incline changed it in-
curs wear and tear that amounts to the
number of degrees the bench was ad-
justed, in cents. For example, if some-
one moves the bench from a 40 degree incline to a 20 degree incline then 20 cents of maintenance must
be done.

The gym staff have recently required students to sign up for the situp benches the day before. When
a student signs up they give the time at which they would like to use the machine and the incline they
will use it at. No more than two students can sign up to use a bench at the same time.

Prior to opening the gym for the day, the gym staff would like to have a list assigning students to
each of the situp benches and they would like the assignment to minimize the total maintenance cost
for the day. They have asked you to write a program to make this list.

## Output

```text
Input begins with the number of test cases on its own line. Each test case begins with the number n
(1  n  10000), the number of students who have signed up to use the benches on the following day.
Following are n lines, each consisting of two numbers: time_slot and incline. time_slot is a number
that specifies when a student will arrive at the machine, while incline specifies the angle to which they
will adjust the situp bench. Two students in the same time_slot arrive at the benches at the same
time, and lower time_slots occur before higher time_slots. time_slots are numbered between 0 and
20000, and incline is one of 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 depending on the students preference.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a line containing the total maintenance cost (in cents) for the day followed
by n lines (one for each student, in the order given on input) containing either a 1 or a 2 depending
on which bench you have assigned them to. Any assignment that minimizes the total maintenance cost
for the day is acceptable.
