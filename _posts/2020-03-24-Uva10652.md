title: Uva 10652  Board Wrapping
---


```
The small sawmill in Mission, British Columbia, has devel-
oped a brand new way of packaging boards for drying. By
fixating the boards in special moulds, the board can dry
efficiently in a drying room.

Space is an issue though. The boards cannot be too
close, because then the drying will be too slow. On the
other hand, one wants to use the drying room efficiently.

Looking at it from a 2-D perspective, your task is to
calculate the fraction between the space occupied by the
boards to the total space occupied by the mould. Now, the
mould is surrounded by an aluminium frame of negligible
thickness, following the hull of the boards corners tightly.
The space occupied by the mould would thus be the interior
of the frame.

## Input

```
On the first line of input there is one integer, N  50, giving
the number of test cases (moulds) in the input. After this line, N test cases follow. Each test case
starts with a line containing one integer n, 1 < n  600, which is the number of boards in the mould.
Then n lines follow, each with five floating point numbers x, y, w, h,  where 0  x, y, w, h  10000
and 90 <   90. The x and y are the coordinates of the center of the board and w and h are the
width and height of the board, respectively.  is the angle between the height axis of the board to the
y-axis in degrees, positive clockwise. That is, if  = 0, the projection of the board on the x-axis would
be w. Of course, the boards cannot intersect.

```

## Output

```
For every test case, output one line containing the fraction of the space occupied by the boards to the
total space in percent. Your output should have one decimal digit and be followed by a space and a
percent sign (%).
