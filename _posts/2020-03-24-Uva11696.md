```
In ancient times, communication was not as swift as
it is today. When a kingdom was at war, it could
take months to muster all the armed forces. But by
using fire-lit beacons at strategic locations, it was still
possible to quickly send emergency signals.

When the first beacon is lit, all other beacons
within sight from it are also lit. All beacons within
sight of these are then lit, and so on until all beacons are lit  assuming of course that all beacons
are within sight of each other, directly or indirectly. If they are not, the dire news must be carried by
riders between some beacons.

Given the location of all beacons in the kingdom as well as the location and size of all mountain
peaks, write a program that determines how many messages must be sent by riders in order for all
beacons to be lit when an enemy threatens the country.

For simplicity, we model the country in the following way: a beacon is represented as a point in the
xy-plane and a mountain peak is represented as a circle. Two beacons are considered to be within sight
of each other if no mountain peak blocks the straight line between the two beacons.

The input will be constructed so that the straight line between any pair of beacons will not touch
the circumference of a mountain peak, unless it passes through the interior of another mountain peak.
Mountain peaks will not overlap or touch, nor will any beacon be on a mountain peak or on its
circumference.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N < 25) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

The first line of input for each test case contains two integers n (1  n  1000) and m (0  m  1000)
the number of beacons and the number of mountain peaks, respectively. Then follow n lines specifying
the locations of the beacons. The location of each beacon is given as a pair of integers x and y
(0  x, y  10000). Then follow m lines describing the mountain peaks. Each mountain peak is given
as a pair of integers x and y (0  x, y  10000) specifying the location of the peak and a radius r
(1  r  5000).

```

## Output

```
For each test case the output should be a line containing a single integer: the number of messages that
must be carried by riders for all beacons to be lit.
