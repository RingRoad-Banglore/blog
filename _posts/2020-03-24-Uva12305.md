title: Uva 12305  Polishing a Extruded Polygon
---


## Input

```
You have a simple polygon on z = 0 plane, then you make an extrusion so that its height becomes h
unit (i.e. the top surface is now on z = h). We call the extruded polygon the model. Note that the
model is a solid.

After that, you apply m cutting operations on the model. Each operation is described by four
integers a, b, c, d, that is to remove the set of points (xp, yp, zp) satisfying axp + byp + czp + d > 0.
Finally, you need to calculate the volume and surface area of the polished model.
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 10 test cases. Each case begins with three integers n, h, m (1  n  1000,
1  h  10, 1  m  100), the number of vertices of the polygon, the height after the extrusion, and
the number of operations. The next n lines contain the vertices of the polygon in counter-clockwise
order (note that theyre in z = 0 plane, so the z coordinates are not given. Coordinates are real numbers
whose absolute values are not greater than 1000). Each of the next m lines contains four real numbers
a, b, c, d, describing one operation. At least one of a, b, c is non-zero. The last test case is followed by
a line with n = h = m = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the volume and surface area of the original model and polished model after
every operation (i.e. output m+1 lines in total). Each number should be rounded to three digits after
the decimal point. It is guaranteed that the volume and surface area is always strictly positive. To
reduce the impact of floating-point errors, each number you print could differ from the standard output
by up to 0.005.
