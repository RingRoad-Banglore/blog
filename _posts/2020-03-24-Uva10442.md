## Input

```
The programming language Ada has integer constants that
look like this: 123, 8#123#, 16#abc#. These constants
represent the integers 123, 83 (123 base 8) and 2739 (abc
base 16). More precisely, an integer may be a decimal inte-
ger given as a sequence of one or more digits less than 10,
or it may be an integer to some specific base, given as the
base followed by a sequence of one or more digits less than
the base enclosed by # symbols. Lower case letters from a
through f are used as the digits representing 10 through 15.

In Ada, the base, if specified, must be a sequence of
decimal digits. For this problem, however, the base may
be of any form described above so long as it represents an
integer between 2 and 16 inclusive.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input contains a positive integer n. n lines
follow.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input, output a line yes if it is a valid integer constant according to the above
rules; otherwise output a line containing no. Input lines contain no spaces and are between 1 and 80
characters in length.

```
