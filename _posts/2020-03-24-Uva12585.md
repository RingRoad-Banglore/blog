## Input

```

Alice and Bob loves playing poker with their friends. Unfortunately, they play poker way better than
their friends. So, almost always they are the last two players to play. Two of them can play for a long
time and it bores their friends. So they changed the rule little bit and decided that both of them will
go all in every round. Now, Alice is wondering what is the expected length of the game, and what is
the probability that she will win the game.

Lets say at the beginning of round i, Alice has ai Taka (Currency of Bangladesh) and Bob has bi
Taka. and ci is the minimum of ai and bi. Alice and Bob are equally likely to win the round. If Alice
wins, she gets ci Taka from Bob, otherwise Bob gets ci Taka from her. Game ends when one of them
has 0 (Zero) Taka and obviously the person with 0 taka loses.

Given that the initial amount Alice has is a0 and the initial amount that Bob has is b0, you have to
find the probability that Alice is going to win and expected number of rounds the game is played.
