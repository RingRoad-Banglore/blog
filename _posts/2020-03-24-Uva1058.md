## Input

```text
You are the chief designer of a road race that will be held in a hilly area. The racecourse consists of N
connected straight line segments; that is, the end of the kth segment coincides with the beginning of the
(k + 1)st segment. During planning, these segments are laid out on a planar surface, so 2-dimensional
Cartesian coordinates identify the endpoints. The first segment begins at the origin. Figure 1 shows
the planar view of a racecourse with 6 segments.

Figure 1

The actual race is run on the side of a
hill. For simplicity, assume the hill makes
an angle  with the horizontal plane, as
illustrated in Figure 2.

The plane of the hill and the hor-
izontal plane intersect in the y-axis.
Each 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate
(xi, yi) corresponds to a 3-dimensional
form (xi, y


i, z


i), with z


i representing the

height of the endpoint of the ith linear
segment. The height of the origin is 0.

This particular race is intended for
novice drivers, so the racecourse must not

include any segments that require downhill travel. That is, if the height of the endpoint of segment k is
z

k, then the height of the endpoint of each segment after segment k must not be less than z


k. Formally

we can write zk  z

m, for m  k.

Figure 2

If a proposed racecourse includes
downhill segments, it might be possible
to transform it into a racecourse with no
downhill segments by rotating the planar
view of the entire course about the ori-
gin, without changing the angle between
consecutive pairs of segments. However
there may be proposed racecourses that
cannot be made acceptable by such a ro-
tation.

In this problem you must determine if
a proposed racecourse is acceptable (that
is, if it does not contain any downhill seg-
ments). If it is not acceptable, you must
determine the minimum angle through
which the racecourse must be rotated to
make it acceptable, if that is possible.

## Output

```text
The input consists of multiple test cases.
Each test case is a description of a proposed racecourse and the slope of the hillside on which it will be
run. The first line of each description contains two integers N (1  N  10000) and (0o    45o). N
denotes the number of segments in the course and  denotes the angle (in degrees) that the hillside makes

with the horizontal plane. Each of the next N lines contains a pair of integers (xi, yi), (1  i  N),
which are the endpoints of the linear segments comprising the racecourse. The first segment begins at
the origin, and segment k + 1 begins at the endpoint of segment k. No segment has zero length.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeroes.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a line containing the test case number (beginning with 1). If the proposed
course is acceptable without rotation, print Acceptable as proposed. If the course is not acceptable
as proposed, but can be made acceptable by rotating it about the origin, print Acceptable after
clockwise rotation of X degrees or Acceptable after counterclockwise rotation of X
degrees. The value X should be an unsigned number. For our purposes, a clockwise rotation would
rotate the positive y-axis toward the positive x-axis. If both a clockwise and a counterclockwise rotation
can make the course acceptable, choose the one with the smaller angle. If both rotations have the same
angle, then choose the clockwise rotation. If the course cannot be made acceptable by any rotation,
print Unacceptable. Display the angles of rotation rounded to two fractional digits.

Print a blank line after the output for each test case. Use an output format similar to that shown
in the sample output below.
