## Input

```
A positive integer number is Special if it is both a square (eg. 1, 4, 9, 16, 64 ...) and a cube (eg.
1, 8, 27, 64 ...). The smallest special number is 1. Now your job is to write a program that finds
whether a number less than 100000000 is special or not. It may be noted that there are only 21 such
numbers within this range and these are 1, 64, 729, 4096, 15625, 46656, 117649, 262144, 531441,
1000000, 1771561, 2985984, 4826809, 7529536, 11390625, 16777216, 24137569, 34012224,
47045881, 64000000 and 85766121.

A very childish but legitimate C/C++ solution, which would work for positive numbers not exceed-
ing 15624, is shown below.
```

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 1001 lines of input. Each line contains a positive integer less than
100000000. Input is terminated by a line containing a zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. This line contains a string (without
the quotes) Special if the number is special and Ordinary if the number is not special. Look at the
output for the sample input for details.
