title: Uva 12633  Super Rooks on a Chessboard
---


```
Lets assume there is a new chess piece named Super-rook. When placed at a cell of a chessboard, it
attacks all the cells that belong to the same row or same column. Additionally it attacks all the
cells of the diagonal that goes from top-left to bottom-right direction through that cell.

N Super-rooks are placed on a R  C chessboard. The rows are numbered 1 to R from top to
bottom and columns are numbered 1 to C from left to right of the chessboard. You have to find the
number of cells of the chessboard which are not attacked by any of the Super-rooks.

The picture on the left shows the attacked cells when a Super-rook is placed at cell (5, 3) of a 6 6
chessboard. And the picture on the right shows the attacked cells when three Super-rooks are placed
at cells (3, 4), (5, 3) and (5, 6). These pictures (Left and right one) corresponds to the first and second
sample input respectively.
```

## Input

```
First line of input contains an integer T (1  T  20) which is the number of test cases. The first
line of each test case contains three integers R, C and N (1  R,C,N  50, 000). The next N lines
contain two integers r, c giving the row and column of a Super-rook on the chessboard (1  r  R and
1  c  C). You may assume that two Super-rooks wont be placed on the same cell.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the case number followed by the number of cells which are not attacked by
any of the Super-rook.
