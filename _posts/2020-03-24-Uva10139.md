```
The factorial function, n! is defined thus for n a non-negative integer:

0! = 1

n! = n (n 1)! (n > 0)

We say that a divides b if there exists an integer k such that

k  a = b
```

## Input

```
The input to your program consists of several lines, each containing two non-negative integers, n and
m, both less than 231.

```

## Output

```
For each input line, output a line stating whether or not m divides n!, in the format shown below.

```

## Sample Input

```
6 9
6 27
20 10000
20 100000
1000 1009

```

## Sample Output

```
9 divides 6!
27 does not divide 6!
10000 divides 20!
100000 does not divide 20!
1009 does not divide 1000!
```
