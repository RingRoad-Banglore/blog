title: Uva 10537  The Toll! Revisited
---


## Input

```text
Sindbad the Sailor sold 66 silver spoons to the Sultan of Samarkand. The selling was quite easy; but
delivering was complicated. The items were transported over land, passing through several towns and
villages. Each town and village demanded an entry toll. There were no tolls for leaving. The toll for
entering a village was simply one item. The toll for entering a town was one piece per 20 items carried.
For example, to enter a town carrying 70 items, you had to pay 4 items as toll. The towns and villages
were situated strategically between rocks, swamps and rivers, so you could not avoid them.

Figure 1: To reach Samarkand with 66 spoons, traveling through a town followed by two villages, you
must start with 76 spoons.

Figure 2: The best route to reach X with 39 spoons, starting from A, is AbcX, shown with
arrows in the figure on the left. The best route to reach X with 10 spoons is ADX, shown in the

figure on the right. The figures display towns as squares and villages as circles.

Predicting the tolls charged in each village or town is quite simple, but finding the best route (the
cheapest route) is a real challenge. The best route depends upon the number of items carried. For
numbers up to 20, villages and towns charge the same. For large numbers of items, it makes sense to
avoid towns and travel through more villages, as illustrated in Figure 2.

You must write a program to solve Sindbads problem. Given the number of items to be delivered
to a certain town or village and a road map, your program must determine the total number of items
required at the beginning of the journey that uses a cheapest route. You will also have to find the
cheapest route. If there is more than one such route, print the lexicographically smallest one (A-n-d is
smaller than a-n-d).

## Output

```text
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the roadmap followed by
the delivery details.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 10537  The Toll! Revisited 2/2

The first line of the roadmap contains an integer n, which is the number of roads in the map
(0  n). Each of the next n lines contains exactly two letters representing the two endpoints of a road.
A capital letter represents a town; a lower case letter represents a village. Roads can be traveled in
either direction.

Following the roadmap is a single line for the delivery details. This line consists of three things:
an integer p (0 < p < 1000000000) for the number of items that must be delivered, a letter for the
starting place, and a letter for the place of delivery. The roadmap is always such that the items can be
delivered.

The last test case is followed by a line containing the number -1.

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of three lines for each test case. First line displays the case number, second line
shows the number of items required at the beginning of the journey and third line shows the path
according to the problem statement above. Actually, the path contains all the city/village names that
Sindbad sees along his journey. Two consecutive city/village names in the path are separated by a
hyphen.
