title: Uva 12826  Incomplete Chessboard
---


## Input

```

In chess, King is the most important piece. It can move left, right, up, down or diagonally, but only
one square at a time, shown below.

Given two squares A(r1, c1), B(r2, c2), your task is to calculate the number of moves needed to move
a king from A to B. To make the problem (slightly) harder, one square C(r3, c3) is removed from the
chessboard, that means the king should never go into square C during his trip. In this problem, rows
are numbered 1..8 from bottom to top, and columns are numbered 1..8 from left to right.
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 10000 test cases. Each case contains 6 integers r1, c1, r2, c2, r3, c3 (1 
r1, c1, r2, c2, r3, c3  8). Three squares A, B, C are always distinct.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the minimum number of moves needed.

```

## Sample Output

```
1 1 8 7 5 6

1 1 3 3 2 2

```
