title: Uva 10588  Queuing at the doctors

## Input

```text
Due to the increasing number of weird viruses
spreading around, all the members of the In-
ternational Confederation of Revolver Enthusi-
asts (ICORE) are required by their boss to do
quarterly physical checkups at General Hospi-
tal. All checkups are arranged by the boss and
scheduled on the same day. Each member of
ICORE gets instructions where they are given

 their number from the set {1 . . . n}

 the time of the day when they are supposed to show up at General Hospital

 a list of doctors offices that they are to visit in the listed order.

Doctors offices in General Hospital are numbered with numbers from the set {1 . . .m}.
All the members of ICORE have been convinced that the schedule of the checkups has been pro-

fessionally prepared and that there would be no lining up and waiting at the doctors doors. However,
since their boss was a political appointment their hopes for not wasting time had to be abandoned as
soon as they started arriving at the hospital. The queues were forming rapidly despite the fact that the
doctors were very efficient due to their usual sloppiness. The members of ICORE are all very disciplined
and obey the following rules for visiting the doctors

 if an ICORE member was supposed to show up at the hospital at time t, then at time t they show
up at the first doctors office on their list;

 if several people show up a doctors office at time t then they form a queue in increasing order of
their numbers and join the end of the queue already formed by people who arrived earlier;

 if at time t in front of office x there is a queue of people who arrived earlier or at time t, then
the first person from the queue enters office x. This person after a time unit (the doctors do a
sloppy job, remember) exits the office and at time t+ 1 appears at the next office from their list
of offices to visit. At that time the first person from the queue enters office x;

 if a visit at office x at time t was for the given visitor the last visit on their list, then at time t+1
this visitor leaves the hospital.

Your task is to find the time when the last visitor leaves the hospital.

```text
The first line of input contains a natural number c giving the number of cases to handle. The following

case contains two natural numbers n and m, 1  n,m  1000, giving the number of the visitors and
the number of doctors offices for the case. Each of the following n lines contains a sequence of natural
numbers. Among these lines, line i (1  i  n) has the following format
