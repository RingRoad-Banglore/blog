## Input

```
Write a program, that, given a board, and a list of rectangular sub-portions of the board, returns the
number of positions that belong to no sub-portion.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of a series of test sets separated by blank lines. A test set starts with a line with
three numbers W , H and N , giving respectively the width, the height and the number of sub-boards.
These values satisfy the following constraints: 1  W,H  500 and 0  N  99. Follow then N
lines, composed of four integers X1, Y1, X2, Y2, such that (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are the positions of two
opposite corners of a sub-board. These values satisfy the following constraints: 1  X1, X2  W and
1  Y1, Y2  H. The end of the input is reached when the numbers W , H and N are equal to 0.

This last line shall not be considered as a test set.

```

## Sample Input

```
The program shall output each result on a line by its own, following the format given in the sample
output.
