11070 The good old times
In the stoneage things weren’t as easy for programmers as they are today. For example programmers had
only very slow computers with a very limited main memory and very small hard disks at their disposal.
Furthermore a lot of standard applications hadn’t been developed. Now one of your customers, Fred
Flintstone, wants a command line calculator for his computer, the new Granite500 with 1000 hertz.
Your task is to write a command line calculator for him.

## Input
Each line of input will consist of a string of length l, l < 255, containing a valid arithmetic expression.
Because main memory was very small in those days, the string will contain no blanks or tabs, nor
parathensis. It will contain the four standard arithmetic operators ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’,/ as well as a unary ‘-’
or ‘+’ and floating point numbers. The input will be terminated by EOF.

## Output
For each line of input, output the value of the arithmetic expression on a single line. The result should
contain three digits after the decimal point.

Hint: use double

## Sample Input
<p>1/2/2</p><p>-3.0</p><p>3</p><p>4.0+3.0/5.0</p><p>1*2*3+1+1*2+1*2*3*4</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>0.250</p><p>-3.000</p><p>3.000</p><p>4.600</p><p>33.000</p>
