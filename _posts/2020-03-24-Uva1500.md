title: Uva 01500  Alice and Bob
---


```

Alice and Bob are very smart guys and they like to play all kinds of games in their spare time. the
most amazing thing is that they always find the best strategy, and thats why they feel bored again
and again. They just invented a new game, as they usually did.

The rule of the new game is quite simple. At the beginning of the game, they write down N random
positive integers, then they take turns (Alice first) to either:

1. Decrease a number by one.

2. Erase any two numbers and write down their sum.

Whenever a number is decreased to 0, it will be erased automatically. the game ends when all
numbers are finally erased, and the one who cannot play in his(her) turn loses the game.

Heres the problem: Who will win the game if both use the best strategy? Find it out quickly,
before they get bored of the game again!
