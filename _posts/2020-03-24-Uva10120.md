## Input

```
There is a beautiful river in a small village. N rocks are arranged in a straight line numbered 1 to N
from left bank to the right bank, as shown below.

[LeftBank] [Rock1] [Rock2] [Rock3] [Rock4] . . . [RockN ] [RightBank]

The distance between two adjacent rocks is exactly 1 meter, while the distance between the left bank
and rock 1 and the distance between Rock N and the right bank are also 1 meter.

Frog Frank was about to cross the river, his neighbor Frog Funny came to him and said,

Hello, Frank. Happy Childrens Day! I have a gift for you. See it? A little parcel on Rock 5.
Oh, thats great! Thank you! Ill get it.
Wait...This present is for smart frogs only. You cant get it by jumping to it directly.
Oh? Then what should I do?
Jump more times. Your first jump must be from the left bank to Rock 1, then, jump as many

times as you like - no matter forward or backward, but your i-th jump must cover 2  i  1 meters.
Whats more, once you return to the left bank or reach the right bank, the game ends, and no more
jumps are allowed.

Hmmm, not easy... let me have a think! Answered Frog Frank, Should I give it a try?
```

## Output

```
The input will contain no more than 2000 test cases. Each test case contains a single line. It contains
two positive integers N (2  N  106), and M (2  M  N), M indicates the number of the rock on
which the gift is located. A test case in which N = 0, M = 0 will terminate the input and should not
be regarded as a test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a single line containing Let me try! If its possible to get to Rock m,
otherwise, output a single line containing Don't make fun of me!

Note: In test case 2, Frank can reach the gift in this way:

Forward(torock4), Forward(torock9), Backward(torock2, gotthegift!)

Note that if Frank jumps forward in his last jump, he will land on the right bank (assume that
banks are large enough) and thus, lost the game.
