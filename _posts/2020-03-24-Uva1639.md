```

LazyChild is a lazy child who likes candy very much. Despite being very young, he has two large candy
boxes, each contains n candies initially. Everyday he chooses one box and open it. He chooses the first
box with probability p and the second box with probability (1  p). For the chosen box, if there are
still candies in it, he eats one of them; otherwise, he will be sad and then open the other box.

He has been eating one candy a day for several days. But one day, when opening a box, he finds no
candy left. Before opening the other box, he wants to know the expected number of candies left in the
other box. Can you help him?
