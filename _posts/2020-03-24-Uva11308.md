Wolfgang Puck has an extensive collection of cake recipes. They are
separated into different binders depending on the type of cake. Al-
though Wolfgang has restaurant franchises all over the world, he is in
a period of hard times and is struggling to afford ingredients for his
cakes. What cakes can he create with his small budget?
```

## Input

```
On the first line you are given t (1  t  100), the number of binders.
Each binder begins with title, the name of the binder, then on the next
line m n b (1  m,n  100, 1  b  106) where b is Wolfgangs budget
in dollars. The next m lines are given as ingredient c (see sample input) where c (0  c  5000) is
the price in dollars for one unit of ingredient.

Then follow n recipes. Each recipe begins with name on a line of its own, then on the very next
line k (1  k  100). The following k lines are of the form requirement x (see sample input) where
x is the number of units of the ingredient requirement used in the recipe name.

```

## Output

```
For each binder, output the name of the binder in uppercase letters then on separate lines a list of recipes
within Wolfgangs budget in increasing order of cost. If no such recipe exists, print Too expensive!.
If recipes have the same cost print them in lexicographical order. Print a blank line after each binder.
