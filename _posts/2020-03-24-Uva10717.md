title: Uva 10717  Mint
---


## Input

```text
The Royal Canadian Mint has commissioned a new series of
designer coffee tables, with legs that are constructed from
stacks of coins. Each table has four legs, each of which
uses a different type of coin. For example, one leg might
be a stack of quarters, another nickels, another loonies, and
another twonies. Each leg must be exactly the same length.

Many coins are available for these tables, including for-
eign and special commemorative coins. Given an inventory
of available coins and a desired table height, compute the
lengths nearest to the desired height for which four legs of
equal length may be constructed using a different coin for
each leg.
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. Each case begins with
an integers: 4  n  50 giving the number of types of coins
available, and 1  t  10 giving the number of tables to
be designed. n lines follow; each gives the thickness of a
coin in hundredths of millimetres. t lines follow; each gives
the height of a table to be designed (also in hundredths of
millimetres). A line containing 0 0 follows the last test
case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each table, output a line with two integers: the greatest leg length not exceeding the desired length,
and the smallest leg length not less than the desired length.
