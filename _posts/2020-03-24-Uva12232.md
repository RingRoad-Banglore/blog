## Input

```
You are not given n non-negative integers X0, X1, . . . , Xn1 less than 220, but they do exist, and their
values never change.

Ill gradually provide you some facts about them, and ask you some questions.
There are two kinds of facts, plus one kind of question:

Format Meaning
I p v I tell you Xp = v
I p q v I tell you Xp XOR Xq = v
Q k p1 p2 . . . pk Please tell me the value of Xp1 XOR Xp2 XOR . . .XOR Xpk
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 10 test cases. Each case begins with two integers n and Q (1  n  20, 000, 2 
Q  40, 000). Each of the following lines contains either a fact or a question, formatted as stated above.
The k parameter in the questions will be a positive integer not greater than 15, and the v parameter
in the facts will be a non-negative integer less than 220. The last case is followed by n = Q = 0, which
should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number on its own line, then the answers, one on each one. If you
cant deduce the answer for a particular question, from the facts I provide you before that question,
print I don't know., without quotes. If the i-th fact (dont count questions) cannot be consistent
with all the facts before that, print The first i facts are conflicting., then keep silence for
everything after that (including facts and questions).

Print a blank line after the output of each test case.

```
