title: Uva 12074  The Ultimate Bamboo Eater
---


```
Jingjing the panda lives in a forest containing n pieces of bam-
boo land. Each bamboo land is very small and can be regarded
as a single point. Bamboo land i contains Li bamboos and is
associated with a deliciousness Wi.

Jingjing eats all bamboos in a selected bamboo land every
day. He has a bad habit: the deliciousness of the bamboo land
he selects must be strictly larger than that of the day before.

Moving from one land to another is very tiring. The longer
Jingjing walks before arriving a bamboo land i, the more bamboo
he is expecting. If the distance he walked from the last bamboo
land is strictly larger than the number of bamboos he finds in the
current land (i.e Li), he will die of sadness.

Distance of two points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) equals to |x0 
x1| + |y0  y1|, since Jingjing only moves north, south, east and
west.

When you send Jingjing in one bamboo land someday, how
many days can Jingjing survive (Jingjing is clever enough to find
out the optimal way of living)?

We need this information so that we can bring him out before
he dies.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains a single integer t (1  t  10), the number of test cases. Each test case contains
several lines.

The first line contains a single integer n (1  n  100, 000), the number of bamboo lands. The
next n lines each contains 4 integers Xi, Yi, Wi, Li, indicating the coordinate of i-th bamboo land, its
deliciousness and number of bamboos.

You may assume that 0  Xi, Yi,Wi, Li  1, 000, 000. No two lands have the same deliciousness.
Two bamboo lands can be so close that they can be regarded as at the same point.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number followed by the number of days Jingjing can survive. Look
at the output for sample input for details.
