## Input

```text
A certain frazzled programmer is writing a program that receives two numbers at a time in hexadecimal
form, performs an addition or subtraction on them, and outputs the result in decimal form. However,
the binary representation of the hexadecimal numbers also needs to be output, in the exact format
shown by the sample output below.

This programmer would gladly write the routine to do this himself, but every time he tries to do
anything in base 2, he breaks out in hives. So if you write this little routine for him, he would be
eternally grateful.

You may assume the following:

 The largest allowable hexadecimal number is FFF.

 When subtracting, the second number will always be smaller than the first, i.e. no negative
results.

 The spacing in the input file will be uniform throughout, i.e. no spaces at the beginning of a line,
and one space between each element.
```

## Output

```text
The input for this program will come from a file. The format for the file is as follows:
N (This is the number of expressions to compute)
HEX1 (+ or -) HEX2 (The first expression)
.
.
.
HEX1 (+ or -) HEX2 (The nth expression)

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output file should be in the following format:
BINARY 1 (+ or -) BINARY 2 = DECIMAL (first result)
.
.
.
BINARY 1 (+ or -) BINARY 2 = DECIMAL (nth result)

```

## Sample Output

```text
2
A + 3
AAA + BBB

```
