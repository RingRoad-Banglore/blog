title: Uva 01723  Intervals
---


```
You are given n closed, integer intervals [ai, bi] and n integers c1, . . . , cn.

Write a program that:

 reads the number of intervals, their endpoints and integers c1, . . . , cn from the standard input,

 computes the minimal size of a set Z of integers which has at least ci common elements with
interval [ai, bi], for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

 writes the answer to the standard output.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input cointains an integer indicating the number of datasets. Its followed by a
blank line.

The first line of each dataset contains an integer n (1  n  50000)  the number of intervals.
The following n lines describe the intervals. The line i+1 of the input contains three integers ai, bi, ci
separated by single spaces and such that 0  ai  bi  50000 and 1  ci  bi  ai + 1.

There is a blank line between datasets.

```

## Output

```
The output for each dataset contains exactly one integer equal to the minimal size of a set Z sharing
at least ci elements with interval [ai, bi], for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

Print a blank line between datasets.
