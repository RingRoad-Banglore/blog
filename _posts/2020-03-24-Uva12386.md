title: Uva 12386  Smallest Polygon
---


```
Given 3  n  10 distinct points (x, y) with integer coordinates, Mohammad wants to find a polygon
with minimum area which has these points as its vertices. However, he would have liked to minimize
the polygon perimeter as well. He is curious to know how long on perimeter he is compromising to get
the smallest-area polygon.
```

## Input

```
An integer T as the number of test-cases is given on the first line. Each test-case consists of an integer
n, on a single line, as the number of points. For the following n lines, x and y coordinates of the points
are given as two integers (0  x, y  100).

```

## Output

```
Print on a single line per test-case, the difference between the perimeters of the minimum-area polygon
and the minimum-perimeter polygon. Round the results to 4 decimal places.
