title: Uva 11027  Palindromic Permutation
---


## Input

```
Given a string of characters, we can permute the individual characters to make new strings. We can
then order these strings into alphabetical order.

For example the string abba gives rise to the following 6 distinct permutations in alphabetical
order.

aabb 1
abab 2
abba 3
baab 4
baba 5
bbaa 6

Of these 6 permutations, only 2 are palindromes (A string that reads the same when read backwards).
These are abba and baab.

Given a string, you have to find out the nth palindrome in the sorted list of all permutations. For
the above case abba is the 1-st and baab is the 2-nd palindrome.
```

## Output

```
The first line of input gives the number of test cases. Each case contains a string, consisting of lowercase
letters only, followed by a space separated positive integer n (n < 231). The length of the string will be
at most 30.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, output the case number followed by the nth palindrome, but if the total number of
palindromes is less than n output XXX without the quotes. Follow the sample for exact format.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
abba 1
abba 2
abba 3

```
