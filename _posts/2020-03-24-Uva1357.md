## Input

```

Scientists are conducting research on the behavior of a newly discovered Agamic Cellular Microbe. This
special kind of microbe is capable of massively reproducing by itself in a short time. The lifetime of an
ACM consists of three phases:

1. The infancy phase, which starts from its birth and lasts for approximately several seconds;

2. The multiplication phase, in which one ACM can procreate up to 100 offspring in only several
milliseconds;

3. The mature phase, in which it remains inactive for the rest of its life.

At the beginning of the experiment, a newborn, single cell of ACM, is put into a suitable cir-
cumstance for its production. This cell, numbered as 0, starts to multiply and its descendants are
numbered, starting from 1, according to their positions in the family hierarchy. During the experiment
special equipment is used to record the numbers of the offspring generated by each of the ACMs. The
experiment is stopped after a certain time period.

The family tree of ACMs in the first case of sample input

Your task is to help the scientists to determine whether one ACM is an ancestor of another.

## Output

```
Standard input will contain multiple test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T (1 
T  10) which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow, each preceded by a single blank line.

Each test case starts with a single integer N (1  N  300, 000) which is the number of ACMs
that have their descendants recorded. The following N integers (not necessarily on a same line), Ci
(0  i < N, 0  Ci  100), give the number of offspring of the i-th ACM. The next line contains an
integer M (1  M  1, 000, 000) which is the number of queries. M lines follow, each contains two
integers a and b, querying whether the a-th ACM is an ancestor of the b-th ACM.

The total number of ACMs may be greater than N , but would never exceed 20,000,000.

## Sample Input

```
Results should be directed to standard output. Start each case with Case #: on a single line, where
# is the case number starting from 1. Two consecutive cases should be separated by a single blank
line. No blank line should be produced after the last test case.

For each query, print either Yes or No on a single line, which is the answer to the query.
