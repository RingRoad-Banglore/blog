title: Uva 12825  Happy Robot
---


## Input

```

A robot is moving from (0,0) according to a command sequence. Each character in the sequence is
command:

 L: turn left

 R: turn right

 F: go forward one step

Interestingly, the command sequence contains some wildcard character ?. The robot can treat it
any one of L, R or F at its own wish, which makes it really happy.

Let (x, y) be the final position of the robot, your task is to find out the minimal/maximal possible
value of x and y. Initially the robot is facing east (i.e. facing (1,0) in Cartesian coordinate system).
After a left turn it will face north (i.e. facing (0,1)).
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 1000 test cases. Each case contains a command sequence with no more than 1000
characters.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number, followed by minimal/maximal possible x (in this order), then
the minimal/maximal possible y.

```

## Sample Output

```
F?F

L??

LFFFRF
