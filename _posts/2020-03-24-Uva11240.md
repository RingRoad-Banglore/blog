```
I have a sequence Fred of length n comprised
of integers between 1 and n inclusive. The el-
ements of Fred are pairwise distinct. I want to
find a subsequence Mary of Fred that is as long
as possible and has the property that:

Mary[0] > Mary[1] < Mary[2] > Mary[3] < ...
```

## Input

```
The first line of input will contain a single integer T expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes. T
will be at most 50. T test cases will follow.

Each test case is contained on a single line. A line describing a test case is formatted as follows:

n Fred[0] Fred[1] Fred[2] . . . F red[n 1].

where n and each element of Fred is an integer expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes. No line
will have leading or trailing whitespace, and two adjacent integers on the same line will be separated
by a single space. n will be at most 30000.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a single integer followed by a newline  the length of the longest subsequence
Mary of Fred with the desired properties.

```

## Sample Input

```
4
5 1 2 3 4 5
5 5 4 3 2 1
5 5 1 4 2 3
5 2 4 1 3 5

```

## Sample Output

```
1
2
5
3
```
