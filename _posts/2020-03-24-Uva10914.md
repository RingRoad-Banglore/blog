title: Uva 10914  Abundance and Perfect Numbers
---


## Input

```text
Perfect numbers are the numbers whose sum of divisors are twice the number itself. For example 28 is
a perfect number because the summation of the divisors of 28 is (1+ 2+4+7+14+28) = 56 = 2  28.
Like perfect persons perfect numbers are also rare. The first few even perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496,
8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328 and 2305843008139952128. The sign  is used to denote
the function, the sum of all divisors. So we can write (28) = 56. If n is a perfect number then
(n) 2n = 0. If an even number has only one odd divisor (other than one) then that number is called
almost odd prime. For example 6, 24 are almost odd prime numbers. Let X denote the set of all almost
odd prime numbers. Then the abundance function abun() is defined as

abun(n) =


aiX, ain

(ai) 2ai

for any positive number n. Given the value of n your job is to find the value of abun(n).
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 1001 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer n (1  n  10000000),
which denotes the value of n. Input is terminated by a line where the value of n is zero. This line
should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains two integers separated by a single
space. The first integer is the input number n and the second integer is the value of abun(n).

```

## Sample Output

```text
10
20
1000000
0

```
