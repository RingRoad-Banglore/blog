title: Uva 11881  Internal Rate of Return
---


## Input

```text
In finance, Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate of an investment when NPV equals zero.
Formally, given T , CF0, CF1, , CFT , then IRR is the solution to the following equation:

NPV = CF0 +
CF1

1 + IRR
+

CF2
(1 + IRR)2

+ . . .+
CFT

(1 + IRR)T
= 0

Your task is to find all valid IRRs. In this problem, the initial cash-flow CF0 < 0, while other
cash-flows are all positive (CFi > 0 for all i = 1, 2, . . .).

Important: IRR can be negative, but it must be satisfied that IRR > 1.
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 25 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single
integer T (1  T  10), the number of positive cash-flows. The second line contains T + 1 integers:
CF0, CF1, CF2, , CFT , where CF0 < 0, 0 < CFi < 10000 (i = 1, 2, . . . , T ). The input terminates by
T = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a single line, containing the value of IRR, rounded to two decimal points. If no
IRR exists, print No (without quotes); if there are multiple IRRs, print Too many (without quotes).

```

## Sample Output

```text
