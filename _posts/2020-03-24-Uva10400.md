## Input

```
A game show in Britain has a segment where it gives its contestants a sequence of positive numbers
and a target number. The contestant must make a mathematical expression using all of the numbers
in the sequence and only the operators: +, -, * and /. Each number in the sequence must be used
exactly once, but each operator may be used zero to many times. The expression should be read from
left to right, without regard for order of operations, to calculate the target number. It is possible that
no expression can generate the target number. It is possible that many expressions can generate the
target number.

There are three restrictions on the composition of the mathematical expression:

 the numbers in the expression must appear in the same order as they appear in the input file

 Since the target will always be an integer value (a positive number), you are only allowed to use
/ in the expression when the result will give a remainder of zero.

 You are only allowed to use an operator in the expression, if its result after applying that operator
is an integer from (-32000 +32000).
```

## Output

```
The input file describes multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases n.

Each subsequent line contains the number of positive numbers in the sequence p, followed by p
positive numbers, followed by the target number. Note that 0 < p  100. There may be duplicate
numbers in the sequence. But all the numbers are less than 32000.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output file should contain an expression, including all k numbers and k1 operators plus the equals
sign and the target. Do not include spaces in your expression. Remember that order of operations does
not apply here. If there is no expression possible output NO EXPRESSION (without the quotes). If more
than one expression is possible, any one of them will do.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
3 5 7 4 3
2 1 1 2000
5 12 2 5 1 2 4

```
