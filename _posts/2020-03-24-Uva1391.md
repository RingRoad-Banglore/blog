The Bandulu Space Agency (BSA) has plans for the following three space missions:

 Mission A: Landing on Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter.

 Mission B: Landing on Callisto, the second largest moon of Jupiter.

 Mission C: Landing on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn.

Your task is to assign a crew for each mission. BSA has trained a number of excellent astronauts;
everyone of them can be assigned to any mission. However, if two astronauts hate each other, then it
is not wise to put them on the same mission. Furthermore, Mission A is clearly more prestigious than
Mission B; who would like to go to the second largest moon if there is also a mission to the largest one?
Therefore, the assignments have to be done in such a way that only young, inexperienced astronauts go
to Mission B, and only senior astronauts are assigned to Mission A. An astronaut is considered young
if their age is less than the average age of the astronauts and an astronaut is senior if their age is at
least the averageage. Every astronaut can be assigned to Mission C, regardless of their age (but you
must not assign two astronauts to the same mission if they hate each other).
```

## Input

```
The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers
1  n  100000 and 1  m  100000. The number n is the number of astronauts. The next n lines
specify the age of the n astronauts; each line contains a single integer number between 0 and 200. The
next m lines contains two integers each, separated by a space. A line containing i and j (1  i, j  n)
means that the i-th astronaut and the j-th astronaut hate each other.

The input is terminated by a block with n = m = 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, you have to output n lines, each containing a single letter. This letter is either A,
B, or C. The i-th line describes which mission the i-th astronaut is assigned to. Astronauts that hate
each other should not be assigned to the same mission, only young astronauts should be assigned to
Mission B and only senior astronauts should be assigned to Mission A. If there is no such assignment,
then output the single line No solution. (without quotes).
