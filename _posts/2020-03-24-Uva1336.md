title: Uva 01336  Fixing the Great Wall
---


## Input

```text

The Great Wall of China is truly one of the greatest wonders of the world. In 3-rd century BC, Emperor
Qin Shi Huang connected the defensive structures built earlier by the states of Qin, Yan, and Zhao
kingdoms. The purpose of the wall was to defend against raids by the barbarians from Mongolia and
Manchuria. The wall was extended and renovated in later centuries, creating an impressive 6,700 km
long fortification.

The centuries have left their mark on the wall, there are several sections that need immediate
renovation. These sections have to be repaired as soon as possible since they deteriorate every day: if
we do not fix them now, it will be more expensive to repair them later. Thus the Ministry of Monuments
have designed and built the worlds first Great Wall Automatic Repair Robot (GWARR), to repair the
damaged sections (we are in the 21-st century, arent we?) Your task is to write the software that will
guide the robot and decide the order in which the sections are to be repaired.

For the purpose of this problem, we assume that the Great Wall is a long straight line, and every
location on the wall is identified by a single number (say, the distance from one end). The GWARR is
placed at some location on the wall and it can move with constant speed in both directions. For each
damaged section you are given its location, how much it would cost to repair now, and how the cost
would increase if repaired later. The GWARR works so efficiently that once it is at the exact location
of the damaged section it can repair the wall immediately.

## Output

```text
The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing three integers:
an integer 1  n  1000, the number of damaged sections, an integer 1  v  100, the speed of
the GWARR in distance units/time units, and an integer 1  x  500000, the initial position of
the GWARR. The next n lines describe the n damaged sections that have to be repaired. Each line
contains three integers: the location 1  x  500000 of the section, the cost 0  c  50000 of repairing
it immediately, and 1    50000, the increase in cost per time unit. Therefore, if the section is
repaired after t time units have passed, then we have to pay c+ t units of money. It can be assumed
that the locations of the sections are all different, and the initial location of the robot is not on the list
of damaged seetions.

The input is terminated by a test case with n = v = x = 0.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, you have to output a line containing a single number, the minimum cost of repairing
the wall. This number should be an integer, round down the result, if necessary. It can be assumed
that the minimum cost is not more than 1000000000.

In the optimum solution for the first test case below, we first fix loeation 998 at the cost of 600,
then the location 1010 at the cost of l400, and finally we fix the location 996 at the cost of 84, giving
the total cost 2084.
