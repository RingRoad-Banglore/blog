one political party. Each club is to nominate one of its members to represent it on the town council
so that the number of council members belonging to any given party does not equal or exceed half the
membership of the council. The same person may not represent two clubs; that is there must be a 1-1
relationship between clubs and council members. Your job is to select the council members subject to
these constraints.

input ends with a blank line.
