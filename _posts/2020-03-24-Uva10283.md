title: Uva 10283  The Kissing Circles
---


```
There are some interesting figures below. You can see that we can put within a circle one or more
circles of equal radius. The important property of these circles is that every consecutive circles touch
each other. Given the radius R of the larger circle and the number of small circles N of equal radius
inside,you will have to find the radius of the smaller circles r, the area surrounded by the kissing small
circles (light blue) I and the area outside the kissing small circles but inside the larger circle (light
green) E.

Figures for N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

## Input

```
The input file will contain several lines of inputs. Each line contains non-negative integers R (R  10000)
and N (1  N  100) as described before. Input is terminated by end of file.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This one line contains three floating point numbers
r, I and E as described before. The floating point numbers should have ten digits after the decimal
point. The output will be checked with special correction programs. So you wont have to worry about
small precision errors.
