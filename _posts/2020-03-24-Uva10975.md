title: Uva 10975  Dueues Quiz
---


```
Hesam Dueue Bararie is the showman of a very popular TV quiz: Bararian Nights. In this quiz, there
is a big table of letters with some words hidden in it among diagonal, vertical or horizontal directions.
During the quiz, Dueue tells each one of the contestants a word and they must find the total number
of occurrences of that word in the table.

Figure 1. Dueues Table

Recently, Milk-Farhaad has decided to participate in this TV
quiz and because cheating is permitted during this quiz (!), he
wants you to help him by writing a computer program.

By the way, Milk-Farhaad has bought the whole dictionary
and configurations of the table from Dueue. All he need is a com-
puter program which calculates the total number of occurrences
for each word of the dictionary in the table.

You can see one sample of this table in figure 1. All occur-
rences of the word hello are circled in that. Also, the total
number of occurrences of the word madam is equal to 2 be-
cause it must be counted twice: one from left to right and the
other one from right to left.
```

## Input

```
The first line of the input file is an integer 1  T  10 which is the number of test cases. The first
line of each test case is an integer 1  D  15, 000 which is the number of words in the dictionary that
should be used for this test case. After that, comes D lines each of which containing a word, having
length of no more than 1000 characters, in the dictionary. Words are all constructed from lowercase
letters: a . . . z.

Then, comes a line containing an integer 1  Q  100 , the total number of queries for the test
case. For each query, there will be two integers 1  M , N  100 which are the number of rows and the
number of columns of the table respectively. Next, there are M lines each one containing N characters
representing the configuration of each table of the quiz.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, your program should write a line with the phrase Test Case #i in which i is the
index of the current test case starting from 1. Then comes the answer for each query in that test case.
The answer to each query starts with a line containing the phrase Query #j. Then, all the words from
dictionary which actually occurred in the table of that query should be listed one in each line (or each
in one line!) together with their total number of occurrences in the given table. These words must be
sorted in alphabetical order. There should be an empty line after the output for each test case.
