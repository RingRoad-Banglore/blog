title: Uva 13257  License Plates
---


## Input

```text
On their daily drive to high school, Antonia and her mom Maria, used to challenge each other using
the license plates of other cars. In their country, license plates always contain a string of exactly three
letters. The challenge was to tell the longest word that contains as a subsequence the string of letters
found in a license plate.

For example, if a license plate contained the string OMI, then PROGRAMMING and COLOMBIA
could be used as answers to the challenge. However, the former word was preferred because it was
longer.

Those were the old days. Antonia is now a Computer Science student and Maria wants to make
some changes to keep the challenge interesting to her daughter. In the new version of the challenge,
Maria writes down a word S and Antonia must calculate the number of different three-letter strings
that are each a subsequence of S.

You must write a program to help Maria calculate in advance the output of the new version of the
challenge.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains T (T  0) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case consists of
one single line containing a string S (1  |S|  105). You may assume that S is made only of uppercase
letters from the English alphabet (i.e., A, B, ..., Z) and that there is no blank line between test cases.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print a single line containing the number of different three-letter strings that are
each a subsequence of S.

```

## Sample Output

```text

PROGRAMMING
COLOMBIA
NUEVE
