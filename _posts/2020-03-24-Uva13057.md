title: Uva 13057  Prove Them All
---


```
Alex is a developer at the Formal Methods Inc. central office. Everyday Alex is challenged with new
practical problems related to automated reasoning. Along with her team, Alex is currently working on
new features for a computational theorem prover called Prove Them All (or PTA for short). The
PTA inference engine is based, mainly, on the modus ponens inference rule:

, (  )
 

This rule is commonly used in the following way: for any pair of formulae  and , if there is a proof
of the formula  and a proof of the logical implication (  ), then there is a proof of . In other
words, if  and (  ) are theorems, then  is a theorem too.

Todays challenge for Alex and her team is as follows: given a collection of formulae  and some
relationships among them in the form of logical implication, what is the minimum number of formulae in
 that need to be proven (outside of PTA) so that the rest of formulae in  can be proven automatically
using only modus ponens?
```

## Input

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of the input contains a non-negative integer
indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two blank-separated
integers m and n (1  m  10000 and 0  n  100000), where m is the number of formulae in  of
the form a and n the number of logical implications which have been proven between some of these
formulae. The next n lines contain each two blank-separated integers a and b (1  a, b  m), indicating
that (a  b) is a proven logical implication. Each test case in the input is followed by a blank line.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output one line with the format Case k: c where k is the case number starting
with 1 and c is the minimum number of formulae in  that need to be proven outside of PTA so that
the rest of the formulae in  can be proven automatically using only modus ponens.
