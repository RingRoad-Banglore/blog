title: Uva 01492  Adding New Machine
---


## Input

```

Incredible Crazily Progressing Company (ICPC) suffered a lot with the low speed of procedure. After
investigation, they found that the bottleneck was at Absolutely Crowded Manufactory (ACM). In order
to accelerate the procedure, they bought a new machine for ACM. But a new problem comes, how to
place the new machine into ACM?

ACM is a rectangular factor and can be divided into W  H cells. There are N retangular old
machines in ACM and the new machine can not occupy any cell where there is old machines. The new
machine needs M consecutive cells. Consecutive cells means some adjacent cells in a line. You are
asked to calculate the number of ways to choose the place for the new machine.
```

## Output

```
There are multiple test cases (no more than 50). The first line of each test case contains 4 integers W ,
H, N , M (1  W,H  107, 0  N  50000, 1  M  1000), indicating the width and the length of
the room, the number of old machines and the size of the new machine. Then N lines follow, each of
which contains 4 integers Xi1, Yi1, Xi2 and Yi2 (1  Xi1  Xi2  W , 1  Yi1  Yi2  H), indicating
the coordinates of the i-th old machine. It is guarantees that no cell is occupied by two old machines.
