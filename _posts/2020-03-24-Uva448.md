## Input

```text
Youve been sitting in front of the terminal for three hours savagely coding the Assembler assignment
thats due tomorrow. Your best friend, who finished the program last week and has been rubbing it in
for just as long, saunters up to your terminal and offers, Coke break, slow poke? You take the Coke
he hands you and you lean your head back, savoring the refreshing feeling of the drink as it soothes
your parched throat; too much coding always made your throat raw. Hey, can I look at how far youve
gotten? your friend asks. Sure, you reply, taking another long drink. As youre enjoying your drink
and thinking of what The Real Thing really is, you hear a whispered oops from the direction of
your terminal. What?! you demand. Your friend replies, backing away, I think I just deleted your
source code.

Arrrgggghhh! you spurt as your friend runs from the computer lab, mumbling prayers for divine
protection. You double check and sure enough all you have left of your precious Assembler assignment
is the executable code from your last compile. And you were so close to finishing! Do you take a
zero? No, that last test was a killer. Start over? NOT! Instead, your hands fumble for your Assembler
textbook.... Ah, here we go: a description of the encoding scheme used by the computers assembler.
It doesnt look too bad and you remember most of the hand disassembling you did in class (Thanks
Dr. Baber)! Its decided then, youll just have to write a quick disassembler to convert the executable
code back into your source code so that you can finish your assignment before Cheers comes on. You
open your textbook and begin reading:

Instruction Set
HEX Code Instruction Description

0 ADD [R,A,N],[R,A]
1 SUB [R,A,N],[R,A]
2 MUL [R,A,N],[R,A]
3 DIV [R,A,N],[R,A]
4 MOV [R,A,N],[R,A]
5 BREQ A
6 BRLE A
7 BRLS A
8 BRGE A
9 BRGR A
A BRNE A
B BR A
C AND [R,A,N],[R,A,N],[R,A]
D OR [R,A,N],[R,A,N],[R,A]
E XOR [R,A,N],[R,A,N],[R,A]
F NOT [R,A]

R = Register, A = Address, N = Number

ADD [R,A,N],[R,A] means that the ADD instruction takes two operands. The first can be a register, an
address, or a number, and the second operand is either a register or an address.

Opcodes are 4 bits in length. An operand is made up of two fields: a mode and a value. The mode
is two bits and the value is fourteen bits for a total of sixteen bits. The possible values for mode are:

2-bit code Type of operand
00 Register
01 Absolute
10 PC-Relative
11 Constant

The value field for a register operand (mode = 00) specifies the number of the register. For example,
if the value field contained a seven then that would specify register number 7, written R7. The valid
registers are R0 through R1023.

The value field for an absolute operand (mode = 01) specifies the absolute address that the operand
is to be stored at. For example, if the value field contained the number 110, that would denote address
location 110, which is written $110. Valid addresses are $0 through $16383.

The value field for a PC-Relative operand (mode = 10) specifies the offset of the address relative to
the program counter. (On this computer, all PC-relative offsets are non-negative). For example, if the
value field contained the number 45, that would specify the address location (Program Counter) + 45,
which is written PC+45. Valid offsets are from 0 to 16363.

The value field for a constant operand (mode = 11) specifies a constant - a number between 0 and
16383. For example, if the value field contained the number 1276, then that would specify the actual
number 1276 and is written as 1276.

## Output

```text
Your task is to write a program which will read in a text file that contains the hexadecimal listing of
an executable program. Each line in the text file will contain exactly 30 hexadecimal digits except for
the last line which will contain from 1 to 30 hexadecimal digits.

```

## Sample Input

```text
