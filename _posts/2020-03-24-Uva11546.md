## Input

```

Hurdles is a common event in athletics where the runners race in running tracks containing hurdles
(obstacles). For the race some hurdles are placed evenly spaced along a straight running course. They
are positioned so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner.

The organizers of 20012 Olympic games are planning to introduce a hurdles event in swimming. For
this purpose, some hurdles will be placed in the swimming pool used in the competition. Lets describe
the construction of a swimming pool at first. A pool is L meters long & is divided into K equal size
lanes across the width. Each participant swims along his own lane. As events of various length take
place in the same pool, measurement of length is very critical. So, there is a mark after every meter
along the length of the pool starting from 0 in one end. As it is said earlier, there are some hurdles
placed in the pool. There is at most one hurdle in a lane between two adjacent length marks. Again,
a hurdle will always be between two adjacent marks. Now, the hurdles are not uniformly distributed.
For example, in a 5 meter long pool with 2 lanes, the first lane may have 2 hurdles, one between 1m
& 2m while another between 3m & 4m. The second lane may have 1 hurdle, between 0m & 1m. For
ensuring a fair race, the course must be defined in a way so that all the participants have to face same
number of hurdles. In other words, you are to select two length marks from the pool so that there are
same number of hurdles placed in every lane between these two length marks. You can safely assume
that, a race course will always start in a length mark.
```

## Output

```
There is at most 60 test cases. The first line of every test case contains two integers, L (0 < L  50000)
& K (1  K  30). Each of the next K lines describes a lane. Each of these lines starts with an
integer n (0  n  5000), the number of hurdles in that lane. Then follows n integers pi (1  i  n
&& 0  pi < L). Each integer pi means there is a hurdle between length mark pi & pi + 1.

The input is terminated with a case where L = K = 0.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print a single line containing Case #X: Y meter(s) where X is the case number
& Y is the longest race that can take place in that pool. The first test case is the one mentioned above.
