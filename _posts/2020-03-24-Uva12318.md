title: Uva 12318  Digital Roulette

## Input

```text
John is developing a videogame that allows players to bet in a wall roulette. Players may bet for integer
numbers from 0 to N , for some N  0 that represents the maximum number in the roulette.

Of course, the roulette behaves digitally. As a matter of fact, John designed its way to choose a
value in the interval 0..N (the result of spinning the roulette) with a digital trigger that moves the
roulette with a force that depends on an integer value x randomly chosen in the interval 0..M , where
M  0 (M is the maximal appliable force). The roulette turns around a distance equivalent to P (x),
where P is a polynomial with integer coefficients. One distance unit represents a displacement of one
roulette number, counting clockwise.

It is clear that some result values may be produced by different chosen force values. Also, depending
on the mechanism parameters, some numbers in the roulette may be not attainable regardless of the
force value. For example, if N = 7, M = 5 and P (x) = x2 + 1, the mechanism can generate only three
different results:

John wants to know how many different result values may be attained by his mechanism. Can you
help him?

## Output

```text
There are several cases to analyze. Each case is described by three lines:

 The first line contains two non-negative integer numbers N and M , separated by a blank (1 
N  107, 0  M  105).

 The second line contains an integer k, the grad of the polynomial P (0  k  10).

 The third line contains k + 1 integers a0, a1, . . . , ak separated by blanks, indicating the integer
coefficients that define the polynomial P , i.e., P (x) = akxk +   +a1x+a0. You can assume that
0  ai  N for each 0  i  k. If k > 0 then you may assume that ak = 0.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.
