```
In spite of the scarcity of snowfall in Madrid, interest in winter
sports is growing in the city, especially with regard to skiing.
Many people spend several weekends or even full weeks improving
their skills in the mountains.

In this problem we deal with only one of the multiple alpine
skiing disciplines: slalom. A course is constructed by laying out
a series of gates, which are formed by two poles. The skier must
pass between the two poles forming each gate. The winner is the
skier who takes the least time to complete the course while not
missing any of the gates.

You have recently started to learn to ski, but you have already
set yourself the goal of taking part in the Winter Olympic Games
of 2018, for which Madrid will presumably present a candidature.
As part of the theoretical training, you need to write a program that calculates, given a starting point
and a series of gates, the minimum-length path starting from the point given and passing through each
gate until you reach the last one, which is the finish line. You may assume that the gates are horizontal
and are ordered from highest to lowest, so that you need to pass through them in order. You consider
yourself an accomplished skier, so you can make any series of turns, no matter how difficult, and your
only concern is minimizing the total length of the path.
```

## Input

```
The first line of each case gives the number of gates n (1  n  1 000). The next line contains two
floating point numbers, the Cartesian coordinates x and y of the starting position, in that order. Next
come n lines with three floating point numbers each, y x1 x2, meaning that the next gate is a horizontal
line from (x1, y) to (x2, y). You can safely assume that x1 < x2. The values of y are strictly decreasing
and are always smaller than that of the starting position. The last gate represents the finish line. All
coordinates are between 500 000 and 500 000, inclusive. A value of 0 for n means the end of the input.
A blank line follows each case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line with the minimum distance needed to reach the finish line. Your
answer should be accurate to within an absolute or relative error of 107.
