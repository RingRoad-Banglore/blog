title: Uva 10820  Send a Table
---


```
When participating in programming contests, you sometimes face the following problem: You know
how to calcutale the output for the given input values, but your algorithm is way too slow to ever pass
the time limit. However hard you try, you just cant discover the proper break-off conditions that would
bring down the number of iterations to within acceptable limits.

Now if the range of input values is not too big, there is a way out of this. Let your PC rattle for half
an hour and produce a table of answers for all possible input values, encode this table into a program,
submit it to the judge, et voila: Accepted in 0.000 seconds! (Some would argue that this is cheating,
but remember: In love and programming contests everything is permitted).

Faced with this problem during one programming contest, Jimmy decided to apply such a technique.
But however hard he tried, he wasnt able to squeeze all his pre-calculated values into a program small
enough to pass the judge. The situation looked hopeless, until he discovered the following property
regarding the answers: the answers where calculated from two integers, but whenever the two input
values had a common factor, the answer could be easily derived from the answer for which the input
values were divided by that factor. To put it in other words:

Say Jimmy had to calculate a function Answer(x, y) where x and y are both integers in the range
[1, N ]. When he knows Answer(x, y), he can easily derive Answer(k  x, k  y), where k is any integer
from it by applying some simple calculations involving Answer(x, y) and k.

For example if N = 4, he only needs to know the answers for 11 out of the 16 possible input value
combinations: Answer(1, 1), Answer(1, 2), Answer(2, 1), Answer(1, 3), Answer(2, 3), Answer(3, 2),
Answer(3, 1), Answer(1, 4), Answer(3, 4), Answer(4, 3) and Answer(4, 1). The other 5 can be de-
rived from them (Answer(2, 2), Answer(3, 3) and Answer(4, 4) from Answer(1, 1), Answer(2, 4) from
Answer(1, 2), and Answer(4, 2) from Answer(2, 1)). Note that the function Answer is not symmetric,
so Answer(3, 2) can not be derived from Answer(2, 3).

Now what we want you to do is: for any values of N from 1 upto and including 50000, give the
number of function Jimmy has to pre-calculate.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains at most 600 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer less than 50001 which
indicates the value of N . Input is terminated by a line which contains a zero. This line should not be
processed.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer which indicates how
many values Jimmy has to pre-calculate for a certain value of N .
