title: Uva 11006  Wheel Good
---


## Input

```
Ug caveman. Ug real smart caveman. Ug invent many things. Ug invent spear. Ug invent fire (and
escape with much hair left). Now Ug want invent wheel. Ug not know math. Ug never heard of circle.
Ug not have good tools. But Ug not give up. Ug invent wheel if take Ug all day.

Ug want carve wheel out of N N square stone. Ug want wheel be convex, Ug hate vex. Ug
want wheel be 4-way rotationally symmetric, Ug think that good bullet point. Ug not good with
curve. Ug carve straight lines between lattice points only. Ug want wheel have much much edges,
so roll good.

Ug have Dual Core 3.2GHz Pentium D Linux Box but Ug not know how program. Help Ug make
wheel with most edges.
```

## Output

```
Ug have at most 20 blocks, Ug want carve one wheel from each block. Ug give size N of each block on
one line. N no more than 100000. After Ug done, Ug give 0 on line.

```

## Sample Input

```
Block have coordinates from (0,0) to (N,N). Tell Ug vertices in counterclockwise order, starting on
the x-axis where Ug carve to make convex 90-degree rotationally symmetric polygon with maximum
number of edges. (Ug hope big words make wheel roll good!) Maybe many possible wheel, Ug accept
all. Give Ug blank line after each wheel.

```

## Sample Output
