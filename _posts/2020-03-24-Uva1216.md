title: Uva 01216  The Bug Sensor Problem
---


## Input

```text

Mr. Macdonald is a farmer. He has a huge land to manage. To monitor the number of bugs in his
land, he asks help from the famous professor T. Professor T is an expert on computer science.

Professor T studies several efficient approach and suggests Mr. Macdonald to setup a wireless sensor
system in his land. The system will be setup as follows:

In each predefined location, one wireless sensor will be established. Since all sensors are operated by
batteries, the powers consumed by the sensors are determined by the effective communication distance
(ECD) between sensors. Mr. Macdonald is a nice old man. He prefers not to trouble professor T much.
Therefore, he decides that all sensors will be set in the same power level. That is, all sensors will have
the same effective communication distance.

The land is so huge that it is not possible to cover all spots by the sensors. However, each sensor can
broadcast the collected data to their neighbors as long as the neighbors are in its effective communication
distance. But the total number of sensors is relative small comparing to the land. Mr. Macdonald
needs to travel the whole land to collect the data from sensors everyday.

Mr. Macdonald is getting old. He hopes that the computer in his house can collect all data from
all sensors automatically. Again, he called professor T for help. This time, professor T suggests Mr.
Macdonald to setup a base station in his house. The house is right in the center of the land.

Due to the limited budget, the number of receiver/transmitter Mr. Macdonald can afford is lim-
ited and is relatively small comparing to the total number of sensors. It is impossible to assign re-
ceiver/transmitter to every sensor. Therefore, sensors with no receiver/transmitter need to send their
data to the sensor with receiver/transmitter (directly or indirect) first, After that, the sensor with
receiver/transmitter sends all data it receives from other sensors along with the data it collects back to
the base station. You may assume that the receiver/transmitter has enough power such that it always
can send data back to the base station.

Professor T promises to write the necessary software to make all sensors work together in this way,
but one important issue need to be studied. If all sensors are set at the maximum power level, all
sensors might be able to send their data back without troubles, but the battery will be out-of-power
soon. To save power, professor T need to decide the minimum power level needed such that the battery
can have longest operating time while all sensor data can be col- lected by the base station.

Although professor T is good in programming, he is weak in algorithm design. Your goal is to
help professor T to write a program to determine the minimum power level needed to set all sensors
accordingly. To simplify our problem, please report the ECD corresponding to the minimum power
level. Please apply the ceiling function to your answer.

Here is an example:

Assume that the land is 10 10. There are three sensors, located at (1,1), (2,1) and (8,7). We also
assume that there are 2 receiver/transmitters. In this example, the ECD of all sensors need to be set
at 1.

## Output

```text
The first line contains the number of test cases w, 1  w  10. Then the w test cases are listed one by
one. In each test case, the first line is a single integer, representing the number of receiver/transmitters
for that test case. After that, the test case consists of some lines with two numbers each line:

X Y

Here two numbers are separated by a single blank, X is an integer, denoting the x-coordinate of the
sensor, and Y is also an integer, denoting the y-coordinate of the same sensor. Each test case is ended
by the following line: -1

Please note that the land is a rectangle with dimemsions 100000 100000.
