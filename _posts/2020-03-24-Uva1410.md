title: Uva 01410  Expensive Drink
---


## Input

```

There are some water, milk and wine in your kitchen. Your naughty little sister made some strange
drinks by mixing them together, and then adds some sugar! She wants to know whether they taste
good, but she doesnt want to try them herself. She needs your help.

Your sister knows that you dont want to drink them either (anyone wants to?), so she gives you a
chance to escape: if you can guess the price of a special drink, she gives you freedom. Warning: she
loves her special drink so much that you should never under-estimate its cost! That is, youre to find
the most expensive possible price of it.

The price of each drink equals to its cost. If the amounts of water, milk, wine and sugar used in the
drink are a1, a2, a3 and a4 respectively, and the unit costs of water, milk, wine and sugar are c1, c2, c3
and c4 respectively, then the drink costs a1c1 + a2c2 + a3c3 + a4c4. To give you some hope to win, she
told you the costs of exactly n ordinary drinks. Furthermore, she promised that the total cost of sugar
a4c4 is always a real number in the interval [L,R], in any drink.

Sadly, you dont know the exact price of anything (youre a programmer, not a housewife!), but you
know that water is the cheapest; wine is the most expensive, i.e., 0  c1  c2  c3. Then the best thing
you can do is to assume units costs can be any real numbers satisfying this inequality .

Write a program to find the highest possible price of the special drink.

## Output

```
The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains three positive integers
n, L, R (1  n  100, 0  L  R  100). The next n lines each contain four non-negative integer
a1, a2, a3, p (0  a1, a2, a3  100, 0  p  10000), the amount of water, milk and wine, and the
price. The last line of the case contains three integers a1, a2, a3 (0  a1, a2, a3  100), the drink to be
estimated. The last test case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number and the highest possible price to four decimal places. If the
input is selfcontradictory, output Inconsistent data. If the price can be arbitrarily large, output
Too expensive!.
