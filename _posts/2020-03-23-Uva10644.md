10644 Floor Tiles
Jack is building a new house. He would like to tile his kitchen with congruent pieces
formed by removing a 1×1 square from a 2×2 square.

He already knows that his kitchen will have length between L1 and L2 inclusive,
and its width will be between W1 and W2 inclusive. Jack insists his kitchen to be
a perfect rectangle. Of course, the floor must be tiled completely using these pieces
(no overlaps, no spaces).

Determine the number of dimensions for Jack’s Kitchen.

## Input
You will be given K, the number of test cases. The next K lines will contain four positive integers
separated by spaces: L1 L2 W1 W2, all of which are less than 1000.

## Output
For each test case you are to output a single line containing the number of different dimensions for
Jacks Kitchen. A 2×1 kitchen is different from a 1×2 kitchen.

## Sample Input
<p>2</p><p>2 2 2 3</p><p>2 3 3 4</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>1</p><p>2</p>
