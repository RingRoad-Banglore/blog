title: Uva 10401  Injured Queen Problem
---


## Input

```
Chess is a two-player board game believed to
have been played in India as early as the sixth
century. However, in this problem we will not
discuss about chess, rather we will talk about a
modified form of the classic n- queens problem.
I know you are familiar with plotting n-queens
on a chess board with the help of a classic back-
tracking algorithm. If you write that algorithm
now you will find that there are 92 ways of plot-
ting 8 queens in an 8  8 board provided no
queens attack each other.

In this problem we will talk about injured
queens who can move only like a king in hori-
zontal and diagonal direction from current po-
sition but can reach any row from current po-
sition like a normal chess queen. You will have to find the number of possible arrangements with such
injured queens in a particular (nn) board (with some additional constraints), such that no two queens
attack each other.

Fig: Injured Queen at a6 can reach the adjacent grey squares. Queen at e4 can reach adjacent grey
squares. The injured queen positions are black and the reachable places are grey.

## Output

```
Input file contains several lines of input. Each line expresses a certain board status. The length of these
status string is the board dimension n (0 < n  15). The first character of the string denotes the status
of first column, the second character of the string denotes the status of the second column and so on.

So if the first character of the status string is 2, it means that we are looking for arrangements (no two
injured queen attack each other) which has injured queen in column a, row 2. The possible numbers
for rows are 1, 2, 3, . . . , D,E, F which indicates row 1, 2, 3... 13, 14, 15. If any column contains ?
it means that in that column the injured queen can be in any row. So a status string 1?4??3 means
that you are asked to find out total number of possible arrangements in a (6  6) chessboard which
has three of its six injured queens at a1, c4 and f3. Also note that there will be no invalid inputs. For
example 1?51 is an invalid input because a (4  4) chessboard does not have a fifth row.

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line should contain an integer which indicates
the total number of possible arrangements of the corresponding input status string.
