```
We programmers know and love Pascals triangle: an array of
numbers with 1 at the top and whose entries are the sum of
the two numbers directly above (except numbers at both ends,
which are always 1). For programming this generation rule, the
triangle is best represented left-aligned; then the numbers on the
left column and on the top row equal 1 and every other is the sum
of the numbers immediately above and to its left. The numbers
highlighted in bold correspond to the base of Pascals triangle of
height 5:

1 1 1 1 1
1 2 3 4
1 3 6
1 4
1

Pascals hyper-pyramids generalize the triangle to higher dimensions. In 3 dimensions, the value at
position (x, y, z) is the sum of up to three other values:

 (x, y, z  1), the value immediately below it if we are not on the bottom face (z = 0);
 (x, y  1, z), the value immediately behind if we are not on the back face (y = 0);
 (x 1, y, z), the value immediately to the left if we are not on the leftmost face (x = 0).

The following figure depicts Pascals 3D-pyramid of height 5 as a series of plane cuts obtained by
fixing the value of the z coordinate.

For example, the number at position x = 1, y = 2, z = 1 is the sum of the values at (0, 2, 1), (1, 1, 1)
and (1, 2, 0), namely, 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. The base of the pyramid corresponds to a plane of positions such
that x+ y + z = 4 (highlighted in bold above).

The size of each layer grows quadratically with the height of the pyramid, but there are many
repeated values due to symmetries: numbers at positions that are permutations of one another must
be equal. For example, the numbers at positions (0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 0) and (2, 1, 0) above are all equal to 3.

Write a program that, given the number of dimensions D of the hyper-space and the height H of a
hyper-pyramid, computes the set of numbers at the base.
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

A single line with two positive integers: the number of dimensions, D, and the height of the hyper-
pyramid, H.
