## Input

```
ETS is an QSA based organization that conducts ETS (Extra Terrestrial Scholastic) Exams to allow
Extra Terrestrial beings (Aliens) to study in QSA. Many aliens being afraid of ETS exams, study in
Euphoria instead. Each year billions of ETS exams are conducted as more than a trillion Aliens appear
in it from all planets of the universe to get the coveted opportunity of studying in QSA.

As billions of exams are conducted so it is simply impossible for ETS to set new questions for ETS
exams. That is why they use the same math problem in many exams by changing the figures/numbers
only. For each math problem they write an intelligent program that can change the figures or numbers
intelligently. Lets consider a typical ETS math problem now:

A dice with n faces are thrown. All the faces are equally likely to appear on top. The numbers
1, 2, 3, . . . , n are written on the n faces. So the sample space of the event that denotes the number
appearing on the top of the dice is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , n}. Event A is defined as {a1, a2, a3, . . .} and
Event B is defined as {b1, b2, b3, . . .}. Now please verify whether or not event A and B are independent
with each other.

Now it is obvious that for different values of n and different definition of event A and B, these two
events can be dependent or independent. But if values of n, A, B are randomly chosen then the in
most cases A and B will be dependent. So an intelligent program is needed to assign the values of n, A
and B. Your task in this problem is something similar. Given the values of n you will have to find the
number of event pairs which are independent. An event is a subset of the sample space. For example
the event {1, 2, 4} denotes that the dice shows 1, 2 or 4. No event can be empty in a valid independent
event pair. For n = 3 the sample space of the dice (A dice with three faces!!!) is {1, 2, 3} and there are
13 possible independent event pairs. These are:

(1) {1} {1,2,3}
(2) {2} {1,2,3}
(3) {1,2} {1,2,3}
(4) {3} {1,2,3}
(5) {1,3} {1,2,3}
(6) {2,3} {1,2,3}
(7) {1,2,3} {1}
(8) {1,2,3} {2}
(9) {1,2,3} {1,2}
(10) {1,2,3} {3}
(11) {1,2,3} {1,3}
(12) {1,2,3} {2,3}
(13) {1,2,3} {1,2,3}

Two events A and B are independent if and only if P (AB) = P (A)  P (B).

## Output

```
The input file contains at most 200 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer n (0 < n < 1001).
Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero. This line should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer which denotes the value
P modulo 100000000. Here P is the number of independent event pairs that can be created from the

sample space {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. P can be a very large number for larger values of n. So you are asked to
print the modulo 100000000 value.
