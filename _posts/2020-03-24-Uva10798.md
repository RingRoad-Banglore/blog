title: Uva 10798  Be Wary of Roses
---


```
Youve always been proud of your prize rose garden. However,
some jealous fellow gardeners will stop at nothing to gain an edge
over you. They have kidnapped, blindfolded, and handcuffed you,
and dumped you right in the middle of your treasured roses! You
need to get out, but youre not sure you can do it without tram-
pling any precious flowers.

Fortunately, you have the layout of your garden committed to
memory. It is an N N collection of square plots (N odd), some
containing roses. You are standing on a square marble plinth in
the exact center. Unfortunately, you are quite disoriented, and
have no idea which direction youre facing! Thanks to the plinth,
you can orient yourself facing one of North, East, South, or
West, but you have no way to know which.

You must come up with an escape path that tramples the fewest possible roses, no matter which
direction youre initially facing. Your path must start in the center, consist only of horizontal and
vertical moves, and end by leaving the grid.
```

## Input

```
Every case begins with N , the size of grid (1  N  21), on a line. N lines with N characters each
follow, describing the garden: . indicates a plot without any roses, R indicates the location of a rose,
and P stands for the plinth in the center.

Input will end on a case where N = 0. This case should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output a line containing the minimum guaranteed number of roses you can step on while
escaping.
