title: Uva 11489  Integer Game
---


```

Two players, S and T, are playing a game where they make alternate moves. S plays first.
In this game, they start with an integer N . In each move, a player removes one digit from the

integer and passes the resulting number to the other player. The game continues in this fashion until
a player finds he/she has no digit to remove when that player is declared as the loser.

With this restriction, its obvious that if the number of digits in N is odd then S wins otherwise T
wins. To make the game more interesting, we apply one additional constraint. A player can remove a
particular digit if the sum of digits of the resulting number is a multiple of 3 or there are no digits left.

Suppose N = 1234. S has 4 possible moves. That is, he can remove 1, 2, 3, or 4. Of these, two of
them are valid moves.

 Removal of 4 results in 123 and the sum of digits = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6; 6 is a multiple of 3.

 Removal of 1 results in 234 and the sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9; 9 is a multiple of 3.

The other two moves are invalid.

If both players play perfectly, who wins?

## Input

```
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 60) that determines the number of test cases. Each case is
a line that contains a positive integer N . N has at most 1000 digits and does not contain any zeros.

```

## Output

```
For each case, output the case number starting from 1. If S wins then output S otherwise output T.

## Sample Output

```

Case 1: S

Case 2: T

Case 3: T
