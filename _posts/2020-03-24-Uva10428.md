title: Uva 10428  The Roots
---


## Input

```text
A polynomial equation has the following form:

anx
n + an1x

n1 + an2x
n2 + . . .+ a1x

1 + a0 = 0

Here x is variable and an, an1, ... etc. are known as coefficient. So to specify a polynomial equation
we need the values of the coefficients only. The roots of a polynomial equation are the values of x for
which the value of LHS is zero. In this problem you will have to find the roots of a polynomial equation.
You can assume that a polynomial equation of degree n should have n real roots and all the roots are
strictly different.
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains less than 5001 lines of input.

Each line contains an integer N (N  5) followed by (N + 1) floating point numbers. Here N
is the order of the polynomial equation. The next (N + 1) numbers denote the values of an, an1,
an2, ..., a1, a0. These absolute values of these coefficients will be less than 1e9 or 1000000000 and the
absolute values of the roots will be less than 25. So each line contains information about one polynomial
equation.

Input is terminated by a line where N = 0.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line starts with the string Equation S: here
S is the output serial number as shown in the sample output. This string is followed by N floating
point numbers, which are the roots of the corresponding input equation. The roots should be printed
in ascending order of their values and rounded up to four digits after the decimal point. All the root
values are preceded by a single space. The judge input is designed in such a way that if your precision
is relatively low (values less than 1e-10 are considered as zero) you will face no precision errors. Of
course your solution must be correct and you must be well aware of the limitations of different root
finding methods.
