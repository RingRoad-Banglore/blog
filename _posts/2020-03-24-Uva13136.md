title: Uva 13136  Recurrences
---


## Input

```
Ailin recently learned linear recurrences, but apparently not the right way. She can not solve a problem
proposed by her father ...

Can you help her? She has the following system of recurrences:

An = 4An1  3Bn1  3Cn1
Bn = 5An1  4Bn1  4Cn1
Cn = Bn1 An1

And she needs to calculate the value of S(n) defined as follows:

S(n) =

{
0 if n = 0
S(n 1) +An +Bn + Cn if n  1

She knows that there is a method to calculate this result quickly, but she is something lazy and asks
you for help to find the answers.
```

## Output

```
The entry contains a number T , the number of test cases (1  T  5105). Each of the following T
lines contain an integer n (1  n  91018) and the values of A0, B0, C0 (0  A0, B0, C0  9).

```

## Sample Input

```
The output will contain T lines, each with the value of S(n) defined above. Since the sum can be
very large, print only the last digit. More formally, in each case print a no negative number, the result
modulo 10.

Remember that if a mod M < 0 then you should add M to the result, so the answer is no negative.
More formally you can use: ((a mod M) +M) mod M

```

## Sample Output

```
5
1 1 2 3
4 1 2 3
7 1 2 3
100001 1 2 1
900000 1 2 9

```
