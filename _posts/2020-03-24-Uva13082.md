title: Uva 13082  High School Assembly
---


```
Its Saturday morning of a new week and students of National High School have gathered on the central
ground for an assembly.

At the beginning, students from different classes stand in their own lines. Then the class teachers
of each class move over from front to back and organize the line according to the increasing order of
students heights. They can pick a student from any position and send him to the end of the line.

Mr. Kapono Khan is the class teacher of 7th grade. He doesnt like this job of walking along the
line back and forth. So he wants to organize the students with minimal number of moves. As usual,
you are here to help Mr. Khan. Given the heights of each student of his class, your job is to find out
minimum number of moves required to sort the students based on the increasing order of their heights.
Picking up a student from any position and sending him to the end is defined as a move for this
problem. Luckily students of his class have unique heights.
```
