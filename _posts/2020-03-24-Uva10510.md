```
A directed graph is a set V of vertices and a set of E  V  V edges. An
edge (u, v) is said to be directed from u to v (the edge (v, u) has the opposite
direction). A directed cycle in a directed graph is a sequence of edges

(u1, v1), (u2, v2), . . . , (uk, vk)

such that ui+1 = vi for i = 1, . . . , k  1, and u1 = vk. The directed cycle is
simple if ui = uj whenever i = j (i.e., if it does not pass through a vertex
twice).

In a strongly connected directed graph, there is for every pair u, v of
vertices some directed cycle (not necessarily simple) that visits both u and v.

A directed graph is a cactus if and only if it is strongly connected and each edge is part of exactly
one directed simple cycle. The first graph is a cactus, but the second one is not since for instance the
edge (0,1) is in two simple cycles.

The reason for the name is that a cactus consists of several simple cycles connected to each other
in a tree-like fashion, making it look somewhat like a cactus.

Write a program that given a directed graph determines if it is a cactus or not. The graph can have
several thousand vertices.

## Input

```
The first line contains an integer which is the number of test cases (less than 20). Each test case starts
a line with an integer n > 0 followed by line with an integer m > 0 giving the number of vertices (n)
and edges (m) in a graph (at most 10,000 of each). The vertices are numbered 0 through n  1. The
following m lines describe the edges as pairs of numbers u, v denoting an edge directed from u to v.
There will never be more than one edge from u to v for any pair of vertices u and v. There are no
loops, i.e., no edges from a vertex to itself.

```

## Output

```
For each test case output a single line with a single string. Output YES if the graph is a cactus, and
output NO if it is not.
