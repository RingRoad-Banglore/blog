---


```
The probability of n heads in a row tossing a fair coin is 2n. Calculate the probability for any positive
integer n (1  n  1000000).
```

## Input

```
A list of valid values of n (one per line).

```

## Output

```
Print a table of n and 2n in the following for the given values of n, using the following format:

2^-n = z.xxxe-y

where z is a nonzero decimal digit, each x is a decimal digit and each y is a decimal integer with no
leading zeros or spaces.

```

## Sample Input

```
1
100
10000
1000000

```

## Sample Output

```
2^-1 = 5.000e-1
2^-100 = 7.889e-31
2^-10000 = 5.012e-3011
2^-1000000 = 1.010e-301030
```
