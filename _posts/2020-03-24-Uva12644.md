title: Uva 12644  Vocabulary
---


## Input

```

Jack and Jill were arguing about which one of them had the richest vocabulary. Because neither one
of them gave up, Jill proposed a game to test Jacks vocabulary:

 Jill would write down a list of strings, each one of them called a challenge.

 A challenge s in Jills list is solved by Jack if he could say a word w from his vocabulary, such
that every letter occurs in w with at least the same multiplicity that occurs in s. Two different
challenges may be not solved with the same word.

Jacks vocabulary is defined as the set of words he knows. Given a list of Jills challenges, Jack
would like to know how many of them he can solve.
```

## Output

```
There are several cases to solve. Each case begins with a line containing blank-separated numbers V
and C: the former is the number of words in Jacks vocabulary (1  V  500) and the latter is the
number of challenges presented by Jill (1  C  500). Each one of the next V lines contains a word
in Jacks vocabulary. Then, each one of the next C lines contains a challenge made by Jill. Both, the
words in Jacks vocabulary and the challenges made by Jill, consist of 1 to 30 lowercase English letters
(a. . .z). Jacks vocabulary does not contain duplicate words.

```
