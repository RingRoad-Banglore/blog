## Input

```
Oooooooooooooooh!

If I could do the easy mathematics like my school days!!
I can guarantee, that Id not make any mistake this time!!

Says a smart university student!!

But his teacher even smarter  Ok! Id assign you such
projects in your software lab. Dont be so sad.

Really!!  the students feels happy. And he feels so happy
that he cannot see the smile in his teachers face.

The first project for the poor student was to make a calculator
that can just perform the basic arithmetic operations.

But like many other university students he doesnt like to do
any project by himself. He just wants to collect programs from
here and there. As you are a friend of him, he asks you to write
the program. But, you are also intelligent enough to tackle this kind of people. You agreed to write
only the (integer) division and mod (% in C/C++) operations for him.
```

## Output

```
Input is a sequence of lines. Each line will contain an input number. One or more spaces. A sign
(division or mod). Again spaces. And another input number. Both the input numbers are non-
negative integer. The first one may be arbitrarily long. The second number n will be in the range
(0 < n < 231).

```

## Sample Input

```
A line for each input, each containing an integer. See the sample input and output. Output should not
contain any extra space.

```

## Sample Output

```
110 / 100
99 % 10
2147483647 / 2147483647
2147483646 % 2147483647
