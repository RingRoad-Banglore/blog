## Input

```

Carl is right now the happiest child in the world: he has just learned this morning what the binary
system is. He learned, for instance, that the binary representation of a positive integer k is a string
anan1 . . . a1a0 where each ai is a binary digit 0 or 1, starting with an = 1, and such that k = 

n
i=0ai2

i.
It is really nice to see him turning decimal numbers into binary numbers, and then adding and even
multiplying them.

Caesar is Carls older brother, and he just cant stand to see his little brother so happy. So he has
prepared a challenge: Look Carl, I have an easy question for you: I will give you two integers A and
B, and you have to tell me how many 1s there are in the binary representation of all the integers from
A to B, inclusive. Get ready. Carl agreed to the challenge. After a few minutes, he came back with a
list of the binary representation of all the integers from 1 to 100. Caesar, Im ready. Caesar smiled
and said: Well, let me see, I choose A = 1015 and B = 1016. Your list will not be useful.

Carl hates loosing to his brother so he needs a better solution fast. Can you help him?

## Output

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.
A single line that contains two integers A and B (1  A  B  1016).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output a line with an integer representing the total number of digits 1 in the binary
representation of all the integers from A to B, inclusive.
