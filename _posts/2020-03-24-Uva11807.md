title: Uva 11807  Dumb Eucelics Pyramid Walk
---


```
Little ant Eucelics has been given a holy task. He is to walk from anthill Almapores to another anthill
Bigopores, all on his own, unguided by any other ant through a flat desert terrain under the scorching
heat of the sun. As if that was not enough, there is a huge pyramid structure standing on the ground,
which might force him to take a longer route. He has therefore asked you to calculate the shortest
possible distance that he must travel in order to reach his goal, walking around or over the pyramid if
necessary.

The pyramid has a square base on the ground. For this problem we will use a Cartesian coordinate
system with its origin on the ground at the exact center of the base of the pyramid, while axes are drawn
such that the corners of the base square are at coordinates (-10,-10), (-10,10), (10,10) and (10,-10).
```

## Input

```
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input is an integer T ( 150), the number
of test cases. This line is followed by T more lines, each specifying a single test case. Each of these
lines specify five space-separated real numbers are in the format Ax Ay Bx By h, each with at most
two digits after the decimal point. The location of Almapores and Bigopores are given by (Ax, Ay) and
(Bx, By) respectively. The height of the pyramid is given by h. All lengths are measured in meters.
You may assume that the two anthills at distinct locations, and none of the two anthills lie inside the
pyramid. The inputs will be such that |Ax|, |Ay|, |Bx|, |By|  25, 0  h  150.

```

## Output

```
You must produce a single line of output for each input test case. Each line should be of the format
Case c: d, where c is the serial number of the case starting from 1, and d is the shortest walking
distance as asked for in the problem. Your answer will be accepted if absolute error of your output is
less than 106.
