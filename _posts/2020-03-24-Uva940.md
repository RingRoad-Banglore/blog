```

In the decimal system an autobiographical number is a natural number with no more than 10 digits,

N = d0d1 . . . dr1 (1  r  10)

such that d0 is the number of 0s in N , d1 is the number of 1s in N , d2 is the number of 2s in N , and
so on.

The notion of autobiographical number can be generalized to any base b  2.
Let A = [s0, s1, . . . , sb1] be an alphabet, whose symbols s0, s1, . . . , sb1 correspond to the values

0, 1, . . . , b 1, respectively: that is, value (si) = i. Then, an autobiographical number in base b (under
the alphabet A) is a natural number with no more than b symbols,

N = d0d1 . . . dr1 (1  r  b)

such that value(d0) is the number of s0s in N , value(d1) is the number of s1s in N , . . ., and value(dr1)
is the number of sr1s in N .

For example:

 42101000 is an autobiographical number in base 10, under the alphabet [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8,9], because it has four 0s, two 1s, one 2, zero 3s, one 4, zero 5s, zero 6s, and zero 7s;

 A2100000001000 is an autobiographical number in base 16, under the alphabet [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F]. There are value(A)=10 0s, two 1s, etc.

Given an alphabet A, with b symbols, determine all autobiographical numbers in base b under A.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains a positive integer L (1  L  50), which is the number of subsequent lines.
Each of the following L lines contains an alphabet.

An alphabet is a contiguous sequence of b distinct symbols, where 2  b  100.
A symbol is a printable character.

```

## Output

```
For each input alphabet, the output is the sequence of all autobiographical numbers in increasing order.
Each number is written on a different line.

The outputs of two consecutive alphabets are separated by a blank line.
