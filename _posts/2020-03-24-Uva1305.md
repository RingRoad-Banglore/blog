## Input

```text

In 2100, ACM chocolate will be one of the favorite foods in the world.
Green, orange, brown, red . . ., colorful sugar-coated shell maybe is the most attractive feature of

ACM chocolate. How many colors have you ever seen? Nowadays, its said that the ACM chooses from
a palette of twenty-four colors to paint their delicious candy bits.

One day, Sandy played a game on a big package of ACM chocolates which contains five colors (green,
orange, brown, red and yellow). Each time he took one chocolate from the package and placed it on
the table. If there were two chocolates of the same color on the table, he ate both of them. He found
a quite interesting thing that in most of the time there were always 2 or 3 chocolates on the table.

Now, here comes the problem, if there are C colors of ACM chocolates in the package (colors are
distributed evenly), after N chocolates are taken from the package, whats the probability that there is
exactly M chocolates on the table? Would you please write a program to figure it out?
