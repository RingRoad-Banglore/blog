title: Uva 11542  Square
---


## Input

```text

Given n integers you can generate 2n1 non-empty subsets from them. Determine for how many of these
subsets the product of all the integers in that is a perfect square. For example for the set {4,6,10,15}
there are 3 such subsets. {4}, {6,10,15} and {4,6,10,15}. A perfect square is an integer whose square
root is an integer. For example 1, 4, 9, 16, . . . .
```

## Output

```text
Input contains multiple test cases. First line of the input contains T (1  T  30) the number of test
cases. Each test case consists of 2 lines. First line contains n (1  n  100) and second line contains n
space separated integers. All these integers are between 1 and 1015. None of these integers is divisible
by a prime greater than 500.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output is a single line containing one integer denoting the number of non-empty
subsets whose integer product is a perfect square. The input will be such that the result will always fit
into signed 64 bit integer.
