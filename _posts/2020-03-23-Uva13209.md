13209 My Password is a Palindromic Prime Number
Gauss’ is a clever guy who is a little obsessed with information security, that’s why he is always looking
for the most secure password. After a long research Gauss is choosing for his password a palindromic
prime number ppm, which is ultra secure, the only problem is that he always forgets it. As a help to
his bad memory, Gauss wants to write a file with the decimal number produced by the division of one
(1) and his password, 1/ppm. Gauss knows that the result is always a pure recurring (periodic) decimal
number, and therefore he only wants to save the number with its period. For example:

Gauss’ Password Decimal Number 1/PPM Length
(PPM) 1/PPM

Having the file, Gauss knows that he can execute an algorithm to remember his password. Can you
help Gauss to write the file?

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer t, the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each line
contains a palindromic prime number n (10 < n < 105).

## Output
For each test case print the pure recurring decimal number that will help Gauss to remember his
password. (Use ‘.’ as a decimal point)

## Sample Input
