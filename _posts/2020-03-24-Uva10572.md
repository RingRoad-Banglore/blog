```
Given a partially filled grid with M rows and N columns, you are to calculate how many ways there
are to fill the remaining part of the grid under the constraints stated below, and output one of these
ways (if any exist).

Each cell in the grid should be colored either black or white. All black cells in the grid should be
connected with each other, and all white cells should also be connected with each other. The pictures
below show two filled grids where this constraint is only fulfilled in the right picture.

Furthermore, there must be no 22 blocks in the grid which consists of only white cells, or of only
black cells. The picture below to the left shows a grid with a black and a white 22 block, while the
grid below to the right contains no such 22 block.

You are not allowed to change the color of any of the cells whose color has already been assigned in
the input, and all cells must be colored
```

## Input

```
The first line in the input contains an integer T (less than 100), the number of cases to follow. Each
case starts with two integers, M and N (2  M,N  8), the number of rows and columns respectively
in the grid. The next M lines contains N characters each and describes the grid using the following
characters:

# - a cell which is colored black

o - a cell which is colored white

. - a cell which color has not yet been assigned

```

## Output

```
For each case, first output the number of ways to fill the grid. If there are at least one way, you should
also output one of these ways, using the same format for the grid as in the input. Output a blank line
after each case.
