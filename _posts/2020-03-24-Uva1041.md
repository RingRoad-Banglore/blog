Preston Digitation is a magician who specializes in card tricks. One thing Preston cannot get just right
is perfect in-shuffles. A perfect in-shuffle is one where a deck of 52 cards is divided in half and then
the two halves are perfectly interleaved so that the top card of the lower half of the deck becomes the
top card of the shuffled deck. If we number the cards 0 (top) to 51 (bottom), the resulting deck after
a perfect in-shuffle will look like the following:

26 0 27 1 28 2 29 3 30 4 31 5 32 6  51 25

Preston finds that he makes at most one mistake per shuffle. For example, cards 2 and 28 might end
up interchanged, resulting in a shuffled deck that looks like this:

26 0 27 1 2 28 29 3 30 4 31 5 32 6  51 25

These exchanges of two adjacent cards are the only mistakes Preston makes. After one shuffle, it is easy
for him to see if and where he has made a mistake, but after several shuffles this becomes increasingly
difficult. He would like you to write a program that can determine his mistakes (if any).
```

## Input

```
Input will consist of multiple problem instances. The first line will be a single integer indicating the
number of problem instances. Each problem instance will consist of a single line containing the cards
of a deck which has been shuffled between 1 and 10 times. All decks will be of size 52.

Note: The sample input below shows multiple lines for a problem instance. The actual input data for
a problem instance is contained on a single line.

```

## Output

```
For each problem instance, output the case number (starting at 1), followed by the number of shuffles
that were used for that instance. If there were no mistakes made during the shuffling, output the line

No error in any shuffle

Otherwise, output a set of lines of the form

Error in shuffle n at location m

where n is a shuffle where an error occurred and m is the location of the error. Shuffles are numbered
starting with 1 and the location value should indicate the first location of the two cards that were
swapped in that shuffle (where the top of the deck is position 0). In the example described above, the
cards in positions 4 and 5 (the cards numbered 2 and 28) are incorrect, so m would be 4 in this case.
List all errors in order of increasing n. If one or more shuffles have no errors, do not print any line for
them. If there are multiple solutions, pick the solution with the fewest number of errors. I there are
still several solutions, pick the lexicographically first (regarding the error positions).

Print a blank line after each dataset.
