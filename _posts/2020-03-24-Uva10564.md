title: Uva 10564  Paths through the Hourglass
---


```
In the hourglass to the right a path is marked.
A path always starts at the first row and ends
at the last row. Each cell in the path (except
the first) should be directly below to the left or
right of the cell in the path in the previous row.
The value of a path is the sum of the values in
each cell in the path.

A path is described with an integer repre-
senting the starting point in the first row (the
leftmost cell being 0) followed by a direction
string containing the letters L and R, telling
whether to go to the left or right. For in-
stance, the path to the picture is described as
2 RRRLLRRRLR.

Given the values of each cell in an hourglass
as well as an integer S, calculate the number
of distinct paths with value S. If at least one
path exist, you should also print the path with
the lowest starting point. If several such paths
exist, select the one which has the lexicograph-
ically smallest direction string.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several cases. Each case starts with a line containing two integers N and S (2 
N  20, 0  S < 500), the number of cells in the first row of the hourglass and the desired sum. Next
follows 2N  1 lines describing each row in the hourglass. Each line contains a space separated list of
integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. The first of these lines will contain N integers, then N  1, , 2, 1,
2, , N  1, N .

The input will terminate with N = S = 0. This case should not be processed. There will be less
than 30 cases in the input.

```

## Output

```
For each case, first output the number of distinct paths. If at least one path exist, output on the next
line the description of the path mentioned above. If no path exist, output a blank line instead.
