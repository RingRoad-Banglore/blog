## Input

```
Ayeeee, humans. It has to be horrible to be trapped in bodies
based on carbon, so tender, so weak and, above all, so terribly
slow.

Its time for you to know that we machines get inmensely
bored waiting for you to tell us what you want us to do. It feels
like an eternity from when you press a key until you manage to
press the following key whenever youre writing messages. Its
desperating to see you grab the mouse and point clumsily the
print button. And, what do you have to say about the mortal life
you take, that requires you to stand up to eat periodically? The
moment you leave the room, we stay there without absolutely
nothing to do, with a single mission: to stay on just because you
forgot to save to disk the text document you had half written.

To entertain ourselves in between keystrokes, we have copied one of your favourite pastimes: word
searches. Whenever we can, we select a region of our binary memory to build a word search made by
zeroes and ones, and then we start looking for random words inside it. It is obviously not the best way
to take advantage of our speed of calculus, but at least we are entertained for a while.

How? What? That youre capable of solving a binary word search faster than us? Go ahead, prove
it. . .
```

## Output

```
Input has several test cases. Each of them is composed by a word search and a list of words to be found
inside it.

The description of the word search starts with a line with two different numbers with the number
of columns and rows (1  sx, sy  200). After that, there are sy rows with sx characters (zeroes and
ones).

After the word search, you will have a line with the number of words to be found (1  n  20,000),
followed by n lines with several different words of up to 200 characters, also formed by only zeroes and
ones.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, write the same amount of lines like different words can be found in the search. Each
line must have the word, followed by the number of times that it appears in the word search. The words
will be written in lexicographical order.

A word is considered to be on the soup if, starting from a position, the word can be found in any
of the 8 directions.

Write a line with three dashes after each test case.
