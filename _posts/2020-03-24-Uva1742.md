A large part of the world economy depends on oil, which is why research into new methods for finding
and extracting oil is still active. Profits of oil companies depend in part on how efficiently they can
drill for oil. The International Crude Petroleum Consortium (ICPC) hopes that extensive computer
simulations will make it easier to determine how to drill oil wells in the best possible way.

Drilling oil wells optimally is getting harder each day  the newly discovered oil deposits often do
not form a single body, but are split into many parts. The ICPC is currently concerned with stratified
deposits, as illustrated in Figure G.1.

Figure G.1: Oil layers buried in the earth. This figure corresponds to Sample Input 1.

To simplify its analysis, the ICPC considers only the 2-dimensional case, where oil deposits are
modeled as horizontal line segments parallel to the earths surface. The ICPC wants to know how to
place a single oil well to extract the maximum amount of oil. The oil well is drilled from the surface
along a straight line and can extract oil from all deposits that it intersects on its way down, even if the
intersection is at an endpoint of a deposit. One such well is shown as a dashed line in Figure G.1, hitting
three deposits. In this simple model the amount of oil contained in a deposit is equal to the width of
the deposit. Can you help the ICPC determine the maximum amount of oil that can be extracted by
a single well?
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several test cases, each of them as described below.

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1  n  2000), which is the number of oil
deposits. This is followed by n lines, each describing a single deposit. These lines contain three integers
x0, x1, and y giving the deposits position as the line segment with endpoints (x0, y) and (x1, y). These
numbers satisfy |x0|, |x1|  106 and 1  y  106. No two deposits will intersect, not even at a point.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, display the maximum amount of oil that can be extracted by a single oil well on a
line by itself.
