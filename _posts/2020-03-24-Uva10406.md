title: Uva 10406  Cutting tabletops
---


## Input

```
Bever Lumber hires beavers to cut wood. The company has re-
cently received a shippment of tabletops. Each tabletop is a con-
vex polygon. However, in this hard economic times of cutting
costs the company has ordered the tabletops from a not very re-
spectable but cheap supplier. Some of the tabletops have the right
shape but they are slightly too big. The beavers have to chomp
of a strip of wood of a fixed width from each edge of the tabletop
such that they get a tabletop of a similar shape but smaller. Your
task is to find the area of the tabletop after beavers are done.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of a number of cases each presented on a separate
line. Each line consists of a sequence of numbers. The first num-
ber is d the width of the strip of wood to be cut off of each edge
of the tabletop in centimeters. The next number n is an integer
giving the number of vertices of the polygon. The next n pairs
of numbers present xi and yi coordinates of polygon vertices for
1  i  n given in clockwise order. A line containing only two zeroes terminate the input.

d is much smaller than any of the sides of the polygon. The beavers cut the edges one after another
and after each cut the number of vertices of the tabletop is the same.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input produce one line of output containing one number to three decimal digits in the
fraction giving the area of the tabletop after cutting.
