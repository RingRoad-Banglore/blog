title: Uva 11465  Count the Polygons
---


## Input

```text

A polygon is a plane figure that is bounded by a closed path and composed of a finite sequence of
straight line segments. These segments are called its edges, and the points where two edges meet are
the polygons vertices.

You have got a set of N sticks of various lengths. How many ways can you choose K sticks from
this set and form a polygon with K sides by joining the end points.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of input is an integer T (T < 100) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
starts with a line containing 2 positive integers N and K (3  N  30 & 3  K  N). The next line
contains N positive integers in the range [1, 231), which represents the lengths of the available sticks.
The integers are separated by a single space.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output the case number followed by the number of valid polygons that can be formed by
picking K sticks from the given N sticks.
