## Input

```
Welcome to the world of mice. All mice have IDs. They are numbered orderly according to their
seniority from 1. These mice live in groups. Mice of a same group have continuous ids. Mini, the mice
captain (ID 0) has called mice of specific group(IDs a to b) for a session. He wanted to make a circle
formation with those mice.

But mice have a property: The Degree of quarrel. When 2 mice are near they quarrel to an extent
that is proportional to the difference in the number of factors of their individual ids. For example when
2 mice of ids 4 and 24 are near they quarrel 5 units(say). Number of factors of 4  3(1,2,4). 24  8
(1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24).

Also the strength of quarrel affects the neighbourhood. So, Mini, the mice captain wants to minimize
the strength of the maximum quarrel in that circle by arranging the mice appropriately. Note that the
circle formation is mandatory. Help Mini, the mice caption to MiniMice the quarrel.
```

## Output

```
First line contains number of test cases.

Each test case is represented by a space separated list of 2 ids representing the group of mice a b.
All mice with ids a  id  b are present in the session. 1  a  4999999; a < b  5000000.

```

## Sample Input

```
Output one line for each test case, the minimized maximum quarrel value. Quarrel value between 2
mice = Absolute Difference in Number of factors of their IDs.

Explanation:

Case 1:
ID - No. of factors
5 - 2
6 - 4
7 - 2
8 - 4
5-6-7-8-5 is a good arrangement. 4-2 = 2.

Case 2:
ID - No. of factors
21 - 4
22 - 4
23 - 2
24 - 8
24-21-23-22-24 is a good arrangement. 8-4 = 4.

```

## Sample Output

```
2
5 8
21 24
