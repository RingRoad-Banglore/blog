title: Uva 01168  PresterJohn

## Input

```
Where was the Kingdom of Prester John? There are many maps showing the way to it, but unfortu-
nately it seems hard to establish a sensible agreement. India? Ethiopia? Mongolia? Syria? Puzzling
. . . Well, what would one expect from the descendant of the Three Wise Men?

An idea is to follow the directions in two maps at the same time, and if the directions lead to the
same place, we can find Prester. Well, information technology may help here. Write a program that,
given two medieval maps of the world indicating the location of the Mythical Kingdom, finds the length
of the common shortest path to the location where the Prester was seen.

Given two maps, compute the minimumlength of a common path to the Prester location.
```

## Output

```
Input consists of multiple test cases, each of them as described below. The first line of the input contains
the number of test cases.

There is a blank line before each dataset.
The input contains the description of a pair of maps, in sequence. Each map is given by a positive

integer L, not greater than 50,000, in a single line, indicating the number of locations in the map. Next,
there is an integer in the range [0, L  1] indicating the location, in a single line, where the Prester
was seen. Next, there is a positive integer P , not greater than 100,000, in a single line, indicating the
number of paths in the description of the map. Then, the description of the map follows. Each path in
the map is listed in a separate line, and has the form

L1 description L2

where L1 and L2 are integers in the range [0, L  1] indicating a location, and description is a string
with no more than 8 characters, indicating the name of a path from location L1 to location L2. It is
known that location 0 represents the same place in all maps.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, write an integer in a single line indicating the length of the shortest sequence of path
descriptions that is common to both maps, and that, in both maps, lead to a location of the Prester.
If there is no common path leading to the Prester location, your program should write -1 as result.

Print a blank line between datasets.
