## Input

```text
There is a sequence of n+ 2 elements a0, a1, . . . , an+1 (n  3000;1000  ai  1000). It is known that

ai =
ai1 + ai+1

2
 ci

for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n. You are given a0, an+1, c1, . . . , cn. Write a program which calculates a1.
```

## Output

```text
The first line is the number of test cases, followed by a blank line.

For each test case, the first line of the input contains an integer n. The next two lines consist of
numbers a0 and an+1 each having two digits after decimal point, and the next n lines contain numbers
ci (also with two digits after decimal point), one number per line.

Each test case will be separated by a single line.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, the output should contain a1 in the same format as a0 and an+1.

Print a blank line between the outputs for two consecutive test cases.

```

## Sample Output

```text
1

1
50.50
25.50
10.15

```
