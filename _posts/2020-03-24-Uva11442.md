## Input

```text
Solving linear Diophantine equations with three variables
is not the easiest thing in the world and in this problem
you will have to do something similar to that. In this
problem we will deal with a specific Diophantine equation
1073x + 1827y + 3108z = 270396. Of course this equation
has infinite number of all integer (The values of x, y and z
are all integers) solutions, so it is pointless to ask the num-
ber of solutions. So you will have to find special type of all
integer solutions.

You will be given three different possible all integer so-
lution triples of this equation. Many other solutions can be
found by taking weighted average of any two of these integer solutions (Not necessarily these newly
found solutions are integer solutions). And these new solutions can be used with the given three solu-
tions to find many other solutions by taking weighted average of any two. Your job is to find the total
number of all integer solution triples obtainable in this way.

For example suppose the given three possible solutions are (r1x, r1y, r1z), (r2x, r2y, r2z) and
(r3x, r3y, r3z). A new solution (rx, ry, rz) can be found by taking the weighted average of first two
of these two solutions. That is

rx =
wr1x + vr2x

w + v
, ry =

wr1y + vr2y
w + v

, rz =
wr1z + vr2z

w + v

Here (w  0, v  0 and (w + v) > 0). Of course for different values of w and v many solutions can
be found and may be only a few of them are all integer solutions. All the new found solutions along
with the given three solutions can be used to find infinite number of solutions by taking the weighed
average of any two. Although such solutions are infinite in number, there are only a finite number of
all integer solutions found in this way. You are to find the total number of different all integer solutions
(triples) found.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 16001) which denotes the total number
of input sets. Each of the next N lines contains nine integers r1x, r1y, r1z, r2x, r2y, r2z, r3x, r3y, r3z.
These nine integers mean that (r1x, r1y, r1z), (r2x, r2y, r2z) and (r3x, r3y, r3z) are three possible all
integer solutions of the Diophantine equation 1073x+ 1827y + 3108z = 270396.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains an integer T which denotes the
total number of all integer solutions that can be obtained by taking weighted average of the given three
all integer solutions and the subsequent solutions (not necessarily all integer).
