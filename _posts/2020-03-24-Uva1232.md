Skyline of Singapore at Night

The skyline of Singapore as viewed from
the Marina Promenade (shown on the
left) is one of the iconic scenes of Singa-
pore. Country X would also like to cre-
ate an iconic skyline, and it has put up
a call for proposals. Each submitted pro-
posal is a description of a proposed sky-
line and one of the metrics that country
X will use to evaluate a proposed skyline
is the amount of overlap in the proposed
sky-line.

As the assistant to the chair of
the skyline evaluation committee, you
have been tasked with determining the
amount of overlap in each proposal.
Each proposal is a sequence of buildings,
b1, b2, . . . , bn, where a building is specified by its left and right endpoint and its height. The buildings
are specified in back to front order, in other words a building which appears later in the sequence
appears in front of a building which appears earlier in the sequence.

The skyline formed by the first k buildings is the union of the rectangles of the first k buildings
(see Figure 4). The overlap of a building, bi, is defined as the total horizontal length of the parts of bi,
whose height is greater than or equal to the skyline behind it. This is equivalent to the total horizontal
length of parts of the skyline behind bi which has a height that is less than or equal to hi, where hi is
the height of building bi. You may assume that initially the skyline has height zero everywhere.

## Output

```text
The input consists of a line containing the number c of datasets, followed by c datasets, followed by a
line containing the number 0.

The first line of each dataset consists of a single positive integer, n (0 < n < 100000), which is the
number of buildings in the proposal. The following n lines of each dataset each contains a description
of a single building. The i-th line is a description of building bi. Each building bi is described by three
positive integers, separated by spaces, namely, li, ri and hi, where li and rj (0 < li < ri  100000)
represents the left and right end point of the building and hi (0 < hi  109) represents the height of
the building.

```

## Sample Input

```text
The output consists of one line for each dataset. The c-th line contains one single integer, representing
the amount of overlap in the proposal for dataset c. You may assume that the amount of overlap for
each dataset is at most 2000000.

Note: In the sample test case, the overlap of building b1, b2 and b3 are 6, 4 and 4 respectively. Figure
4 shows how to compute the overlap of building b3. The grey area represents the skyline formed by b1
and b2 and the black rectangle represents b3. As shown in the figure, the length of the skyline covered
by b3 is from position 3 to position 5 and from position 11 to position 13, therefore the overlap of b3 is 4.
