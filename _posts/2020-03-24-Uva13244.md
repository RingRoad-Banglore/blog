## Input

```
Happines is the certainty of not feeling lost.

Jorge Bucay

Bhutan is the only country in the world that has an indicator called Gross Interior Happiness,
which measures the quality of life of the population.

Now, they want to send a space rocket to Mars to measure the happiness of potential inhabitants
of Mars.

The rocket to Mars increases its speed from 0 to the maximum speed. At this point, it starts to
decelerate gradually from maximum speed to 0, instant at which it lands. But the budget to build the
rocket is low. It has a speedometer that only detects odd speeds.

An example of the speed changes is: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 0. The cost of moving from speed i
to j is j million ngultrums, which is the currency in Bhutan.

Bhutan space agency wants to know the total cost of sending the rocket to Mars.

## Output

```
The first line of the input contains an integer, t, indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case, there is a line with an odd number, s, with 1  s  109 + 1, indicating the
maximum speed reached by the rocket.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, the output should consist of one line showing the total cost of sending the rocket to
Mars, in millions ngultrums.
