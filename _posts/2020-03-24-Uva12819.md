title: Uva 12819  Block Toy
---


```

There is a rectangular board, we want to build a toy by piling some unit blocks onto it. The toy can
be described by the following height matrix, which means we need 4 unit blocks in the middle, and
1 unit block at other positions.

1 1 1

1 4 1

1 1 1

We have an unlimited supply of 1  1 and 1  2 blocks, so we can build the toys in various ways.
For example (letters are unit blocks, unit blocks with same letter belongs to the same 1 2 block):

If at least one 1 1 blocks is used we say its a silver toy, otherwise we say its a gold toy.
Given the height matrix, find out the number of silver toys and gold toys we can build.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each test case begins with two positive integers R, C (1 
R C  16), the number of rows and columns. Each of the following R lines contains C integers h(i, j).
(0  h(i, j)  20).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number, the number of silver toys and the number of gold toys, both
modulo 109 + 7.
