title: Uva 11343  Isolated Segments
---


## Input

```
Youre given n segments in the rectangular coordinate system. The segments are defined by start and
end points (Xi, Yi) and (Xj , Yj) (1  i, j  n). Coordinates of these points are integer numbers with
real value smaller then 1000. Length of each segment is positive.

When 2 segments dont have a common point then it is said that segments dont collide. In any
other case segments collide. Be aware that segments collide even if they have only one point in common.

Segment is said to be isolated if it doesnt collide with all the other segments that are given, i.e.
segment i is isolated when for each 1  j  n, (i = j), segments i and j dont collide. You are asked
to find number T  how many segments are isolated.
```

## Output

```
First line of input contains number N (N  50), then tests follow. First line of each test case contains
number M (M  100)  the number of segments for this test case to be considered. For this particular
test case M lines follow each containing a description of one segment. Segment is described by 2 points:
start point (Xpi, Ypi) and end point (Xei, Yei). They are given in such order: Xpi Ypi Xei Yei

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output one line containing number T .
