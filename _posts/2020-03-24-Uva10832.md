```
Three years ago, Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems, Inc., of the planet Tau Ceti Prime, received a generous
contract from the Department of Stellar Defense (DoSD) to provide the StarBlazers Forces with their
next-generation engines. These engines are primarily to be used for ferrying large cargos of supplies to
several outposts in the outer rim.

These engines have special properties. First of all, they only have two speeds: zero and really-really-
fast. Secondly, they do not require any time to go from one speed to the other; They can instantly go
from zero to really-really-fast, and vice-versa.

In order to receive continued funding, Yoyodyne must provide the DoSD with a demonstration that
they have made significant progress towards developing these engines (Its always the same old story
with government funding, isnt it?!?!). To do this, the DoSD has set up a series of buoys in a remote
part of the galaxy, and tasked Yoyodyne with navigating each sequence of buoys given a certain amount
of fuel at the start of each sequence. The engines would keep traveling until the last bouy is reached
or it runs out of fuel, whichever occurs first. We would assume that the fuel consumtion is uniform
throughout the travel.

Assume that each mission starts at location (0,0,1). At the start of each mission, and as each buoy
is reached, the next buoy to visit is determined by the closest buoy in the mission that has not yet been
visited. In case of a tie, the buoy information that comes first in the input is given preference. Your job
is to write a program to check if the current prototype engines can successfully complete each mission,
given certain mission parameters, and provide some statistics about engine performance.
```

## Input

```
The input to this problem consists of maximum 10 missions.

The first line of each mission consists four of integers. The first integer, f (1  f  20, 000), is the
amount of fuel (in kernels) in the tanks at the start of the mission, the next number, b (1  b  100)
is the burn-rate of the fuel in kernels per second, the third number, r (1  r  200) defines how fast
really-really-fast is for this mission, in lightyears per second and the fourth integer n (1  n  20)
denotes the number of buoys in the mission. Each of the next n lines contains three integers x, y, z
(2000  x, y, z  2000) defining the (x, y, z) coordinates, in lightyears, of one buoys in this mission.
The coordinates can range from -2000 to 2000 inclusive. If two buoys have the same coordinate they
should be considered as two different buoys, although the distance between them is zero.

The end of input is signified by a line where f = b = r = n = 0.

```

## Output

```
You are to output one line for each mission. The output line begins with the word Mission followed
by a space, the mission number, a colon, and a space. If the mission can be completed, you are to
output the word SUCCESS!!, followed by a space, the word Time:, a space, the total amount of time
to complete the mission, in seconds, followed by two spaces, the word Traveled:, a space, the total
distance traveled for this mission, in lightyears, followed by two spaces, the words Fuel Left:, a
space, and the amount of fuel left in the tanks, in kernels.

If the mission cannot be completed, you are to output the word FAILURE!!, followed by a space,
the word Traveled:, a space, the total distance traveled for this mission, in lightyears, followed by
two spaces, the words From Home:, a space, the distance from the current location to the final buoy,
in lightyears, assuming you would traverse all remaining legs of the mission. All numbers in the output
(Except the serial of mission) should be rounded to two digits after the decimal point.
