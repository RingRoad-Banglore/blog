title: Uva 11073  Eulers Totient Function
---


```
As you might know, Eulers totient function (n) is defined as the number of positive integers a, a  n
that are relatively prime to n. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is
1. If the prime factorization of n = pe11 p

e2
2 . . . p

ej
j is known the value of (n) can be calculated via the

following formula:


j
i=1(pi  1)p

i

Now your task is to calculate the positive integers n which fulfill the equation (n) = x for a given
x.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of a number of lines. On each line there is a single positve integer with no leading
zeros. There are no spaces in the input. All numbers will be positive integers smaller than 1000000000.

```

## Output

```
For each line of input there should be one line of output. If the equation (n) = x has a solution,
print all its solutions on a single line. The solutions should be printed in ascending order and should
be seperated by a space. If there is no solution to the equation, print: No solution.
