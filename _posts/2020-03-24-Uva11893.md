title: Uva 11893  Fabulous DAGy
---


```
Little poopi had something strange that was called DAGy. poopi liked DAGy so much, but when he
showed DAGy to other children they scared and ran away! DAGy is not a pet or a toy; it is a special
kind of graph! DAGy is made up of a directed acyclic graph plus one additional directed edge. With
this additional edge a cycle forms that goes through every vertex in the graph.

Once when poopi was playing with DAGy, it fell out of his hands and became totally deformed. He
cried and cried. He denied new graphs because he wanted his own DAGy.

It is said that computer programmers are supermen, because they can solve problems that nobody
else is able to even approach. You, the computer programmer! Help little poopi and dispose his DAGy
again!
```

## Input

```
In the first line there is an integer T (T  40), the number of tests. You are given N and M (1  N 
400) in the first line of each test, which are the number of vertices and the number of edges respectively.
Next M pairs of integers u, v (0  u, v < N) meaning that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex
v. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices. It is guaranteed that each input graph is a
directed acyclic graph with one additional edge between two distinct vertices of graph.

```

## Output

```
DAGy can be put back in order if you find the maximal cycle that goes through every vertex. If you
found such a cycle print Yeah, I'm superman in a single line. Otherwise print Your DAGy was
initially defected! (Quotes for clarity) You are superman trying to help little poopi anyway!
