title: Uva 10460  Find the Permuted String
---


## Input

```
Permutation of a given string can be done in different ways. In order to get different permutations of
a string, when all characters in the string are different, Donald E. Knuth gave the following process.

To get all the permutations of a n character string (a1a2 . . . an), using each permutation a1a2 . . . an1,
we can form n others by inserting an (n-th character) in all possible places. Thus we get n! permutations
of that string.

For example, to generate all permutations of ACB, we first start with A, then insert C and then
insert B.

Col 1 Col 2 Col3 Permutation Index
A CA BCA 1

CBA 2
CAB 3

AC CBA 4
ABC 5
ACB 6

So we see that using above technique, the permutations of ACB are generated in a particular order.
Here 2nd permutation of ACB is the string CBA or permutation index of CBA is 2. In this problem
you will be given a string and a permutation index, I. You have to find the Ith permutation of the
given string.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input file will contain an integer denoting the number of test cases to follow. For each
test case there will be two lines. First line of each test case will contain a string of length less than
or equal to 26. The characters of the string will be all upper case letters and different. Next line will
contain a permutation index, I. Range of I is from 1 to min(n!, 231  1), where n is the length of the
string.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the Ith permuted string of the given string in a line. Look at Sample input
and output for details.
