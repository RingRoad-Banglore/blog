title: Uva 12041  BFS Binary Fibonacci String
---


## Input

```
We are familiar with the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...). What if we define a similar sequence
for strings? Sounds interesting? Lets see.

We define the follwing sequence:

BFS(0) = 0 BFS(1) = 1 (here 0 and 1 are strings, not simply the numerical digit, 0 or 1)

for all (n > 1) BFS(n) = BFS(n  2) + BFS(n  1) (here, + denotes the string concatenation
operation). (i.e. the n-th string in this sequence is a concatenation of a previous two strings).

So, the first few strings of this sequence are: 0, 1, 01, 101, 01101, and so on.
Your task is to find the N -th string of the sequence and print all of its characters from the i-th to

j-th position, inclusive. (All of N , i, j are 0-based indices)
```

## Output

```
The first line of the input file contains an integer T (T  100) which denotes the total number of test
cases. The description of each test case is given below:

Three integers N , i, j (0  N, i, j  231  1) and (i  j and j  i  10000). You can assume that,
both i and j will be valid indices (i.e. 0  i, j < length of BFS(N)).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the substring from the i-th to the j-th position of BFS(N) in a single line.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
3 1 2
1 0 0
9 5 12

```
