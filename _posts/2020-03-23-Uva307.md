307 Sticks
George took sticks of the same length and cut them randomly until all parts became at most 50 units
long. Now he wants to return sticks to the original state, but he forgot how many sticks he had originally
and how long they were originally. Please help him and design a program which computes the smallest
possible original length of those sticks. All lengths expressed in units are integers greater than zero.

## Input
The input file contains blocks of 2 lines. The first line contains the number of sticks parts after cutting.
The second line contains the lengths of those parts separated by the space. The last line of the file
contains ‘0’.

## Output
The output file contains the smallest possible length of original sticks, one per line.

## Sample Input
<p>9</p><p>5 2 1 5 2 1 5 2 1</p><p>4</p><p>1 2 3 4</p><p>0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>6</p><p>5</p>
