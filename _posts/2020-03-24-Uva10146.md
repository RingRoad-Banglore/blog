## Input

```text
Authors of the new, all-in-one encyclopedia have organized the titles in the order they consider most
appropriate for their readers. Its not always alphabetical, because they want to observe some peculiar
relationships between them. However, they still want to allow users to look up titles quickly.

They achieve this by adding a carefully calculated number of spaces before every title in the list of
titles. They call this structure a dictionary.

A dictionary is represented by a list of words with some number of spaces before certain words.
Dictionary format can be described as a set of constraints on sequences of consecutive words starting
with the same letter. Any maximal sequence of consecutive words starting with the same letter should
satisfy the following rules:

 The first word in the group has no spaces before it. Every subsequent word in the group has at
least one leading space.

 If

 the first word of the group is deleted and

 one space is deleted before every remaining word and

 the first letter is deleted from every remaining word

then resulting sequence is a dictionary.

The authors dont feel like giving you a more detailed explanation of what a dictionary is, so they
have included an example (see sample input and output) that clarifies their definition.

Your task is to write a program that will convert a given list of words into a dictionary by adding
some number of spaces before certain words and preserving the original order of the words.
```

## Output

```text
The first line of the input contains an integer indicating the number of test cases in the input. Then
there is a blank line and the test cases separated by a blank line.

Each test case consists of at least one and most 100000 words. Each word consists of at least one
and at most 10 lower-case letters. There will be no leading or trailing spaces. There will be no blank
lines between the words.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case write to the output file the original words in the same order without any trailing
spaces but with the appropriate number of leading spaces, so that this word list is a dictionary. There
should be no blank lines between the words.

Print a blank line between test cases.

NOTE: In the Sample Output, for reading convenience, spaces are replaced with . characters. Your
output file should contain spaces instead.
