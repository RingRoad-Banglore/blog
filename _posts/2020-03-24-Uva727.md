```
Write a program that changes an infix expression to a postfix expression according to the following
specifications.
```

## Input

```
1. The infix expression to be converted is in the input file in the format of one character per line,

with a maximum of 50 lines in the file. For example, (3+2)*5 would be in the form:

(
3
+
2
)
*
5

2. The input starts with an integer on a line by itself indicating the number of test cases. Several
infix expressions follows, preceded by a blank line.

3. The program will only be designed to handle the binary operators +, -, *, /.

4. The operands will be one digit numerals.

5. The operators * and / have the highest priority. The operators + and - have the lowest priority.
Operators at the same precedence level associate from left to right. Parentheses act as grouping
symbols that over-ride the operator priorities.

6. Each testcase will be an expression with valid syntax.

```

## Output

```
The output file will have each postfix expression all on one line. Print a blank line between different
expressions.

```

## Sample Input

```
1

(
3
+
2
)
*
5

```

## Sample Output

```
32+5*
```
