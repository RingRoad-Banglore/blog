title: Uva 10453  Make Palindrome
---


```
By definition palindrome is a string which is not changed when reversed. MADAM is a nice example of
palindrome. It is an easy job to test whether a given string is a palindrome or not. But it may not be
so easy to generate a palindrome.

Here we will make a palindrome generator which will take an input string and return a palindrome.
You can easily verify that for a string of length n, no more than (n1) characters are required to make
it a palindrome. Consider abcd and its palindrome abcdcba or abc and its palindrome abcba.

But life is not so easy for programmers!! We always want optimal cost.
And you have to find the minimum number of characters required to make a given string to a

palindrome if you are allowed to insert characters at any position of the string.
```

## Input

```
Each input line consists only of lower case letters. The size of input string will be at most 1000. Input
is terminated by EOF.

```

## Output

```
For each input print the minimum number of characters and such a palindrome separated by one space
in a line. There may be many such palindromes. Any one will be accepted.

```

## Sample Input

```
abcd
aaaa
abc
aab
abababaabababa
pqrsabcdpqrs

```

## Sample Output

```
3 abcdcba
0 aaaa
2 abcba
1 baab
0 abababaabababa
9 pqrsabcdpqrqpdcbasrqp
```
