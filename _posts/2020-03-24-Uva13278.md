## Input

```text
Angry Birds Transformers is a side-scrolling shoot em up video game, the tenth installment in the
Angry Birds series, a crossover between Angry Birds and Transformers, featuring battles between the
Autobirds and Deceptihogs, Angry Birds versions of the Autobots and Decepticons. It is published by
Rovio Entertainment with collaboration from Hasbro. [From Wikipedia] Six consecutive screenshots
from  this  game  are  shown  below:

As you can see that as the player moves from left to right he can see new objects and can try to
destroy them. Given the location of all the objects you will have to find out the maximum number of
objects  that  are  visible  at  any  point  of  the  game  by  the  player.

For  simplicity  you  can  assume  the  following  things:

1. All  objects  can  be  considered  as  points  in  a  two  dimensional  Cartesian  coordinate  system.

2. The  player  runs  along  the  x  axis  from  left  to  right.

3. The viewing angle of the eye of the player is 90 degree and symmetric along the straight line
x = px ,  where  px   is  the  abscissa  of  the  player  location.

The  following  image  will  make  things  clear:

The goal is to find the maximum number of objects that can be seen at a time if the player moves
along the x-axis.  You can assume that if two or more objects and the location of the player
are collinear, the player can still see all the objects. There is no need to find the location from
where the maximum number of objects are visible as there can be more than one such place. The image
above  corresponds  to  the  sample  input.

## Output

```text
Input file contains at most  100 sets of inputs. Each set starts with a positive integer  N (N  10000)
denoting the total number of objects present in the scenario. Each of the next  N lines contains two
integers (xi, yi) , denoting the Cartesian coordinate of the  i-th  object. Here (0 < xi  10000 and
0 < yi  500). 

 Input  is  terminated  by  a  line  containing  a  single  zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of inputs, produce one line of output. This line contains an integer that denotes the
maximum  number  of  objects  visible  by  a  player  while  running  along  the  x-axis.
