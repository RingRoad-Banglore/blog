title: Uva 13038  Directed Forest
---


## Input

```
In this problem, you will be given a directed forest... wait what? A directed forest? Does that even
exist?

Well, here in programming world, everything is possible. So let me describe what is meant by a
directed forest first. A directed forest is just a set of one or more directed trees, and, a directed tree is
just like a normal tree, except the edges are directed. Oh well, we call that a DAG (Directed Acyclic
Graph), youd say, but, Im not sure if both are same. But I can say this, a directed tree is a DAG
whose underlying undirected graph is a tree.

Now, come back to what I was saying earlier, you will be given a directed forest, and you have to
make sets of nodes. But there is a restriction, if node A is an ancestor of node B in the given forest,
then A and B cannot be in the same set. If you do not know what is an ancestor, if there is a directed
path from node A to B, then A is the ancestor of B. Can you find out what would be the minimum
number of such sets to contain all of the nodes?
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T (T  100), the number of test cases. For each case, there will be two
integers N and E, the number of nodes and number of edges respectively. Nodes are numbered from 1
to N . Then, there are E pairs of integers (u, v), each denoting a directed edge from u to v. Here you
can assume, 1  N  105, 0  E < N , and 1  u, v  N .

There is a blank line before every case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, first print a line of the format Case X: Y , without the quotes of course, where X
is the test case number starting from 1, and Y is the required answer. Please check sample input and
output for more details.
