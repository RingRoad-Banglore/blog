```
Now that the Loonie is hovering about par with
the Greenback, you have decided to use your
$1000 (canadian dollars) entrance scholarship
to engage in currency speculation. So you gaze
into a crystal ball which predicts the closing
exchange rate between Canadian and U.S. dol-
lars for each of the next several days. On any
given day, you can switch some or all of your
money from Canadian to U.S. dollars, or vice
versa, at the prevailing exchange rate, less a 3%
commission, less any fraction of a cent.

Assuming your crystal ball is correct, whats
the maximum amount of money you can have,
in Canadian dollars, when youre done?
```

## Input

```
The input contains a number of test cases, fol-
lowed by a line containing 0. Each test case
begins with 0 < d  365, the number of days that your crystal ball can predict. d lines follow, giving
the price of a U.S. dollar in Canadian dollars.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line giving the maximum amount of money, in Canadian dollars and cents,
that it is possible to have at the end of the last prediction, assuming you may exchange money on any
subset of the predicted days, in order.
