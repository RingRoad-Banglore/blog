## Input

```

John is moving to the penthouse of a tall sky-scraper. He packed all
his stuff in boxes and drove them to the entrance of the building on
the ground floor. Unfortunately the elevator is out of order, so the
boxes have to be moved up the stairs.

Luckily John has a lot of friends that want to help carrying his
boxes up. They all walk the stairway at the same speed of 1 floor per
minute, regardless of whether they carry a box or not. The stairway
however is so narrow that two persons cant pass each other on it.
Therefore they deciced to do the following: someone with a box in
his hands is always moving up and someone empty-handed is always
moving down. When two persons meet each other somewhere on the
stairway, the lower one (with a box) hands it over to the higher one
(without a box). (And then the lower one walks down again and the
higher one walks up.) The box exchange is instantaneous. When
someone is back on the ground floor, he picks up a box and starts
walking up. When someone is at the penthouse, he drops the box
and walks down again.

After a while the persons are scattered across the stairway, some
of them with boxes in their hands and some without. There are still
a number of boxes on the ground floor and John is wondering how much more time it will take before
all the boxes are up. Help him to find out!

## Output

```
One line with a positive number: the number of test cases. Then for each test case:

 One line with three numbers N , F , B with 1  N ,F  1000 and 1  B  1000000 : the number
of persons, the number of floors (0=ground floor, F=penthouse) and the number of boxes that
are still on the ground floor.

 N lines with two numbers fi and bi with 0  fi  F and bi = 0 or bi = 1 : the floors where the
persons are initially and whether or not they have a box in their hands (1=box, 0=no box).

```
