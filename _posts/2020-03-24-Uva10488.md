title: Uva 10488  Swimming Gopher
---


## Input

```
A gopher lives in the flatlands of Northern Saskatchewan and
travels frequently to see his cousins. After years and years of
drought, there was a period of unusually heavy rains which re-
sulted in all the ditches on the way of the gophers travel being
flooded with water. The ditches run in the West-East direction
and each ditch is of a constant width. The gopher still wants to
make his travels but being not a very good swimmer, he wants
to minimize the distance that he has to swim through the ditches
and with this requirement satisfied, he also wants to walk as lit-
tle as possible on the dry land. Your task is to find the length of
the gophers route which minimizes his swimming and then his
walking.

We are given a system of orthogonal coordinates,
where the x axis is directed from West to East and
the y axis is directed from South to North.

Given are real numbers: D and L, 0 < L, L+L <
D, such that a point (x, y) is on dry land if and only
if there exists an integer n such that n D+L  y 
(n+ 1) D  L.

Given is the starting point of the gopher (xs, ys)
and its target point (xt, yt). Both these points are on
dry land.
```

## Output

```
Each line of input contains six real numbers: D, L,
xs, ys, xt, yt.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input, output one line with the needed information in the format shown in the sample
output.
