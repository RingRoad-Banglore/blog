---


## Input

```
Given a string S and an integer K, another string T is obtained by concatenating S, K times. How
many distinct substrings are there in the string T?

For example, when S =ab, K = 2: T =abab and there are 7 distinct substrings in the string T
and they are: a, b, ab, ba, aba, bab and abab.
```

## Output

```
First line of input contains an integer T (< 101) which is the number of test cases. Each of the following
T lines contain a string S and an integer K (2  K  109). The length of S is at most 50000 and it
consists of lowercase letters only and the string is non-empty.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, output the case number followed by the number of distinct substrings. The input
will be such that the result will always fit into a 64-bit signed integer number.

```

## Sample Output

```
3
ab 3
abc 5
aba 4
