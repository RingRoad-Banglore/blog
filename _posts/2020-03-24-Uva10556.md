## Input

```text
Recently, the term Biometrics been used to refer to the emerging
field of technology devoted to identification of individuals using
biological traits, such as those based on retinal or iris scanning,
fingerprints, or face recognition.

A simple biometric system translates a human image into a
polygon by considering certain features (eyes, nose, ears, etc.) to
be vertices and connecting them with line segments. The poly-
gon has distinct vertices but may be degenerate in that the line
segments could intersect. Because these polygons are generally
created from remote images, there is some uncertainty as to their
scale and rotation. Your job is to determine whether or not two
polygons are similar; that is, can they be made equal by reposi-
tioning, rotating and magnifying them?
```

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of
three lines containing:

 f , the number of features

 f coordinate pairs giving the vertices of the first polygon

 f coordinate pairs giving the vertices of the second polygon

The vertices for both polygons correspond to the same set of features in the same order; for example,
right ear tip, chin cleft, right eye, nose, left eye, left ear tip, space between front teeth. Each polygon has
f distinct vertices; each vertex is given as an x and y coordinate pair. There are at least three and no
more than ten features. Coordinates are integers between -1000 and 1000. A line containing 0 follows
the last test case.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each case, output a line similar or dissimilar as appropriate. The two polygons are simi-
lar if, after some combination of translation, rotation, and scaling (but not reflection) both vertices
corresponding to each feature are in the same position.

```
