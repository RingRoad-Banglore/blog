## Input

```
John Digger is the owner of a large illudium phosdex mine. The mine is made up of a series of tunnels
that meet at various large junctions. Unlike some owners, Digger actually cares about the welfare of
his workers and has a concern about the layout of the mine. Specifically, he worries that there may a
junction which, in case of collapse, will cut off workers in one section of the mine from other workers
(illudium phosdex, as you know, is highly unstable). To counter this, he wants to install special escape
shafts from the junctions to the surface. He could install one escape shaft at each junction, but Digger
doesnt care about his workers that much. Instead, he wants to install the minimum number of escape
shafts so that if any of the junctions collapses, all the workers who survive the junction collapse will
have a path to the surface.

Write a program to calculate the minimum number of escape shafts and the total number of ways
in which this minimum number of escape shafts can be installed.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains a positive integer N
(N  5  104) indicating the number of mine tunnels. Following this are N lines each containing two
distinct integers s and t, where s and t are junction numbers. Junctions are numbered consecutively
starting at 1. Each pair of junctions is joined by at most a single tunnel. Each set of mine tunnels
forms one connected unit (that is, you can get from any one junction to any other).

The last test case is followed by a line containing a single zero.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, display its case number followed by the minimum number of escape shafts needed
for the system of mine tunnels and the total number of ways these escape shafts can be installed. You
may assume that the result fits in a signed 64-bit integer.

Follow the format of the sample output.
