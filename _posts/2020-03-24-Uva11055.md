title: Uva 11055  Homogeneous squares
---


## Input

```text
Assume you have a square of size n that is divided into n  n positions just as a checkerboard. Two
positions (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), where 1  x1, y1, x2, y2  n, are called independent if they occupy
different rows and different columns, that is, x1 = x2 and y1 = y2. More generally, n positions are
called independent if they are pairwise independent. It follows that there are n! different ways to choose
n independent positions.

Assume further that a number is written in each position of such an n  n square. This square is
called homogeneous if the sum of the numbers written in n independent positions is the same, no
matter how the positions are chosen. Write a program to determine if a given square is homogeneous!
```

## Output

```text
The input contains several test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1  n  1000). Each of the next n lines
contains n numbers, separated by exactly one space character. Each number is an integer from the
interval [-1000000,1000000].

The last test case is followed by a zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output whether the specified square is homogeneous or not. Adhere to the format
shown in the sample output.
