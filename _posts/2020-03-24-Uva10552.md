```
These days, everyone seems to be exploring
their ancestry. This effort is supported by fam-
ily history software, now marketed by a num-
ber of vendors. Unfortunately this software is
expensive and runs only on the McDoze X oper-
ating system. You are to write an open-source
equivalent.
```

## Input

```
Your program accepts a series of commands,
one per line. The commands are described by
the following syntax:

command ::= birth
::= death
::= ancestors
::= descendants
::= QUIT

birth ::= BIRTH child: date: mother: father

death ::= DEATH person: date

ancestors ::= ANCESTORS person

descendants ::= DESCENDANTS person

child ::= name

mother ::= name

father ::= name

person ::= name

date ::= name

name ::= <<any sequence of characters not beginning or ending
with a space or containing a colon>>

Spaces in the input are ignored except where they appear within name. The BIRTH and DEATH
commands record the birth and death of an individual. You may assume that each individual has a
unique name. The ANCESTORS and DESCENDANTS commands are queries: they print a family tree or a
reverse family tree for the named person, using the BIRTH and DEATH information entered by previous
commands. The QUIT command indicates the end of input.

```

## Output

```
The BIRTH, DEATH, and QUIT commands have no output. For each ANCESTORS (DESCENDANTS)
command, print the following information:

1. Print a line containing ANCESTORS of (DESCENDANTS of) followed by the persons name

2. Indented 2 spaces from the previous line, print the persons first parent (child) in alphabetical
order, followed by the parents (childs) birth date, followed by a space, followed by a hyphen,
and, if the parent (child) has died, another space and the date of death. If there is no birth record
for the parent (child), print the name alone.

3. Print the ancestry (descendant) information for the parent (child), indented another 2 spaces,
using these same steps (i.e. steps 2-4).

4. Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining parent (children). Indentation should be the same as for the
previous parent (child).

Leave an empty line between the output sequences for successive commands.
You may assume that no input line exceeds 100 characters, and that there are not more than 250

lines of input. You may assume that DEATH, ANCESTORS, and DESCENDANTS commands refer to a
name for which a BIRTH command has previously been given. QUIT appears only as the last line of
input.
