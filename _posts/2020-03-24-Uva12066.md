It is now year 3004, the ACM ICPC Programming Contest is still one of the largest and most
prestigious Programming Contest of the World. This contest began almost 1030 years ago and many
dont remember the history of this contest now. Some say that there is a wonderful story behind this
contest. The story goes as follows:

Long long ago there lived a happy dove couple who loved each other
very much. They were living peacefully but one day the female dove
became very ill. The male dove began roaming around everywhere
looking for proper medicine and found a wizard who knew the cure.
But the wizard would only give him (male dove) the medicine if he
could solve a problem for him, which was in the wizards mind for a
long time. As the problem was quite hard the male dove could not
solve it. At that time a few very kind men came to his rescue. They
gathered all the brilliant programmers from all over the world just to
solve the wizards problem, this gathering was known as the first ACM
ICPC World Finals. The wizards problem was solved and the female
dove got cured. Nice story! Isnt it? But the real problem is that now
you have to solve this problem on your own.

Figure 1 Figure 2

The wizards problem was related to a chessboard. Given an m n chessboard (m=number of rows
and n=number of columns) one has to go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. The
lower left corner is numbered as (0, 0) and the upper right corner is marked as (m 1, n 1) as shown
in Figure 1. But in each step one can only jump to another box that is p blocks away in the horizontal
direction and q blocks away in the vertical direction or viceversa. No such moves, which would take
one away from the destination, are allowed. So if the value p = 1 and q = 3 and one is in the r-th row
and c-th column or location (r, c) then he can only jump to location (r + 1, c+ 3) or (r + 3, c+ 1) but
he cannot jump to locations like (r 1, c+ 1) or (r 1, c 1), etc. In Figure 2 we can see a situation
where p = 2 and q = 1 (or p = 1 and q = 2). It shows two of the total six possible ways (considering

that no square is blocked) of going from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and each of
these two ways requires four steps to reach the destination. It also shows that the square at (2, 4) (row
2, column 4) is blocked, which has ruled out the possibility of a path through that square. Given the
value of m, n, p and q and position of the squares which are blocked, your job is to find out the number
of steps one requires to reach the destination and also the total number of possible ways to reach the
destination.

## Output

```text
The input file contains less than 100 sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:

Each line contains five integers m, n (6 < m,n < 4001), p, q (0 < p, q < 10) and b (0  b  10).
The meaning of m, n, p and q are described in the problem statement above. The integer b denotes
the number of squares that are blocked. Each of the next b lines contains two integers (ri, ci) which
denotes the row and column of the i-th blocked square.

Input is terminated by a set where the value of m = n = 0. This set should not be processed. Please
note that at least 90% of the input test cases follow the limit (6 < m,n < 300).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output, which contains two integers C and W . Here C is
the number of steps required to go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and W is the
total possible ways one can go from lower left corner to the upper right corner. If it is impossible to
go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner with the given configuration then print a line
Impossible instead as shown in the output for sample input. W can have at most 802 digits.
