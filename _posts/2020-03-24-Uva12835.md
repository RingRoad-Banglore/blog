## Input

```text

We are making a box to pack some regular octagonal pipes. The box is 8 feet wide, and the length of
each pipe is also 8 feet. But they have different cross sectional heights. A regular octagonal pipe has
equal cross sectional height and width. If you are unfamiliar with octagonal pipes, see pictures below.

These pipes will be placed in the box such that, their lengths align with the width of the box and
one of the eight sides must touch the boxs floor completely, which means, we cannot stack them one
above the other. The next picture will show you a particular packing example, where three pipes have
been packed in the box.

If you are given the cross sectional heights of pipes
we wish to pack in the box, can you calculate the min-
imum possible volume for the box? You can change
the order of pipes but you have to follow the rules for
placing them in the box.

You can assume, the number of pipes will be at
most 8, height of each pipe is no greater than 100,000
feet and there can be at most 100 test cases.
```

## Output

```text
First line of the input will be an integer T (1 
T  100) which indicates the number of test cases
to follow. For each test case, you will read an in-
teger N (1  N  8) followed by N integers Hi
(1  Hi  100000) where N is the number of pipes
and Hi is the cross sectional height of i-th pipe.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the case number and the desired volume of the box as shown in the sample
output section. Any floating point errors less than 106 will be ignored by the judge.

Note: It is up to you how many digits you want to print after decimal point. Just make sure that the
amount of error does not exceed the specified limit.
