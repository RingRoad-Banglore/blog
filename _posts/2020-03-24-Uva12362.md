## Input

```
Gary is a careful gardener that has a rectangular field full of trees. There are two kinds of trees in his
land: pines and larches. To improve their vitality, he decided to start using a specific fertilizer for each
kind of tree, instead of the generic fertilizer he was using so far.

Since Gary has many trees, fertilizers cannot be placed individually on each tree. For this reason
he decided to build a fence to separate the field in two, and use the pine fertilizer on one side and the
larch fertilizer on the other side. The new fence will be built over a straight line connecting two distinct
points located on the boundary of the land.

Sadly, each fertilizer is great for the kind of tree it is intended, but deadly for the other. After
building the fence and deciding which fertilizer will be used on each side, larches in pines side and pines
in larches side will be cut down, to prevent a slow death that will ruin the landscape. Furthermore,
before building the fence it is necessary to cut down trees of any kind lying directly over the line where
the fence will be located.

Of course, Gary loves his trees. Depending on their kind, age and other factors, each tree has a
certain value. The gardener wants to build the fence and select where to use each fertilizer in such a
way that his loss is minimized, where the loss is the sum of the values of the trees that will be cut down.

You were hired to build the fence. Before starting your work, tell Gary how much he will lose when
choosing optimally the location of the fence and the fertilizer for each side.

## Output

```
Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains two integers P and L, representing
respectively the number of pines and the number of larches (1  P,L  1000). Each of the next P lines
describes a pine. After that, each of the next L lines describes a larch. Trees are modeled as points
in the XY plane. Each tree is described using three integers X, Y and V , where X and Y are the
coordinates of the tree (105  X,Y  105), and V is its value (1  V  1000). You may assume that
within each test case no two trees have the same location.

The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.

## Sample Input

```
For each test case output a line with an integer representing the minimum possible loss for the gardener.
