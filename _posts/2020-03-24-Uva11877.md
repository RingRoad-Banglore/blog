title: Uva 11877  The CocoCola Store
---


## Input

```
Once upon a time, there is a special coco-cola store. If you return three empty bottles to the shop,
youll get a full bottle of coco-cola to drink. If you have n empty bottles right in your hand, how many
full bottles of coco-cola can you drink?
```

## Output

```
There will be at most 10 test cases, each containing a single line with an integer n (1  n  100). The
input terminates with n = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the number of full bottles of coco-cola that you can drink.

Spoiler
Let me tell you how to drink 5 full bottles with 10 empty bottles: get 3 full bottles with 9 empty

bottles, drink them to get 3 empty bottles, and again get a full bottle from them. Now you have 2
empty bottles. Borrow another empty bottle from the shop, then get another full bottle. Drink it, and
finally return this empty bottle to the shop!

```

## Sample Output

```
3
10
81
0

```
