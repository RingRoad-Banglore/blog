title: Uva 10373  The Brick Stops Here
---


```
You have been hired by several clients of a factory that manufactures brass bricks. Brass is an alloy of
copper and zinc; each brick weighs 1000 grams, and the copper content of a brick can range from 1 to 999
grams. (Note that brass with less than 55% or more than 62% of copper is practically useless; however,
this is irrelevant for this question) The factory manufactures, through various processes, different types
of brick, each of which has a different copper concentration and price. It distributes a catalog of these
types to its customers.

Your clients desire to buy a certain number (M) of bricks, which for, uh, religious reasons must be
of different types. They will be melted together, and the resultant mixture must have a concentration
of at least CMin and at most CMax grams of copper per kilogram. Their goal is to pick the M types
of brick so that the mixture has the correct concentration and the price of the collection is minimized.
You must figure out how to do this. M , CMin, and CMax will vary depending on the client.

## Input

```
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank
line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

The first part of input consists of a line containing a number N (1  N  200), the number of brick
types, and then N lines containing the copper concentration (between 1 and 999) and price (in cents)
of each brick type. No brick costs more than 10 dollars.

The second part consists of a line containing a number C (1  C  100), the number of clients you
are serving, followed by C lines containing M (1  M  20), CMin (1  CMin  999), and CMax
(1  CMax  999) for each client.

All input numbers will be positive integers.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two
consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

Output consists of a line for each client containing the minimum possible price for which they
can purchase bricks to meet their demands. If there is no way to match their specifications, output
impossible.
