title: Uva 01288  Shortest Flight Path
---


## Input

```
Commercial flights are statistically quite safe (in terms of number of deaths per passenger-kilometer,
only going to the moon is safer). But there are still reasons for precautions and safety regulations. An
early such rule was the so-called 60-minute rule, which required that a two-engine plane must always
be within 60 minutes of the nearest adequate airport along its entire flight path. A variety of similar
rules have existed, but at their core, they remain the same: the flight path can not take the airplane
more than a certain maximum allowed distance from the nearest airport. With these restrictions, planes
cannot always use a direct route for flying from one airport to another.

In this problem we will compute the shortest flight path between two airports while adhering to a
maximum allowed distance rule. In the figure below, which illustrates the first sample test case, any
flight route has to stay within the three circles. Thus a plane going from airport 2 to airport 3 has to
detour from the direct route via the region around airport 1. Note that the plane would not necessarily
have to go to airport 1 itself.

Things are further complicated by the fact that planes have limited fuel supply, and to go longer
distances they may need to make a stopover at intermediate airports. Thus, depending on the fuel
capacity, a plane going from airport 2 to airport 3 in the figure might have to stop over at airport 1 (or
the fuel capacity might be too low even to go to airport 1, in which case the trip would be impossible
to make).

We make the following simplifying assumptions:

1. The surface of the earth is a sphere of radius 6370 km.

2. Both time and fuel consumption are directly proportional to distance traveled. In other words we
are interested only in total distance traveled.

3. The difference in distance caused by planes flying at different altitudes is negligible. Thus, effec-
tively, we assume them to be flying along the earths surface.

4. A plane may stop for refueling at as many intermediate airports as needed, each time getting a
full tank.

## Output

```
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and R, where 2  N  25 is the number of
airports and 1  R  10000 is the maximum allowed flight distance (in km) from the nearest airport.
Each of the next N lines contains two integers ,  satisfying 0   < 360 and 90    90, the
longitude and latitude (respectively) of an airport, in degrees. The airports are numbered according to
their order in the input starting from one. No two airports are at the same position.

Following this is a line containing an integer Q, satisfying 1  Q  100. Each of the next Q lines
contains three integers s, t, c satisfying 1  s, t  N , s = t, and 1  c  50000, indicating a plane
going from airport s to airport t with a fuel capacity yielding a range of c km.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, display the case number followed by one line for each query containing the length
in km of the shortest flight path between airport s and t, subject to the fuel constraint c. Display the
length accurate to three decimal places. If there is no permissible path between the two airports, then
display the word impossible instead.

You may assume the answer is numerically stable for perturbations of up to 0.1 km of R or c.
