title: Uva 12235  Help Bubu
---


```
Bubus bookshelf is in a mess! Help him!

There are n books on his bookshelf. We define the mess value to be the number of segments of
consecutive equal-height books. For example, if the book heights are 30, 30, 31, 31, 32, the mess
value is 3, that of 30, 32, 32, 31 is also 3, but the mess value of 31, 32, 31, 32, 31 is 5  its indeed in
a mess!

Bubu wants to reduce the mess value as much as possible, but hes a little bit tired, so he decided
to take out at most k books, then put them back somewhere in the shelf. Could you help him?
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 20 test cases. Each case begins with two positive integers n and k (1  k 
n  100), the total number of books, and the maximum number of books to take out. The next line
contains n integers, the heights of each book, from left to right. Each height is an integer between 25
and 32, inclusive. The last test case is followed by n = k = 0, which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and the minimal final mess value.

Print a blank line after the output of each test case.
