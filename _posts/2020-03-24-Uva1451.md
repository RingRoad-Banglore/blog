## Input

```

A DNA sequence consists of four letters, A, C, G, and T. The GC-ratio of a DNA sequence is the
number of Cs and Gs of the sequence divided by the length of the sequence. GC-ratio is important
in gene finding because DNA sequences with relatively high GC-ratios might be good candidates for
the starting parts of genes. Given a very long DNA sequence, researchers are usually interested in
locating a subsequence whose GC-ratio is maximum over all subsequences of the sequence. Since short
subsequences with high GC-ratios are sometimes meaningless in gene finding, a length lower bound is
given to ensure that a long subsequence with high GC-ratio could be found. If, in a DNA sequence,
a 0 is assigned to every A and T and a 1 to every C and G, the DNA sequence is transformed into a
binary sequence of the same length. GC-ratios in the DNA sequence are now equivalent to averages in
the binary sequence.

Position 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
Index 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Sequence 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0

For the binary sequence above, if the length lower bound is 7, the maximum average is 6/8 which
happens in the subsequence [7,14]. Its length is 8, which is greater than the length lower bound 7. If
the length lower bound is 5, then the subsequence [7,11] gives the maximum average 4/5. The length
is 5 which is equal to the length lower bound. For the subsequence [7,11], 7 is its starting index and 11
is its ending index.

Given a binary sequence and a length lower bound L, write a program to find a subsequence of the
binary sequence whose length is at least L and whose average is maximum over all subsequences of the
binary sequence. If two or more subsequences have the maximum average, then find the shortest one;
and if two or more shortest subsequences with the maximum average exist, then find the one with the
smallest starting index.

## Output

```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test
cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers
n (1  n  100, 000) and L (1  L  1, 000) which are the length of a binary sequence and a length
lower bound, respectively. In the next line, a string, binary sequence, of length n is given.
