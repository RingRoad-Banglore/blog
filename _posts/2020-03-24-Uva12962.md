title: Uva 12962  Average Reuse Distance
---


## Input

```
Calculating the reuse distance of a certain memory location is a very common technique in computer
architecture, since it offers knowledge about the locality of programs that is independent of the archi-
tecture of the machine.

The reuse distance of a reference to a memory address in a program is defined by the number of
different addresses that have been referenced since the last reference to the same address. In other
words, if a program references the addresses a, b, c, d, and a (we will denote addresses by lower-
case letters), the reuse distance of the last reference to a (with respect to the previous reference to
a) is 3, since references to 3 different addresses have been performed. Similarly, if the references in a
program are a, b, b, and a, the reuse distance of the last reference to a will be 1.

Your task is to write a program that calculates the average reuse distance of a sequence of references.
You have to consider that the first reference to an address does not have reuse distance, and therefore
is not computed.
```

## Output

```
The program input consists of several lines, each one with a sequence of characters from a to z
representing references to different memory locations. The input terminates with a line with the string
0.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line, your program must print the average reuse distance of the performed references with
four decimal digits, or NaN (Not a Number) if no reference is reused. The forth decimal digit must
be rounded to the nearest value; for example, 1.000049 must be printed as 1.0000; and 1.00005 and
1.00006 must be printed as 1.0001.

Hint: in C++, use:

#include <iomanip>
...
cout << setprecision(4) << fixed;

```
