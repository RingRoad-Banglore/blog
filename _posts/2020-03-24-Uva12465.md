Turanga Leela, from
Futurama

Its been a few years since Bender solved his famous bending problem. Today,
Turanga Leela, son of Morris and Munda and captain of the Planet Express
spaceship, is playing a game with Bender and Philip J. Fry.

Everybody knows that Leela is cyclop. When Leela was still an infant, her
parents gave her up to an orphanarium with a note scribbled with mysterious
symbols to make an impression that Leela was an alien, so that she would
have a better life than a typical mutant. But other kids used to make fun of
her only eye, so Leela had a very perturbing childhood.

Bender and Philip J. Fry are making fun of Leela, because apparently she
doesnt know how to count (they say her parents didnt know how to count
either, and thats why she has only one eye. Then they burst out in explosive
laughter). She insists that she knows how to count, but secretly she needs
your help.

Philip J. Fry chooses a positive integer a, and Bender chooses a positive
integer b. Leela is supposed to count the number of positive integers m such
that a and b leave the same remainder when divided by m. In other words,
shes supposed to find the size of the set {m  ZZ>0 | a  b (mod m)}.

But shes totally clueless on how to proceed. Help her, please!

## Output

```text
The input file contains several test cases (at most 150). Each test case is described with two different
integers a and b on a single line (1  a, b  109).

The last line contains two zeros and should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output one integer on a single line  the number of positive integers m such that a
and b leave the same remainer when divided by m.

Explanation of the sample cases:

 2 and 3 only leave the same remainder when divided by 1.

 2 and 4 leave the same remainder when divided by 1 or 2.

 5 and 7 leave the same remainder when divided by 1 or 2.

 4 and 8 leave the same remainder when divided by 1, 2 or 4.

 100 and 205 leave the same remainder when divided by 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35 or 105.

 33043387 and 255936619 leave the same remainder when divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24,
48, 569, 1138, 1707, 2276, 3414, 4552, 6828, 8161, 9104, 13656, 16322, 24483, 27312, 32644,
