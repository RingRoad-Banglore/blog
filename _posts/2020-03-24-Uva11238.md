As you all know Homer Jay Simpson is an enthusiastic bowling player. The last times when he played
with his friends Carl and Lenny, Homer always scored the same number of points, but the games differed
in at least one frame. Carl wonders how often Homer can reach the same number of points without
playing any two identical games.

For those of you who never enjoyed the great game of bowling we will explain the rules of bowling
in detail:

A bowling game consists of ten frames. Each frame starts with ten pins standing that you attempt
to knock down by rolling a bowling ball towards the pins. A frame ends after two attempts or if there is
no pin left standing. For each frame you get the number of pins you knocked down as points. However
there are some bonus points if you manage to knock down all the pins.

If you knock down all ten pins in the first attempt it is called a strike and you get as a bonus the
number of pins knocked down in the next two attempts (which belong to the next frame(s)). If you
manage to knock down all the remaining pins in the second attempt it is called a spare and you get
the number of pins knocked down in the next attempt as a bonus (again, this attempt belongs to the
next frame). In the last frame there are special rules for the bonus points: If you have got a spare/strike
you have one/two additional bonus attempt(s) which count only as bonus points. If you have got two
bonus attempts and have knocked down all pins with your first attempt, you start again with 10 pins
for your second bonus attempt. As you may notice, it is possible to score a maximum of 30 points in
each frame, thereby scoring 300 points in total.

Your task is to help Carl to calculate the number of different bowling games which result in a specific
score.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer s
(0  s  300), the score for which you have to calculate the number of different bowling games.

The last test case is followed by a line containing -1.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the number of different bowling games resulting in the given score in one line.
You may assume that this number fits into a signed 64-bit integer (in C/C++ you can use the data
type long long, in JAVA the data type long).
