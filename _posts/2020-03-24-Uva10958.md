title: Uva 10958  How Many Solutions?
---


## Input

```text
Given the values of three integers m, n, p how many integer solutions does the following equation have?

m

x
+

n

y
=

1

p
```

## Output

```text
The input file contains at most 1001 sets of inputs. Each set of input is given in a single line containing
three integers which denotes the values of m, n and p respectively.

Input is terminated by a case where the value of m, n and p (1000  m,n, p  1000) is zero.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input produce one line of output which contains the serial of output followed by an
integer N which indicates how many solutions are there for the given value of m, n and p.

Comment: The equation corresponding to the first sample input is: 1
x
+ 2

y
= 1

4
and the 11 solutions

corresponding to this equation is:

-28 7
-12 6
-4 4
2 -8
3 -24
5 40
6 24
8 16
12 12
20 10
36 9

```

## Sample Output

```text
1 2 4
2 3 4
0 0 0

```
