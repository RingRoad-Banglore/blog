All rooms of the maze are equal sized with all walls 3 points wide and 1 point thick as illustrated
in figure 2. In addition, a wall is shared on its full length by the separated rooms. The rooms can
communicate through doors, which are positioned in the middle of walls. There are no outdoor doors.

Figure 2. A room with 3 doors

Your problem is to paint all rooms of a maze which can be visited starting from a given room, called
the start room which is marked by a star (*) positioned in the middle of the room. A room can be
visited from another room if there is a door on the wall which separates the rooms. By convention, a
room is painted if its entire surface, including the doors, is marked by the character # as shown in
figure 1b.
```

## Output

```text
The program input is a text file structured as follows:

1. The first line contains a positive integer which shows the number of mazes to be painted.

2. The rest of the file contains the mazes.

The lines of the input file can be of different length. The text which represents a maze is terminated
by a separation line full of underscores ( ). There are at most 30 lines and at most 80 characters in a
line for each maze. The program reads the mazes from the standard input.
