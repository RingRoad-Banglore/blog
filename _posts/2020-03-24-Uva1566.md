## Input

```text

Little John is playing very funny game with his younger brother. There is one big box filled with M&Ms
of different colors. At first John has to eat several M&Ms of the same color. Then his opponent has to
make a turn. And so on. Please note that each player has to eat at least one M&M during his turn. If
John (or his brother) will eat the last M&M from the box he will be considered as a looser and he will
have to buy a new candy box.

Both of players are using optimal game strategy. John starts first always. You will be given
information about M&Ms and your task is to determine a winner of such a beautiful game.
