```
Your task is to design a 4-input 4-output digital circuit, given some 2-input 1-output gates.

Every gate is described by three 0-1 integers
Y00, Y01 and Y11, the output of the gate when
there are exactly 0, 1 and 2 of the inputs are set
to 1. Note that all the gates are symmetric, so if
there is exactly one input is set to 1, the output
is the same no matter which one is set. Make
sure that both inputs of each gate are connected
to the output of another gate or a signal source,
since the output will be unpredictable if at least
one input is dangling. Be aware that the output
of a gate can never go back to its input either
directly or indirectly (i.e. the circuit should not contain a directed cycle).

To make your design as simple as possible, you should use minimal number of gates. It is guaranteed
that the circuit could be designed with at most 6 gates.
```

## Input

```
The input consists of at most 30 test cases. Each case contains a single integer n (n < 6), indicating
there are n kinds of gates. Each of the n lines contained four integers, mi, Y00, Y01, Y11, the number
of available gates of this kind, the output values when exactly 0, 1, 2 inputs are set to 1. There are
at most 10 gates in total (i.e. the sum of mi will not exceed 10). The next line contains 16 integers
Y0000, Y0001, Y0010, . . . , Y1111, the output values for each possible input combination. Yprqss binary form
is the output of the circuit when the four inputs are p, q, r, s respectively. That is, if Ypqrss binary
form is abcd, then the four outputs are a, b, c, d respectively. The last case is followed by a single zero,
which should not be processed.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and an integer p, the minimal number of gates required. The
next p lines each contains four integers s, k, a and b, where s is the serial number of the gate (inputs of
the entire circuit are numbered 14, gates are numbered 5p+4), k is the type number of the gate (gate
types are numbered 1n in the same order as they appeared in the input), a and b are serial numbers
of two inputs of the gate. It should be satisfied that a < s and b < s. The last line should contain four
integers: the serial numbers of the gates of four outputs (should be all between 1 and p + 4). There
should be exactly one empty line after each case.
