12818 Arc and Point

Given a circular arc (i.e. part of the circumference of a circle) and a point P , your task is to calculate
the shortest distance between them. That means, you should find a point on the arc, whose distance
to P is minimized.

Attention: Try to use exact algorithms. Approximation algorithms are harder to pass the judge data.

## Input

There will be at most 10000 test cases. Each case contains 8 integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, xp, yp. The
arc starts from A(x1, y1), goes through B(x2, y2) and ends at C(x3, y3). The point is located at (xp, yp).
It is guaranteed that A, B, C are different points and will not be collinear. The absolute values of all
coordinates are not greater than 20.

## Output

For each test case, print the case number and the distance, to three decimal places. Absolute error of
0.001 is allowed.
