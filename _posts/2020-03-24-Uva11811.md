```
Programming contests are now too frequent in Bangladesh. Just
5 years ago, you could participate in only one or two contest per
year, but now, there is one in almost every month. Moreover, they
are also in different cities around the country. Maybe, someday,
you will see contests in every week, or maybe every day.

Due to the schedule of the contests, the contestants are really
conscious about optimizing the time spent in traveling. For ex-
ample, if the contest starts at 9:00AM, they plan to reach contest
venue, just before that time, so that, no time is wasted.

Contestants will be using various forms of public transporta-
tions like bus, train, taxi, rickshaw to reach the contest spot. Bus
and train may be used to transport between cities, taxi and rick-
shaws may be used to move within cities. You will be given all
the routes one can use to move between cities. Since, contestants
are optimizing their time spent in the contest, they will always
take the fastest route possible. Rickshaws and taxis always use
the fastest route, so you dont have to be concerned about them.

As the programming contests have become popular, it also caught interest of the mafias as well.
They are planning to sabotage this contest. For that, they will call strike in different cities, and thus,
no vehicle enters or leaves the city. You cant even use rickshaws and taxi to move in the city during
the strike. So, it wont be possible for any team to travel through the city, and may have to use a
longer route. If they cant use their shortest route, they will surely be late, and thus, cannot attend
the contest.

Mafia lords have a list of teams. They will call strike in minimum number of cities, so that these
teams are unable attend the contest. There may be more than one set of cities they can call strike to
sabotage the contest, in those cases, they will probably choose the one that affects minimum number
of cities.

You have some how managed to know about this evil plan. Now, given the list of cities, you have
to find the how many cities will be affected by it.

## Input

```
Input starts with an integer T (T  30), the number of test cases.

Each test case starts with two integers N , M (1  N  100000, 0  M  500000) the number of
cities and the number of direct routes between cities. Each city is denoted by an integer between 0 and
N  1. The contest is going to be held in city 0. Each of the next M lines each contain three integers,
u, v, t (0  u, v < N , 1  t  1000), a route between city u and v that takes time t. There will be at
most one direct route between two cities.

This is followed by an integer Q (1  Q  1000), the number of queries. Next Q lines each describe
a query. Each query starts with an integer K (1  K  100), the number of teams in the list, followed
by K integers ni (0  ni < N).

There will be a blank line before each test case.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output the case number. For each query, output
