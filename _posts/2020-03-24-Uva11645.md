title: Uva 11645  Bits
---


```
A bit is a binary digit, taking a logical value of either 1 or 0 (also referred to as true or false
respectively). And every decimal number has a binary representation which is actually a series of bits.
If a bit of a number is 1 and its next bit is also 1 then we can say that the number has a 1 adjacent
bit. And you have to find out how many times this scenario occurs for all numbers up to N .

Examples:

Number Binary Adjacent Bits
12 1100 1
15 1111 3
27 11011 2
```

## Input

```
For each test case, you are given an integer number (0  N  ((263)2)), as described in the statement.
The last test case is followed by a negative integer in a line by itself, denoting the end of input file.

```

## Output

```
For every test case, print a line of the form Case X: Y , where X is the serial of output (starting
from 1) and Y is the cumulative summation of all adjacent bits from 0 to N .

```

## Sample Input

```
0
6
15
20
21
22
-1

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 0
Case 2: 2
Case 3: 12
Case 4: 13
Case 5: 13
Case 6: 14
```
