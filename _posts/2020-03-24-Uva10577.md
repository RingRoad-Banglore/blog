## Input

```
The Archeologists of the Current Millenium (ACM) now and then discover ancient artifacts located at
vertices of regular polygons. The moving sand dunes of the desert render the excavations difficult and
thus once three vertices of a polygon are discovered there is a need to cover the entire polygon with
protective fabric.
```

## Output

```
Input contains multiple cases. Each case describes one polygon. It starts with an integer n  50, the
number of vertices in the polygon, followed by three pairs of real numbers giving the x and y coordinates
of three vertices of the polygon. The numbers are separated by whitespace. The input ends with a n
equal 0, this case should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each line of input, output one line in the format shown below, giving the smallest area of a rectangle
which can cover all the vertices of the polygon and whose sides are parallel to the x and y axes.

```
