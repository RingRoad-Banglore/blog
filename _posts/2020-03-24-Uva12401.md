title: Uva 12401  Metal Powers
---


```
I suppose everyone here has heard of the famous golden ratio
 = 1+


5

2
 1.618. This number possesses numerous interest-

ing properties, one of which is illustrated by the following brain-
teaser:

What is the 200th significant digit of 600 ( to
the 600th power)?

The answer is 9. This is because n + (1  )n is an integer
for any positive integer n, and (1  )600 is an extremely small
positive number.

In this problem we introduce two more metal ratios: the silver ratio 2+

8

2
 2.414 and the

bronze ratio 3+

13

2
 3.303. (These terms are certainly not made up by us; try searching silver

ratio in MathWorld and youll see the numbers. Oh wait, Bronze is NOT a metal, hmm...) Curiously,
each of these three ratios, when raised to the n-th power (for n large enough), is very close to an integer.
(Perhaps it is not that curious for those who know difference equations.) Let us call these approximate
integers the Metal Powers. Your job is to write a program that computes them.
```

## Input

```
Input has no more than 250 lines, each containing a value of n (0  n  100000000) followed by one of
the uppercase letters G (for Golden), S (for Silver) or B (for Bronze).

```

## Output

```
For each case, your program should give the corresponding Metal Power. (For example, the 600th
Golden Power means the closest integer to 600.) If any result contains more than nine digits, you
only need to give its first three and last three significant digits, together with its total number of digits,
as shown in the sample output. You must use the suffixes th, st, nd and rd appropriately.

Explanation: The exact value for the third sample case is:

102266868132036

```

## Sample Input

```
0 G
2 S
27 B

```

## Sample Output

```
The 0th Golden Power is 1.
The 2nd Silver Power is 6.
The 27th Bronze Power is 102...036(15 digits).
```
