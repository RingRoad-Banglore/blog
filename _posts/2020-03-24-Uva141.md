title: Uva 00141  The Spot Game
---


## Input

```text
The game of Spot is played on an N N board as shown below for N = 4. During the game, alternate
players may either place a black counter (spot) in an empty square or remove one from the board, thus
producing a variety of patterns. If a board pattern (or its rotation by 90 degrees or 180 degrees) is
repeated during a game, the player producing that pattern loses and the other player wins. The game
terminates in a draw after 2N moves if no duplicate pattern is produced before then.

Consider the following patterns:

If the first pattern had been produced earlier, then any of the following three patterns (plus one
other not shown) would terminate the game, whereas the last one would not.
```

## Output

```text
Input will consist of a series of games, each consisting of the size of the board, N (2  N  50)
followed, on separate lines, by 2N moves, whether they are all necessary or not. Each move will consist
of the coordinates of a square (integers in the range 1..N) followed by a blank and a character + or -
indicating the addition or removal of a spot respectively. You may assume that all moves are legal, that
is there will never be an attempt to place a spot on an occupied square, nor to remove a non-existent
spot. Input will be terminated by a zero (0).

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output will consist of one line for each game indicating which player won and on which move, or that
