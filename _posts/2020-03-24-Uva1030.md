title: Uva 01030  Image Is Everything
---


```
Your new company is building a robot that can hold small lightweight objects. The robot will have
the intelligence to determine if an object is light enough to hold. It does this by taking pictures of the
object from the 6 cardinal directions, and then inferring an upper limit on the objects weight based on
those images. You must write a program to do that for the robot.

You can assume that each object is formed from an N  N  N lattice of cubes, some of which
may be missing. Each 1 1 1 cube weighs 1 gram, and each cube is painted a single solid color. The
object is not necessarily connected.
```

## Input

```
The input for this problem consists of several test cases representing different objects. Every case
begins with a line containing N , which is the size of the object (1  N  10). The next N lines are the
different N N views of the object, in the order front, left, back, right, top, bottom. Each view will be
separated by a single space from the view that follows it. The bottom edge of the top view corresponds
to the top edge of the front view. Similarly, the top edge of the bottom view corresponds to the bottom
edge of the front view. In each view, colors are represented by single, unique capital letters, while a
period (.) indicates that the object can be seen through at that location.

Input for the last test case is followed by a line consisting of the number 0.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print a line containing the maximum possible weight of the object, using the format
shown below.
