title: Uva 12656  Almost Palindrome
---


```

Given a line of text, find the longest almost-palindrome substring. A string S is almost-palindrome if

1. S begins and ends with a letter, and

2. a(S) and b(S) have at most 2k positions with different characters

Here a(S) is the string after removing all non-letter characters and converting all the letters to
lowercase, b(S) is the reversed string of a(S).

For example, when k = 1, Race cat is almost-palindrome, because a(S)=racecat and
b(S)=tacecar differ at exactly 2 positions.
```

## Input

```
There will be at most 25 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line is k (0  k  200).
The second line contains a string with at least one letter and at most 1,000 characters (excluding the
newline character). The string will only contain letters, spaces and other printable characters like (,
or . etc) and will not start with a whitespace.

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the length of the longest almost-palindrome substring and its starting position
(starting from 1). If there is more than one such string, print the smallest starting position.

```

## Sample Input

```
1

Wow, it is a Race cat!

0

abcdefg

0

Kitty: Madam, Im adam.

```

## Sample Output

```

Case 1: 8 3

Case 2: 1 1

Case 3: 15 8
```
