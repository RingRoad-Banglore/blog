## Input

```text
This problem doesnt have a story. You just have to write a calculator which could perform simple
binary operations. You will be given an expression and your program should calculate its result.
Expression is formed according to this rules:

<digit> ::= 0|1
<number> ::= <digit>|<digit><number>
<unary_operator> :== not | shr | shl
<binary_operator> :== xor | and | or
<token> ::= <number> | <unary_operator> <token> | <token> <binary_operator> <token>
<expression> ::= <token> | <token> <expression>

Operation definitions:
not  binary negation operation (example: not 101 = 010)
shr  binary right shift operation (example: shr 101 = 10)
shl  binary left shift operation (example: shl 101 = 1010)
xor  binary exclusive or operation (example: 0111 xor 1011 = 1100)
and  binary and operation (example: 0111 and 1011 = 0011)
or  binary or operation (example: 0111 or 1011 = 1111)

All unary operators have higher priority than binary ones and binary operators must be calculated
from left to right (their priority is considered equal). Before any unary operation all additional leading
zeros should be removed (for example 0011 becomes 11 and 000 becomes 0), and before a binary one
you should align binary numbers by adding leading zeros if necessary (for example 11 xor 101 becomes
011 xor 101).
```

## Output

```text
The number of tests T (T  100) is given on the first line. Each of next T lines contains an expression
itself. Length of the expression will be always less than 1000 characters.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output a single line Case T: N . Where T is the test case number (starting from
1) and N is the value of evaluated expression in the same binary form. Answer should not contain any
leading zeroes.

```

## Sample Output

```text
4
shl not 101
not 11 and 111
111 xor not 0
shl 0
