title: Uva 12343  Strange Summation
---


## Input

```
Mr Foolizm is learning binary numbers. He has a software that converts any decimal integer to binary
and vice versa. So, if he is asked to add some decimal numbers, he first converts them to binary. Then
he adds them in binary. But he doesnt understand the carry principle yet and he even doesnt know
the idea of positioning the numbers. Instead of LSD (least significant digit), he starts summing from
MSD (most significant digit). So, if he is asked to add four integers from 1 to 4, he does the following:

1. He first takes 1 and 2 and convert them to binary using his software, and then he adds them like
the following:

1
10
-----
00

2. Then he takes 3, converts it to binary and add it with the previous result

00
11
-----
11

3. He then takes 4, converts it to binary and add it with the previous result

11
100
-----
010

4. And finally he converts the result back to decimal, so, the result is 2.

Now you are given two integers p and q, your task is to find the result if Mr Foolizm adds all integers
from p to q (inclusive) in his procedure.
```

## Output

```
Input starts with an integer T ( 10000), denoting the number of test cases. Each case starts with a
line containing two integers: p and q (0 < p < q < 263).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each case, print the case number and the result.

```

## Sample Output

```
4
1 4
2 5
1 2147483647
7 12
