title: Uva 11703  sqrt log sin
---


```
An evil professor has just assigned you
the following problem.

A sequence is defined by the following
recurrence:

x0 = 1
xi = xi


i + xln(i) + xi sin2(i)

Determine x1000000.
```

## Input

```
Input consists of a number of lines, each
containing one integer, a value of i, no
less than zero and no greater than one
million. Input is followed by a single line
containing the integer -1. This last line
is not a value of i and should not be pro-
cessed.

```

## Output

```
For each value of i in the input (but not
the final -1), output the corresponding
value of xi modulo 1000000.

```

## Sample Input

```
0
-1

```

## Sample Output

```
1
```
