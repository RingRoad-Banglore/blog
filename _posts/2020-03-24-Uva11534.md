## Input

```text

Alice was bored with the game tic-tac-toe. Usually she
used to play against computer. She was so bored because,
she always managed to make a tie against computer as she
already became an expert in this game. She was also bored
about the matching things, that means she does not like to
see two adjacent Xs or two adjacent Os. So Bob created
a new computer game for her.

Here is the description of this new 2-player game:

 A 1N grid will be given.

 In each turn A player can mark an unmarked cell by
an X or by an O (No Zero it is big O).

 No two adjacent Xs are allowed in this game.

 No two adjacent Os are allowed in this game.

 The player who marks the last cell wins the game.

Lets have an example for N = 3. Suppose first player mark the leftmost cell with an X. Then the
grid will look like this -

From this state, the winning move of the second player is to mark the rightmost cell with an O.

Now first player has no move, because in the only empty cell she cannot mark X and cannot mark
O because the left of this cell is already marked X and the right of this cell is marked O. The second
player will win.

But this is not an optimal example for first player. If in first move, the first player marks the middle
cell with any one of X or O, she will win.

Now about Bobs computer game, Alice always makes the first move. Alice usually used to start
playing with Bob. But most often after some move, Bob gave his responsibility to the computer.
Computer always play optimally.

Your are given the state of the grid after Bobs departure and your task is to determine whether it
is possible to win against computer from this state for Alice.

the next T line there is a string which represents the state of the game after Bobs departure. Here the
length of the string is N (0 < N < 101). In this string besides X and O, another character . is used,
which represents an unmarked cell.
