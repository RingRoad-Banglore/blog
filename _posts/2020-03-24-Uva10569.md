```
Given a positive integer n, you are to find am integer f, such that:

f3 = a31 + a
3
2 +   + a

3
n

where all a1, a2, . . . , an are distinct positive integers.

For example,
if n = 3, one valid f is 71, since 713 = 143 + 233 + 703 = 357911.
if n = 4, one valid f is 100, since 1003 = 563 + 583 + 673 + 693 = 1000000.

Your number f may be big, but it has at most 250 digits.
```

## Input

```
The first line contains the number of tests t (1  t  20). Each case contains a single line with a
positive integer n (1  n  100).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, print the case number and n + 1 numbers: f, a1, a2, . . . , an. If no f exists, print a
-1 and n zeros.

```

## Sample Input

```
3
3
2
4

```

## Sample Output

```
Case 1: 71 14 23 70
Case 2: -1 0 0
Case 3: 100 56 58 67 69
```
