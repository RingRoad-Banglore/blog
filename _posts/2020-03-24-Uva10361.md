## Input

```
Oh God, Lara Croft exclaims, its one of these dumb riddles again!

In Tomb Raider XIV, Lara is, as ever, gunning her way through ancient Egyptian pyramids, pre-
historic caves and medival hallways. Now she is standing in front of some important Germanic looking
doorway and has to solve a linguistic riddle to pass. As usual, the riddle is not very intellectually
challenging.

This time, the riddle involves poems containing a Schuttelreim. An example of a Schuttelreim is
the following short poem:

Ein Kind halt seinen Schnabel nur,
wenn es hangt an der Nabelschnur.

Note: German users, please, forgive me. I had to modify something as they were not appearing
correctly in plain text format

A Schuttelreim seems to be a typical German invention. The funny thing about this strange type
of poetry is that if somebody gives you the first line and the beginning of the second one, you can
complete the poem yourself. Well, even a computer can do that, and your task is to write a program
which completes them automatically. This will help Lara concentrate on the action part of Tomb
Raider and not on the intellectual part.
```

## Output

```
The input will begin with a line containing a single number n. After this line follow n pairs of lines
containing Schuttelreims. The first line of each pair will be of the form

s1<s2>s3<s4>s5

where the si are possibly empty, strings of lowercase characters or blanks. The second line will be
a string of lowercase characters or blanks ending with three dots .... Lines will we at most 100
characters long.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each pair of Schuttelreim lines l1 and l2 you are to output two lines c1 and c2 in the following way:
c1 is the same as l1 only that the bracket marks < and > are removed. Line c2 is the same as l2 ,
except that instead of the three dots the string s4s3s2s5 should appear.
