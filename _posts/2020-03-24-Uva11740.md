title: Uva 11740  How Dark can it be
---


## Input

```
Little Dipto is fascinated by shadows. He spends hours
holding up various objects in front of the wall, watching the
shadow grow and shrink as he moves the object. But these
days he has been developing a special interest in shadows
of polygons; convex polygons to be precise. But he cannot
seem to be able to predict the size of the shadow before he
actually cuts out a paper polygon and forms a shadow of it
on the wall. He has now turned to you for help.
```

## Output

```
The input consists of at most 60 test cases. Each test case starts with an integer N , the number of
vertices in the polygon given. The value of N satisfies 3  N  10000. The next N lines contain a pair
of integers each, x and y, specifying the coordinates of each vertex of the polygon in counterclockwise
order (the z-coordinate of each vertex is always 0). These coordinate values will always be between
-10000 and 10000 inclusive. The last line consists of two real numbers 0  R  100 and 1  D  1000.
These two numbers specify the light source: it is a flat circular source of uniform intensity along the
plane z = D, centred on (0, 0, D) and radius R. The wall is a flat, smooth and infinitely large surface
along the plane of z = D. You may assume that there is no other light source in the vicinity. You
may also assume that the input data will always be such that it specifies a polygon of non-zero area
and that the same point will not be present in the data multiple times.

The last input is followed by a single 0 on the line, which should not be processed.

```

## Sample Input

```
There should be one single line of output for each test case. It should be formatted as Case c: u
p, where c is the case number with the first case designated as case 1, u is the area of the umbra (the
part of the shadow that is completely dark, usually near the center) and p is the area of the rest of
the shadow (the lighter part of the shadow that is only partially dark) called penumbra. The diagram
above should help clarify the terms. Both areas should be within a relative error bound of 1e-6 of the
actual value. See the sample output below for further clarification.
