## Input

```text
Given is a set of integers and then a sequence of queries. A query gives you a number and asks to find
a sum of two distinct numbers from the set, which is closest to the query number.
```

## Output

```text
Input contains multiple cases.

Each case starts with an integer n (1 < n  1000), which indicates, how many numbers are in the
set of integer. Next n lines contain n numbers. Of course there is only one number in a single line. The
next line contains a positive integer m giving the number of queries, 0 < m < 25. The next m lines
contain an integer of the query, one per line.

Input is terminated by a case whose n = 0. Surely, this case needs no processing.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output should be organized as in the sample below. For each query output one line giving the query
value and the closest sum in the format as in the sample. Inputs will be such that no ties will occur.

```
