The political puzzle game

Occasionally during presidential elections puzzles get created
for campaign purposes, some of them becoming fervidly pop-
ular, like this little game called The Political Puzzle Game.

It consists of a 5  5 board, and nine pieces, each one
representing a diferent candidate. The object of the game is
to capture eight of the pieces, and leave the last one (the
winner) on the square located at the centre of the board. We
are not particularly interested in which candidate wins the
game, but in doing this in the minimum number of moves
possible.

A move means sliding any piece to an adjacent square,
or jumping over another piece, removing the piece that was
jumped over. All moves, whether they capture a piece or not,
can be performed horizontally, vertically or diagonally. You
can capture only one piece in one move, and only if there is a
free square directly on the opposite side of the captured piece
(the landing square).

You receive a description of a board, where a number of pieces (between 1 and 9) are arbitrarily
scattered throughout the board. Your task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to
win the game with any of its pieces.

## Output

```
Input starts with a positive integer T , that denotes the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a blank line. The next fve lines contain fve characters each, and they describe
the board. Each character of the board will be either a dot (.) or an asterisk (*). Dots represent
empty squares, and asterisks represent game pieces. The number of pieces will be always between 1
and 9 (inclusive).

T  100

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, print the case number, followed by the minimum number of moves required to
capture all pieces on the board except for one, leaving the winner on the center of the board.

Explanation of Sample Cases
For the frst case, consider enumerating the pieces as follows:

.....

.123.

.456.

.789.

.....

Then one way to solve it in eight moves can be as follows:

 2 jumps 6.

 5 jumps 8.

 2 jumps 9.

 7 jumps 2.

 5 jumps 7.

 5 jumps 3.

 5 jumps 1.

 5 jumps 4.

For the second case, the topmost piece jumps over the other, and then moves back into the center,
for a total of 2 moves.

For the third case, there is an interesting way to solve it in 5 moves, which is left as an exercise.
