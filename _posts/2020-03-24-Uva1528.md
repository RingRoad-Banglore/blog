title: Uva 01528  Reserve Bookshelf
---


## Input

```text

A very small rural library has only one shelf dedicated to reserve books. (Reserve books are deemed
important to a large number of library users and can therefore be checked out only for very short
periods of time.)

 When the librarys staff places a book on reserve, the book is put on the reserve shelfs left end.
All books that were already on the reserve shelf must therefore be moved to the right, just enough
to make room for the new book on the shelf.

 When a reserve book is checked out and subsequently returned, it is also put on the reserve shelfs
left end, as if it were just being placed on reserve.

 What happens when the shelf is full? When a book is placed on reserve, or when a previously
checked out reserve book is returned, and there is not enough room on the reserve bookshelf,
then, starting at the right end, as many books (but no more) are removed from the reserve shelf
(they are taken off reserve) as needed in order to make room for the book to be put on the
reserve bookshelf.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input file contains a single integer, the total available space on the reserve book
shelf (when it is empty), measured in millimeters (1 inch equals about 25 millimeters). Its value will
be at least 250 and at most 1500.

Your program will start with an empty reserve book shelf.
Each subsequent line of input will start with one of the four commands ADD, CHECKOUT, RETURN,

PRINT in upper case letters, starting in column 1.

 There will not be any trailing blank spaces in the input file.

 The ADD command:

 The command is followed by a title (starting in column 10), consisting of at most 29 printable
characters.

 The title is followed (starting in column 40) by the thickness of the book (the amount of
book shelf space it will require), a positive integer, not greater than 150.

 The effect of the ADD command will be to place a new title on reserve, as described above.

 Duplicate titles:

 Once a particular title has been ADDed, it will not be ADDed again as long as that book is
on the reserve book shelf or has been checked out. However, if a title has been forced off
the reserve book shelf (by another ADD command or by a RETURN command) then that
title may appear in a subsequent ADD command (with the same thickness as before).

 The CHECKOUT command:

 The command is followed by a title (starting in column 10) which is currently on the reserve
shelf.

 The effect of the CHECKOUT command is to remove the specified title from the reserve shelf
(until it is placed back on the reserve shelf by a subsequent RETURN command.



Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 1528  Reserve Bookshelf 2/3

 A CHECKOUT may create a gap between two books (for example, when The C Programming
Language is checked out in the example shown). Such a gap will count as part of the free
space.

 The RETURN command:

 The command is followed by a title (starting in column 10) which is currently checked out.

 The effect of the RETURN command is to put the specified book to the left end of the reserve
shelf, as described in the introductory paragraphs.

 The PRINT command:

 The effect of the command will be to display in the output file:

 the title and thickness of each book currently on the reserve shelf, one book per line, in
the (left-to-right) order in which the books are currently on the reserve shelf,

 the currently available space on the reserve shelf, and
 one blank line.
