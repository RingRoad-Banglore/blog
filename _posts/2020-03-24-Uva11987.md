title: Uva 11987  Almost UnionFind
---


```
I hope you know the beautiful Union-Find structure. In this problem, youre to implement something
similar, but not identical.

The data structure you need to write is also a collection of disjoint sets, supporting 3 operations:

1 p q Union the sets containing p and q. If p and q are already in the same
set, ignore this command.

2 p q Move p to the set containing q. If p and q are already in the same
set, ignore this command.

3 p Return the number of elements and the sum of elements in the set
containing p.

Initially, the collection contains n sets: {1}, {2}, {3}, , {n}.
```

## Input

```
There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers n and m (1 
n,m  100, 000), the number of integers, and the number of commands. Each of the next m lines
contains a command. For every operation, 1  p, q  n. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF).

```

## Output

```
For each type-3 command, output 2 integers: the number of elements and the sum of elements.

Explanation
Initially: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}
Collection after operation 1 1 2: {1,2}, {3}, {4}, {5}
Collection after operation 2 3 4: {1,2}, {3,4}, {5} (we omit the empty set that is produced when
taking out 3 from {3})
Collection after operation 1 3 5: {1,2}, {3,4,5}
Collection after operation 2 4 1: {1,2,4}, {3,5}

```

## Sample Input

```
5 7
1 1 2
2 3 4
1 3 5
3 4
2 4 1
3 4
3 3

```

## Sample Output

```
3 12
3 7
2 8
```
