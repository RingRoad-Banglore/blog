title: Uva 12215  Rectangle of Permutation
---


## Input

```
We want to build a rectangle where each row is a permutation of 0 to N-1. We want to make this
rectangle with as many rows as possible while maintaining the following constraints.

N1
j=0

Ei,j  Ai and
N1
j=0

Ei,j  Bi, where Ei,j =
{
Di,j  Ci,j when Di,j > Ci,j
0 when Di,j  Ci,j

Di,j is the number of occurrences of integer j in the column i. C is a matrix of N rows and N columns
will be given as input. A and B are two sequences of size N will be given as input. Given N , A, B, C
build a rectangle with the largest possible number of rows.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input contains T (1  T  50) the number of test cases. It is followed by T test
cases. Each test case starts with an integer N (1  N  30) indicating the number of columns in the
rectangle. Next line contains N integers separated by single spaces.

These integers are A0 to AN1 (0  Ai  10). Next line contains N integers separated by single
spaces. These integers are B0 to BN1 (0  Bi  10). Each of the next N line contains N integers in
each line. The integer on row i and column j is Ci,j (0  Ci,j  4) (i and j starts from zero). A blank
line will follow each test case.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case the first line of the output will be in the following format Case #C: R. Quotes
are for clarity only. C is the test case number starting from 1. R is the maximum possible rows of the
rectangle. Each of the next R lines should contain N integer in each line separated by spaces. Each of
these N integers in each line should be a permutation of 0 to N 1. The whole RN rectangle should
maintain the constraints as described in the problem statement.
