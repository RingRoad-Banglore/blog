title: Uva 00121  Pipe Fitters
---


```
Filters, or programs that pass processed data through in some changed form, are an important class
of programs in the UNIX operating system. A pipe is an operating system concept that permits data
to flow between processes (and allows filters to be chained together easily.)

This problem involves maximizing the number of pipes that can be fit into a storage container (but
its a pipe fitting problem, not a bin packing problem).

A company manufactures pipes of uniform diameter. All pipes are stored in rectangular storage
containers, but the containers come in several different sizes. Pipes are stored in rows within a container
so that there is no space between pipes in any row (there may be some space at the end of a row), i.e.,
all pipes in a row are tangent, or touch. Within a rectangular cross-section, pipes are stored in either
a grid pattern or a skew pattern as shown below: the two left-most cross-sections are in a grid pattern,
the two right-most cross-sections are in a skew pattern.

Note that although it may not be apparent from the diagram, there is no space between adjacent
pipes in any row. The pipes in any row are tangent to (touch) the pipes in the row below (or rest on
the bottom of the container). When pipes are packed into a container, there may be left-over space
in which a pipe cannot be packed. Such left-over space is packed with padding so that the pipes cannot
settle during shipping.
```

## Input

```
The input is a sequence of cross-section dimensions of storage containers. Each cross-section is given
as two real values on one line separated by white space. The dimensions are expressed in units of pipe
diameters. All dimensions will be less than 27. Note that a cross section with dimensions a b can also
be viewed as a cross section with dimensions b a.

```

## Output

```
For each cross-section in the input, your program should print the maximum number of pipes that can
be packed into that cross section. The number of pipes is an integer  no fractional pipes can be
packed. The maximum number is followed by the word grid if a grid pattern results in the maximal
number of pipes or the word skew if a skew pattern results in the maximal number of pipes. If the
pattern doesnt matter, that is the same number of pipes can be packed with either a grid or skew
pattern, then the word grid should be printed.
