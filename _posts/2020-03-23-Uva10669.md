10669 Three powers
Consider the set of all non-negative inte-
ger powers of 3.

S = {1, 3, 9, 27, 81, . . .}

Consider the sequence of all subsets
of S ordered by the value of the sum of
their elements. The question is simple:
find the set at the n-th position in the
sequence and print it in increasing order
of its elements.

## Input
Each line of input contains a number n,
which is a positive integer with no more
than 19 digits. The last line of input con-
tains ‘0’ and it should not be processed.

## Output
For each line of input, output a single
line displaying the n-th set as described
above, in the format used in the sample
output.

## Sample Input
<p>1</p><p>7</p><p>14</p><p>783</p><p>1125900981634049</p><p>0</p><p></p>

## Sample Output
<p>{ }</p><p>{ 3, 9 }</p><p>{ 1, 9, 27 }</p><p>{ 3, 9, 27, 6561, 19683 }</p><p>{ 59049, 3486784401, 205891132094649, 717897987691852588770249 }</p>
