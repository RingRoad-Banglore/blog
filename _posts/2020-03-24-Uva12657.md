title: Uva 12657  Boxes in a Line
---


## Input

```text

You have n boxes in a line on the table numbered 1 . . . n from left to right. Your task is to simulate 4
kinds of commands:

 1 X Y : move box X to the left to Y (ignore this if X is already the left of Y )

 2 X Y : move box X to the right to Y (ignore this if X is already the right of Y )

 3 X Y : swap box X and Y

 4: reverse the whole line.

Commands are guaranteed to be valid, i.e. X will be not equal to Y .
For example, if n = 6, after executing 1 1 4, the line becomes 2 3 1 4 5 6. Then after executing

2 3 5, the line becomes 2 1 4 5 3 6. Then after executing 3 1 6, the line becomes 2 6 4 5 3 1.
Then after executing 4, then line becomes 1 3 5 4 6 2
```

## Output

```text
There will be at most 10 test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing 2 integers n, m
(1  n,m  100, 000). Each of the following m lines contain a command.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, print the sum of numbers at odd-indexed positions. Positions are numbered 1 to n
from left to right.

```

## Sample Output

```text
6 4

1 1 4

2 3 5

3 1 6

6 3

1 1 4

2 3 5
