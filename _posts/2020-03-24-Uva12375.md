title: Uva 12375  Truchet Tiling
---


## Input

```text
In 1704 French mathematician Sebastien Truchet proposed a
tiling system that started with simple motifs and used its ro-
tations and random placement to create quite interesting tiling
patterns. In this problem we will calculate the area enclosed by
the curves in a special case of his tiling system.

Observe the two motifs here. Motif 0 is a square of length 2
units on each side. There are two circles with radius 1 unit drawn
at two opposite corners of the square. Motif 1 is just a 90 degrees
rotation of the first one (or you can think of it as drawing the
circles on the other two corners).

Using just two basic motifs as shown here, we can tile an area to create rather interesting artistic
patterns. They do not have to be symmetrically placed  we can lay out these motifs randomly to
cover an area. If we then use a tool like paint bucket (found in most paint programs) at a particular
point in the pattern, we can color a contiguous region with one color.

In this problem youll be given a description of such a tiling pattern and then be asked how much
area would it color if we use paint bucket starting at specific points.

Here is one illustration:
We have the motifs randomly placed on a

9  9 grid. Then we used a black color at po-
sition (2, 4) (Here 2 denotes the distance from
the top and 4 denotes the distance from left).
It colored all the contiguous region it found
bounded by the grids boundary and the curves
themselves. We could achieve the same effect if
we used the color at position (4, 6), (0, 6), (1,
7) etc. However, using the paint bucket on the
perimeter of the curves (such as (3, 4)) will only
color the perimeter line of the curves. They will
not fill up a region with any color.

## Output

```text
The first line of the input starts with the num-
ber of test cases T (1  T  100). In the next
T lines you get the description of T test cases.
For each test case the first line of the test case

gives the dimension of the area in rows and columns format. You can assume that rows R and columns
C are at most 100 units long (0 < R,C  100). For each of the next R lines youll have the row
description given in binary form. The basic motifs are numbered 0 and 1. For example, the accom-
panying pictures first row can be described as 0001. After the R row descriptions youll be given
Q (1  Q  100)  the number of queries. Each query will be of the form x (0  x  2R) and y
(0  y  2C) where x and y are integers denoting the row and column number where you will use the
paint bucket tool.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print the test case number as Case C: in one line where C is the test case number.
That line will be followed by Q lines of output for the queries on that test case. For each query print
one number giving the area enclosed by the boundary and the curves that contain that point. If the
point in question itself lies on a curve, you can assume the enclosed area to be zero. Your answer for
each query must be rounded to 4 (four) digits after the decimal point. If the output is 0 (zero) make
sure that you dont print it as -0.0000. Other than that inputs will be such that small precision error
will not cause difference in output.
