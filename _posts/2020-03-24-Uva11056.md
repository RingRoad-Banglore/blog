```
Its time for a new Formula 1 race and the board of directors decided that its also time for a new
chronometer system. They bought all the ultra-modern radar-laser-microwave sensors to install in the
starting line, but just realized the manufacturer didnt provide the software to rank the cars.

Thats how you come to the game. The board of directors wants you to write a program that
receives the time each pilot spent on their qualification lap and prints the starting grid for the race (i.e.
the order in which the pilots must start the race). And they want it fast! I bet you can do it in the
time of a pit stop!

(If you dont know the rules that make the starting grid in Formula 1, consider that the least time
the pilot spend on the qualification lap the best, i.e. the closest he will start of the beginning of the
grid).
```

## Input

```
The input file contains several input sets. The description of each set is given below:

Each set starts with one integer N (1  N  100), the number of participant pilots in the race, on
the first line.

Then, N lines in the format S : X min Y sec Z ms; will follow (quotes for clarity only). The
value S represents the name of the pilot and consists of a string of 1 to 20 letters. The integers X
(0  C  59), Y (0  C  59) and Z (0  C  999) represent the number of minutes, seconds and
milliseconds, respectively, that the pilot spent on his qualification lap.

There is a blank line after each input set. Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Output

```
For each input set, your program must produce the starting grid, i.e. the order in which the pilots must
start the race, in the following format. For each row in the grid (a pair of cars that start the race side
by side), print a line containing Row R, where R represents the row number starting from 1, followed
by two other lines containing the name of the pilots (as appear in the input) that start the race from
that row (in order of classification). If one row contains only one pilot, just print one line after the row
number. If there are two pilots with the same name on a test case, they are different pilots and the
output must contain both pilots. If two or more pilots are tied in the classification time, sort them by
their names (lexicographically, case-insensitive comparisons).

Print a blank line after each test case.
