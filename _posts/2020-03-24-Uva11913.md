title: Uva 11913  Tape Recording

## Input

```text
Jay is a huge TV lover. He spends all his leisure time in the
world of TV programmes; soap operas, game shows, charity
shows, news, cartoons, cookery programmes... Jay watches
them all.

For many years there were only two TV channels in his
town. In order not to miss any shows, Jay has bought two
VHS tape recorders, so that he can record all shows on tapes
and watch them at any time he wants. But now, more and
more channels are in service, and Jay cannot afford buying
more tape recorders. Thus, he would like to make the best use of the existing two recorders. Sometimes
he would have to give up some great shows reluctantly. Moreover, he thinks that watching just part of
a TV programme is no fun, so if he records a programme, he records the full show.

To all shows in the TV schedule Jay has assigned a fun value in the range [1, 5]. Your job is to write
a program to compute the maximum total fun that Jay can get if he uses his recorders optimally.

## Output

```text
Input consists of several test cases. Each test begins with a line containing an integer n (1  n  100).
Then n lines follow, each giving the starting time, ending time, fun value and name of a show. The
times will be in the format HH:MM , ranging from 00:00 to 23:59. No shows share the same name
within a list, and no names have more than 60 characters.

A day of TV broadcasting starts at 6 am. All TV programmes listed in the input are on the same
day, and none will encompass 6 am. Also, the duration of any single show will not exceed the length
of a tape, and the time taken to press the Record button etc. is negligible. You can further assume
that Jay has a virtually unlimited supply of VHS tapes at home (just like any other TV maniac).

Input ends with a dummy case where n = 0. Your program should ignore this test case.

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output the maximum fun that Jay can get. Of course Jay will not record a same
show in two tapes.
