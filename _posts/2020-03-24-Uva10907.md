title: Uva 10907  Art Gallery
---


## Input

```text
The ancient art gallery is a special one and it
is convex in shape. But recently due to the ex-
tension, one of its vertex becomes concave (a
vertex which produces an angle greater than
180 degree). Previously, the whole art gallery
was visible by the lights. But it may not be
the case now. The authority wants to know the
area covered by each of the light ( Just turn
on one light and keep others off ) now. In the
following figure, dark region shows the area cov-
ered by the light which is on.
```

## Output

```text
Each dataset will start with a positive integer,
N (1  N  20). In next few lines there
will be N Cartesian coordinates defining the art
gallery. The points will be in anti-clockwise order. The coordinates will be integer and their absolute
value will not exceed 1000. Then in next line there will be a positive integer L. Following L lines will
contain the coordinates of the lights which will also be integers. The lights are guaranteed not to be
outside the gallery. Exactly one vertex of the gallery will be concave.

Input is terminated by EOF.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each set of input print Gallery #i where i is the number of gallery to be considered (starting
with 1). In next L lines print the area covered by jth light. Use two digits after decimal point in case
of covered area.

```
