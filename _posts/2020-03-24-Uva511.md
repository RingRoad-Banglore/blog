title: Uva 00511  Do You Know the Way to San Jose
---


```
The Internet now offers a variety of interactive map facilities, so that users can see either an overview
map of a large geographic region or can zoom in to a specific street, sometimes even a specific building,
on a much more detailed map. For instance, downtown San Jose might appear in a map of California,
a map of Santa Clara county, and a detailed street map.

Suppose you have a large collection of rectangular maps and you wish to design a browsing facility
that will process a sequence of map requests for locations at various levels of map detail. Locations
are expressed using location names. Each location name has a unique pair of real coordinates (x, y).
Maps are unique, labeled with identifying map names, and defined by two pairs of real coordinates
(x1, y1)(x2, y2)representing opposite corners of the map. All map edges are parallel to the standard
Cartesian x and y axes. A map and a location can have the same name. The aspect ratio of a map is
the ratio of its height to its width (where width is measured in the x direction and height is measured
in the y direction).

The level of detail of a map can be approximated by using the rectangular area represented by the
map; i.e., assume that a map covering a smaller area contains more detailed information. Maps can
overlap one another. If a location (x, y) lies within two or more maps having equal areas, the preferred
map (at that level of detail) is the one in which the location is nearest the center of the map. If the
location is equidistant from the centers of two overlapping maps of the same area, then the preferred
map (at that level of detail) is the one whose aspect ratio is nearest to the aspect ratio of the browser
window, which is 0.75. If this still does not break the tie, then the preferred map is the one in which
the location is furthest from the lower right corner of the map (this heuristic is intended to minimize
the need for scrolling in the users browser window). Finally, if there is still a tie, then the preferred
map is the one containing the smallest x-coordinate.

The maximum detail level available for a given location is the maximal number of maps of different
areas that contain the location. Clearly, different locations can have different maximum detail levels.
The map at detail i for the location is the map with the ith largest area among a maximal set of maps
of the distinct area containing the location. Thus, the map at detail level 1 for the location will be the
least detailed (largest area) map containing the location and the map at the maximum detail level will
be the most detailed (smallest area) map containing the location.

## Input

```
The input file consists of a set of maps, locations, and requests; it is organized as follows:

 The word MAPS, in all uppercase letters and on a line by itself, introduces a set of one or more
maps. Following the set heading, each map is described by a single line consisting of a map name
(an alphabetic string with no leading, trailing, or embedded blanks) and two real coordinate
pairsx1 y1 x2 y2representing opposite corners of the map.

 The word LOCATIONS, in all uppercase letters and on a line by itself, introduces a set of one or
more locations. Following this heading, each location is described by a line consisting of a location
name (an alphabetic string with no leading, trailing, or embedded blanks) and a real coordinate
pairx yrepresenting the center of the location.

 The word REQUESTS, in all uppercase letters and on a line by itself, introduces a set of zero or
more requests. Following this heading, each request is described by a line consisting of a location

name (an alphabetic string with no leading, trailing, or embedded blanks) followed by a positive
integer representing the desired detail level for that location.

 The word END, in all uppercase and on a line by itself, terminates the file.

All map and location data preceding the requests are valid. There will be no duplicate maps. The
result of processing a valid request is the name of the map containing the given location at the given
detail level (using the tie-breaking rules described above). Invalid requests can result from requesting
unknown location names, locations that do not appear in any map, or detail levels that exceed the
number of maps of different areas containing the location.

The following example should illustrate all these definitions:

```

## Output

```
Each request must be echoed to the output. If the request is valid, display the name of the map
satisfying the request. If the location is not on a map, display a message to that effect. If the location
is on the map but the detail level is too large, display the name of the map of the smallest available
area (largest possible detail level).

```
