title: Uva 10730  Antiarithmetic?
---


## Input

```text
A permutation of n is a bijective
function of the initial n natural
numbers: 0, 1, . . . , n 1. A permu-
tation p is called antiarithmetic if
there is no subsequence of it form-
ing an arithmetic progression of
length bigger than 2, i.e. there are
no three indices 0  i < j < k < n
such that (pi, pj , pk) forms an arith-
metic progression.

For example, the sequence (2, 0, 1, 4, 3) is an antiarithmetic permutation of 5. The sequence (0,
5, 4, 3, 1, 2) is not an antiarithmetic permutation as its first, fifth and sixth term (0, 1, 2) form an
arithmetic progression; and so do its second, forth and fifth term (5, 3, 1).

Your task is to check whether a given permutation of n is antiarithmetic.
```

## Output

```text
There are several test cases, followed by a line containing 0. Each test case is a line of the input file
containing a natural number 3  n  10000 followed by a colon and then followed by n distinct numbers
separated by whitespace. All n numbers are natural numbers smaller than n.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case output one line with yes or no stating whether the permutation is antiarithmetic
or not.

```

## Sample Output

```text
3: 0 2 1
5: 2 0 1 3 4
6: 2 4 3 5 0 1
0

```
