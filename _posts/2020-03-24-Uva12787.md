There was a book lying near Alice on the table, ..., she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could
read,   for its all in some language I dont know, she said to herself. It was like this.

YKCOWREBBAJ
sevot yhtils eht dna ,gillirb sawT
;ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD

,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA
.ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA

She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck her. Why, its a Looking-glass book, of
course! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again.

This was the poem that Alice read.
JABBERWOCKY
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,

And the mome raths outgrabe.

Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass

Some few days later, Alice noticed that when she said 51, some people understood 15 and, some
others, 51. And when she said 43, they understood 34 or 43. Of course, such a risk of misunderstanding
is a serious trouble to play arithmetic games. Then she realized that there was no problem saying 343,
because in this case the others would always understand what she meant.

But, what can she do if she wanted to say 51, anyway? She discovered that she could say the
number in base 2, since 512 = 110011. She could say a number n in a base b if n was written in that
base as a palindrome, i.e., as a number that reads the same from left to right than from right to left.
For example, neither 4310 = 43 nor 432 = 101011 are palindromes, but 436 = 111 is a palindrome.

Your task is to write a program to help Alice calculating the smallest base b  2 for which a given
number n is a palindrome, if there is such a base b. The number n is given in base 10.
```

## Input

```
The input contains several test cases, each one described by one single line with an integer number n,
written in base 10 (1  n  106).

```

## Output

```
For each test case, output a line with the smallest base b  2 in which the number n is written as a
palindrome, if there is such a base. If there is not such a base, answer a line with a 0 value.
