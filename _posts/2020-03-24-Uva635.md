title: Uva 00635  Clock solitaire
---


## Input

```text
One card set is (52 cards) used in clock solitaire. Each card corresponds to one hour.

J one oclock
2,3,...,10 2 oclock, 3 oclock etc.
A 11 oclock
Q 12 oclock
K centre of the clock board

We give out cards placing (covers up) 4 cards per each hour and centre of clock board. The aim if
the game is to uncover all the cards and rearranging them so that each card lies on its corresponding
hour.

The first move is to uncover the lowest card from the centre. Holding one card in hand we can make
only one sort of movement  place the card on its corresponding hour (or in the centre if it is a king)
and take the lowest card from its heap. We iterate this procedure as long as possible.

The game is successful if you manage to uncover all the cards and  consequently  lost if even
single card remains uncovered.

Widely known International Association of Solitaire Fans was curious which card sequence produces
best results (meaning highest number of successful games). You are to help them by writing a program
which reads the initial cards layout and checks how many of 52 cyclic shifts of this string are successful.
```

## Output

clockwise, starting from the lowest on the first hour and finishing with the uppermost in the center.
