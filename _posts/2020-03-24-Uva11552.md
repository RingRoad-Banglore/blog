## Input

```text
A common way to uniquely encode a string is by replacing its consecutive repeating characters (or
chunks) by the number of times the character occurs followed by the character itself. For example,
the string aabbbaabaaaa may be encoded as 2a3b2a1b4a. (Note for this problem even a single
character b is replaced by 1b.)

Suppose we have a string S and a number k such that k divides the length of S. Let S1 be the
substring of S from 1 to k, S2 be the substring of S from k+1 to 2k, and so on. We wish to rearrange
the characters of each block Si independently so that the concatenation of those permutations S has
as few chunks of the same character as possible. Output the fewest number of chunks.

For example, let S be uuvuwwuv and k be 4. Then S1 is uuvu and has three chunks, but may
be rearranged to uuuv which has two chunks. Similarly, S2 may be rearranged to vuww. Then S,
or S1S2, is uuuvvuww which is 4 chunks, indeed the minimum number of chunks.
```

## Output

```text
The input begins with a line containing t (1  t  100), the number of test cases. The following t lines
contain an integer k and a string S made of no more than 1000 lowercase English alphabet letters. It
is guaranteed that k will divide the length of S.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of chunks after we rearrange
S as described above.

```

## Sample Output

```text
