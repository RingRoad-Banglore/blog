title: Uva 10942  Can of Beans
---


## Input

```
Starving, Jimmy went to the cupboard to see what he could make for
lunch. Unfortunately for him, the only food item inside was an old can
of beans. Under normal circumstances, he wouldnt think about it, but
the old, beaten up appearance of the can worried him. How long has
this been in here?, he wondered out loud.

Turning the can over, he saw three cryptic numbers stamped into
the bottom: 09 06 03

Quickly realizing it was the best before date, he heaved a sigh of
relief: the can was still good for another 4 years or so...if the first
number was a year. Suddenly realizing the 09 could be the day and
not the year, he wasnt so sure anymore. In fact, if the last number (the
03) was the year, then the can could have gone bad 2 years before!
(This Jimmy lives in the year 2005).

You have to help out Jimmy! Given the century that Jimmy lives in
and the three numbers on the bottom of the can, print out the earliest
valid date the can could have gone bad.
```

## Output

```
The first line will contain an integer t which is the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists
of four integers, c, x, y, z on a line by themselves. c+1 is the century that Jimmy lives in, and is in the
range 0  c < 230. x, y, z are the possible day, month, and year in the century but in an unknown
order. All are in the range 0  x, y, z < 100

Recall we want the earliest VALID date, so dont forget about leap years! Here are a few facts you
can use about leap years:

 the year 0 is a leap year;

 every fourth year after 0 is a leap year, but

 every hundred year is NOT a leap year, but

 every four hundred year IS a leap year.

This isnt exactly true in our world, but Jimmy lives on a different planet in a different galaxy.
Strangely enough, they use a calendar system astonishingly like our own, speak English, and also eat
beans packaged in cans!

Jimmys calendar, like ours, has the months January through December, numbered 01 through 12.
Each of Jimmys months contain the same number of days as our months on the standard, Gregorian
calendar. The days within months are numbered from 01 to 31, and no month has more than 31 days.
On a leap year, Jimmys Februaries also have 29 days instead of 28.

```

## Sample Input

```
The output will contain the integers in the order Y Y MM DD of the earliest possible date at which
the can of beans could have gone bad. If there is no valid date, print -1. Each test case should be
written on a line by itself.
