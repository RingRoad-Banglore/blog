title: Uva 10745  Dominant Strings
---


## Input

```text
Given two strings s1 and s2, we say that s1 dominates s2 if the (multi)set of characters in s1 is a proper
superset of the (multi)set of characters in s2. For instance, acmicpc dominates camp, but it does
not dominate chimp or macpac. For a set S of strings, we call the strings in S which are not
dominated by any string in S the dominant strings of S (even if they do not dominate any strings in
S).

Now, your task is simply to find all the dominant strings of a set of strings.
```

## Output

```text
The input contains a single set of strings, with one string per line. Each string consists of at least one
and at most ten lower-case alphabetic characters. There will be at most 15000 strings, and no two
strings will be identical. Input is terminated by end-of-file.

```

## Sample Input

```text
Output consists of all dominant strings in the input set, in alphabetical order, one word per line.

```

## Sample Output

```text
acmicpc
cccp
macpac
chimp
camp

```
