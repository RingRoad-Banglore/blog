title: Uva 11297  Census
---


## Input

```text
This year, there have been many problems with population calculations, since in some cities, there
are many emigrants, or the population growth is very high. Every year the ACM (for Association
for Counting Members) conducts a census in each region. The country is divided into N  2 regions,
consisting of an N  N grid of regions. Your task is to find the least, and the greatest population in
some set of regions. Since in a single year there is no significant change in the populations, the ACM
modifies the population counts by some number of inhabitants.
```

## Output

```text
In the first line you will find N (0  N  500), in following the N lines you will be given N numbers,
wich represent, the initial population of city C[i, j]. In the following line is the number Q (Q  40000),
followed by Q lines with queries:

There are two possible queries:

 q x1 y1 x2 y2 which represent the coordinates of the upper left and lower right of where you
must calculate the maximum and minimum change in population.

 c x y v indicating a change of the population of city C[x, y] by value v.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each query, q x1 y1 x2 y2 print in a single line the greatest and least amount of current population.
Separated each output by a space.

Notice: There is only a single test case.

```
