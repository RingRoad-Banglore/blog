title: Uva 11342  Three-Square
---


## Input

```text
Lagranges four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of four
squares of integers. For example:

3 = 12 + 12 + 12 + 02
31 = 52 + 22 + 12 + 12

However some positive integers can be expressed even as the sum of three squares of non-negative
integers. For example:

3 = 12 + 12 + 12
17 = 02 + 12 + 42

In this problem you have to find expression of given integer K as the sum of three squares, or state
that it is impossible.
```

## Output

```text
The first line contains integer N (0 < N  10000), it is number of tests. Each of the next N lines
contains a positive integers K (0 < K  50000).

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test case print a line formatted like this: a b c. Where a  b  c and K = a2 + b2 + c2. If
there is more than one possible answer, print the one that comes first lexicographically. If expression
in three squares of non-negative integers do not exist print -1 (see examples).

```

## Sample Output

```text
3
13
15
17

```
