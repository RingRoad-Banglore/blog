title: Uva 13178  Is it multiple of 3
---


```
Last week Andrea explained to her little students the divisibility
rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3  she told them  if the
sum of the digits is divisible by 3.

In order for them to practise it, she decided to give them
homework. But she was in a hurry and, instead of giving them
many different numbers, she decided to give them just a few.
Each exercise was composed of a number n that should be used
to build a big number concatenating all the numbers between
1 and n. For example, for n = 2, the number would be 12, when
n = 6 would be 123,456, and for n = 13 it would be the long
12,345,678,910,111,213. Andrea asked them whether those cre-
ated numbers were or not divisible by 3.

This trick let her give them exercises with a small formulation but with a long solution. Now it is
time to check the students responses, and the idea has backfired on her.
