Consider a number maze represented as a two dimensional array of
numbers comprehended between 0 and 9, as exemplified below. The

finding the minimum cost to travel the maze from one entry point to
an exit point may pose you a reasonable challenge.

Your task is to find the minimum cost value to go from the top-left
corner to the bottom-right corner of a given number maze of size NM
where 1  N,M  999 . Note that the solution for the given example is 24.

of mazes that follow. Each maze is defined by: one line with the number of rows, N ; one line with
the number of columns, M ; and N lines, one per each row of the maze, containing the maze numbers
separated by spaces.
