title: Uva 11319  Stupid Sequence
---


## Input

```
A stupid sequence is a sequence generated by a function defined by a polynomial as shown below:

f(x) = a0 + a1x+ a2x
2 + a3x

3 + a4x
4 + a5x

5 + a6x
6

So the stupid sequence is actually f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4) . . .
You can assume that for all i (0  i  6), 0  ai  1000.
In this problem you will be given the first 1500 terms of stupid sequence, and you will have to find

the values of a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6.
```

## Output

```
First line of the input file contains an integer N (0 < N < 101) which denotes the total number of
input set. The description of each set is given below:

Each set contains 1500 lines of inputs. Each line contains a single integer. The i-th line of a set
denotes the i-th element of a stupid sequence. All these integers fit in 64-bit unsigned integer. There
is a blank line after the input of each set.

```

## Sample Input

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the values of a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6.
All these values are non-negative and less than 1001. If such values are not found print a line This is
a smart sequence! instead.

Note: As the sample input is too to include here, we write just the first 10 elements of sample cases.

```
