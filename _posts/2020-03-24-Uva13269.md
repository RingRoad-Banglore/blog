title: Uva 13269  Journey through Gridland
---


```
Alice is journeying through grid land. She starts in the southwest corner at coordinate (0, 0) and must
reach the northeast corner at (n,m), where n, m are positive integers indicating the northeast corner
is n units to the east and m units to the north. At each step she can move one unit to the east at cost
u, one unit to the north at cost v, or


2 units to the northeast (45angle) at cost w for integers u, v,

w.
The cost of a single path is the sum of the cost of all steps taken to reach the northeast corner.

Compute the sum of the cost of all possible paths that Alice can take!
```

## Input

```
A number of of inputs ( 1000), each start with the integer n, m, u, v, w (1  n,m, u, v, w  1000000).

```

## Output

```
Output the answer modulo 1000000007.
