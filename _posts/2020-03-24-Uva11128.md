title: Uva 11128  Faulty Computer
---


```
People who have decent idea about floating-point number know that floating-point numbers cannot
express the value zero. So in case of floating-point numbers very small values can be interpreted as
zero. For example in case of double and long double data type of C/C++ we cannot represent values
smaller than 1.7  10308 and 3.4  104932 respectively. While all the computers have to bear with this
fault of floating-point numbers in this problem we will have to deal with a computer with a greater
fault. Just look at the following equation:

x0 + x1

a1 + x2


a2 + x3


a3 + x4


a4 + x5


a5 + x6


a6 = 0

Here all x and all a can only take integer values. Given the values of a1, a2, , an it may be possible
to find such values of x0, x1, , xn so that the value of the LHS of above expression is nearly zero. Such
values of x can be called the integer roots of the above expression (Note that if xi were allowed to be
real numbers then there would be infinite numbers of solutions but that is not the case for for integer
solutions). Our faulty computer does all the calculations properly but whenever a value becomes below
104 (positive or negative) it considers it as zero. Given the values of a1, a2, , a6 your job is to find
the roots of the equation above in the faulty computer. To be more specific (x0, x1, . . . , x6) are the
roots of the above equation in the faulty computer if and only if

|x0 + x1

a1 + x2


a2 + x3


a3 + x4


a4 + x5


a5 + x6


a6| < 104.

To solve this problem dont consider other anomalies this fault can cause: e.g. if a1 = 0 , then

a1

cannot be zero because of this fault but we will ignore this fault.

## Input

```
First line of the input file contains an integer N (N  60) which denotes how many sets of inputs will
be there. The description of each set is given below.

Each line contains six integers which actually denotes the value of a1, a2, , a6 respectively. You
can assume that 100 > a1, a2, . . . , a6  0.

```

## Output

```
For each set of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output followed by
seven integers which denotes the values of x0, x1, , x6 : the roots of the given equation. Your solution
must be such that |xi| < 10, for i = 0 . . . 6 and of course

6
i=0 |xi| = 0. If there is no such roots then

produce an output of the form below instead:

Case X: No Solution.

If there is more than one solution then any one of the solutions will do.
