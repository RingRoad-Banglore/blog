## Input

```
In number theory, a positive integer belongs to one and only one of the following categories: Deficient,
Perfect or Abundant (DPA).

To decide the category of a positive integer n, first you have to calculate the sum of all its proper
positive divisors. If the result is less than n then n is a deficient number, if the result is equal to n then
n is a perfect number and if the result is greater than n then n is an abundant number. Remember
that the proper divisors of n dont include n itself.

For example, the proper divisors of the number 8 are 1, 2 and 4 which sum 7. Since 7 < 8 therefore
8 is a deficient number. The proper divisors of the number 6 are 1, 2 and 3 which sum 6. Since 6 = 6
therefore 6 is a perfect number. The proper divisors of the number 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 which sum
21. Since 21 > 18 therefore 18 is an abundant number.

The task is to choose the category of a positive integer n as a deficient, perfect or abundant number.

## Output

```
Input begins with an integer t (1  t  1100), the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each line
containing an integer n (2  n  1012).

```

## Sample Input

```
For each test case, you should print a single line containing the word deficient, perfect or
abundant that representing the category of the number n.
