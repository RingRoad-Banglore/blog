## Input

```
Another attempt of revising toll system is rejected by the people of Byteland. The Government is in
big trouble now. They are seeking help of Hashmat, the brave warrior and the great programmer of
Byteland to solve the problem. Hashmat has come up with a new idea to fix this toll management
problem.

There are N cities and M bidirectional highways among these cities. The government proposed
some toll (may be different toll for different highways) for each of the highways. But people think they
are being over charged. Hashmats idea was to make both the people and the Government happy. In
his plan he decided to keep the toll of the highways as it is in Governments proposal but he would
publish a special set of N  1 highways. There are two conditions for a set of N  1 highways to be
special. These N  1 highways have to connect all the cities and a person will be able to go from a
city to any other city spending minimum toll in any of these highways. Please note, using these special
highways does not guarantee minimum sum of toll but it guarantees you minimum individual toll.

People of Byteland are happy with the idea of special highway, but the Government is not happy
as they want more toll from the highway sector. They called up a meeting and formed a committee to
find two values for all the highways. Let these values be Ai and Bi for the i-th highway and defined as
follows:

1) Ai: The maximum amount of toll they can add to the i-th highway so that Hashmats set remains
special.

2) Bi: The maximum amount of toll they can decrease from the i-th highway so that Hashmats set
remains special.

In other words, if Ci is the current toll of the i-th highway, then if the Government updates the toll
of the highway to Ci + Ai (or Ci  Bi), Hashmats set remains special. Please note, while finding out
Ai and Bi other tolls remain unchanged.

This time Hashmat does not want to help the Government. He thinks this is a conspiracy against
the people of Byteland. So they came to you. Will you help them to find out Ai and Bi for all the
highways?

## Output

```
First line of the input contains a positive integer T (T < 25), denoting the number of test cases.

First line of each test contains two integer numbers N and M (1  N  10000, N  1  M 
100000), denoting the number of city and number of highway respectively. Each of the next M lines
contains the description of a highway, where the i-th line contains three integer numbers Ui, Vi and Ci
(1  Ui, V i  N , Ui = V i, 0  Ci  1000), that means there is a highway between city Ui and city
Vi and the toll of the highway is Ci. You may consider the highways to be bidirectional. Note that
the first N  1 highways in the input are the special highways. You may assume that there will be no
invalid data in the input file.

S =
M
i=1

(i Ai + i2 Bi)

If the value of Ai or Bi is infinite, replace the value with -1.
