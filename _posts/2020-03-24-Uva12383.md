## Input

```text
A simple game, called KillHer-I, is investigated in Shiraz University game design group. This game
involves two players, each with one piece, and is played on a board of n squares arranged in a line with
a fair dice of m numbers (1, 2, 3, , m). Initially, the two pieces are in squares on either ends of the
board. The players take turns to move their pieces forward by the number of squares indicated by the
dice roll. The player who completes their move in the square already occupied by the opponents piece,
captures it and wins the game. Otherwise, if a player overpasses their opponents piece in their move,
they lose. The game continues until one of the players wins (or the other one loses).

This games primary vice is that the whole game is completely decided by chance. Therefore,
another version of this game is designed, called KillHer-II. In this variant, each player may choose to
move their piece from 1 to throw-of-the-dice squares.

The designers want to know, the probability of the starting player winning the games KillHer-I and
KillHer-II independently, given the board size n and dice sides m.

## Output

```text
The first line of input contains an integer T  200 as the number of test-cases. Each of the following
T lines feature two integers n and m both less than 100,000.

```

## Sample Input

```text
For each test-case, you should print on a new line, the probability of the starting player winning first
in KillHer-I and then in KillHer-II, separated by one space. Each probability should be expressed in
exactly 4 decimal places.
