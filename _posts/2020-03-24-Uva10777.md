Let there be n doors in a mine contained room. If you choose i-th door, it either takes you to a safe
place after xi hours or it returns you to the same room after xi hours traveling. What is the expected
length of time (in hours, let P ) until you can move to the safe place?
```

## Output

```text
The first line in the input file is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each of the test cases
follows below. The first line of each case consists an integer denoting the value of n (0 < n < 100).
Each of the next n lines contains the value of xi, 0 < |xi| < 25 (if positive it takes you out, if negative
it returns you) and pi denoting the probability to choose the i-th door. You can assume that the sum
of all pi equals 1. There may be arbitrary number of spaces between the values.

```
