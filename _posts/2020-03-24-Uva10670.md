---


## Input

```
Paperwork is beginning to pile up on your desk, and ten-
sions at the workplace are starting to mount. Your boss has
threatened to fire you if you dont make any progress by the
end of the day. You currently have N units of paperwork
on your desk, and your boss demands that you have exactly
M units of paperwork left by the end of the day.

The only hope for you now is to hire help. There are
various agencies which offer paperwork reduction plans:

 For $A they will reduce your paperwork by one unit.

 For $B they will reduce your entire paperwork by half
(rounding down when necessary).

Note that work can never be reduced to less than 0.
Your task now is to produce a sorted table of agency

names and their respective minimum costs to solve your
workload problem.
```
